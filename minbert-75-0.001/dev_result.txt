hercule poirot boards the orient express in constantinople. the train is unusually crowded for the time of year. poirot secures a berth only with the help of his friend m. bouc, a director of the compagnie internationale des wagons-lits. when a mr. harris fails to show up, poirot takes his place. on the second night, poirot gets a compartment to himself. that night, in vinkovci, at about twenty-three minutes before 1:00 am, poirot wakes to the sound of a loud noise. it seems to come from the compartment next to his, which is occupied by mr. ratchett. when poirot peeks out his door, he sees the conductor knock on mr. ratchett's door and ask if he is all right. a man replies in french "ce n'est rien. je me suis trompé", which means "it's nothing. i was mistaken", and the conductor moves on to answer a bell down the passage. poirot decides to go back to bed, but he is disturbed by the fact that the train is unusually still and his mouth is dry. as he lies awake, he hears a mrs. hubbard ringing the bell urgently. when poirot then rings the conductor for a bottle of mineral water, he learns that mrs. hubbard claimed that someone had been in her compartment. he also learns that the train has stopped due to a snowstorm. poirot dismisses the conductor and tries to go back to sleep, only to be awakened again by a thump on his door. this time when poirot gets up and looks out of his compartment, the passage is completely silent, and he sees nothing except the back of a woman in a scarlet kimono retreating down the passage in the distance. the next day he awakens to find that ratchett is dead, having been stabbed twelve times in his sleep. m. bouc suggests that poirot take the case, being that it is so obviously his kind of case; nothing more is required than for him to sit, think, and take in the available evidence. however, the clues and circumstances of ratchett's death are very mysterious. some of the stab wounds are very deep, only three are lethal, and some are glancing blows. furthermore, some of them appear to have been inflicted by a right-handed person and some by a left-handed person. poirot finds several more clues in the victim's cabin and on board the train, including a linen handkerchief embroidered with the initial "h", a pipe cleaner, and a button from a conductor's uniform. all of these clues suggest that the murderer or murderers were somewhat sloppy. however, each clue seemingly points to different suspects, which suggests that some of the clues were planted. by reconstructing parts of a burned letter, poirot discovers that mr. ratchett was a notorious fugitive from the u.s. named cassetti. five years earlier, cassetti kidnapped three-year-old american heiress daisy armstrong. though the armstrong family paid a large ransom, cassetti murdered the little girl and fled the country with the money. daisy's mother, sonia, was pregnant when she heard of daisy's death. the shock sent her into premature labour, and both she and the baby died. her husband, colonel armstrong, shot himself out of grief. daisy's nursemaid, susanne, was suspected of complicity in the crime by the police, despite her protests. she threw herself out of a window and died, after which she was proved innocent. although cassetti was caught, his resources allowed him to get himself acquitted on an unspecified technicality, although he still fled the country to escape further prosecution for the crime. as the evidence mounts, it continues to point in wildly different directions and it appears that poirot is being challenged by a mastermind. a critical piece of missing evidence&ndash;the scarlet kimono worn the night of the murder by an unknown woman&ndash;turns up in poirot's own luggage. after meditating on the evidence, poirot assembles the thirteen suspects, m. bouc and dr. constantine in the restaurant car. he lays out two possible explanations of ratchett's murder. the first explanation is that a stranger&ndash;some gangster enemy of ratchett&ndash;boarded the train at vinkovci, the last stop, murdered ratchett for reasons unknown, and escaped unnoticed. the crime occurred an hour earlier than everyone thought, because the victim and several others failed to note that the train had just crossed into a different time zone. the other noises heard by poirot on the coach that evening were unrelated to the murder. however, dr. constantine says that poirot must surely be aware that this does not fully explain the circumstances of the case. poirot's second explanation is rather more sensational: all of the suspects are guilty. poirot's suspicions were first aroused by the fact that all the passengers on the train were of so many different nationalities and social classes, and that only in the "melting pot" of the united states would a group of such different people form some connection with each other. poirot reveals that the twelve other passengers on the train and the train conductor were all connected to the armstrong family in some way: *hector macqueen, ratchett/cassetti's secretary, devoted to sonia armstrong; macqueen's father was the district attorney for the kidnapping case. he knew from his father the details of cassetti's escape from justice. *masterman, ratchett/cassetti's valet, was colonel armstrong's batman during the war and later his valet; *colonel arbuthnot was colonel armstrong's comrade and best friend; *mrs. hubbard in actuality is linda arden (née goldenberg), the most famous tragic actress of the new york stage, and was sonia armstrong's mother and daisy's grandmother; *countess andrenyi (née helena goldenberg) was sonia armstrong's sister; *count andryeni was the husband of helena andrenyi; *princess natalia dragomiroff was sonia armstrong's godmother as she was a friend of her mother; *miss mary debenham was sonia armstrong's secretary and daisy armstrong's governess; *fräulein hildegarde schmidt, princess dragomiroff's maid, was the armstrong family's cook; *antonio foscarelli, a car salesman based in chicago, was the armstrong family's chauffeur; *miss greta ohlsson, a swedish missionary, was daisy armstrong's nurse; *pierre michel, the train conductor, was the father of susanne, the armstrong's nursemaid who committed suicide; *cyrus hardman, a private detective ostensibly retained as a bodyguard by ratchett/cassetti, was a policeman in love with susanne. all these friends and relations had been gravely affected by daisy's murder and outraged by cassetti's subsequent escape. they took it into their own hands to serve as cassetti's executioners, to avenge a crime the law was unable to punish. each of the suspects stabbed ratchett once, so that no one could know who delivered the fatal blow. twelve of the conspirators participated to allow for a "twelve-person jury", with count andrenyi acting for his wife, as she&ndash;daisy's aunt&ndash;would have been the most likely suspect. one extra berth was booked under a fictitious name&ndash;harris&ndash;so that no one but the conspirators and the victim would be on board the coach, and this fictitious person would subsequently disappear and become the primary suspect in ratchett's murder. (the only person not involved in the plot would be m. bouc, for whom the cabin next to ratchett was already reserved.) the main inconvenience for the murderers was the occurrence of a snowstorm and the presence of a detective, which caused complications to the conspirators that resulted in several crucial clues being left behind. poirot summarizes that there was no other way the murder could have taken place, given the evidence. several of the suspects have broken down in tears as he has revealed their connection to the armstrong family, and mrs. hubbard/linda arden confesses that the second theory is correct and that colonel arbuthnot and mary debenham are in love. she then appeals to poirot, m. bouc, and dr. constantine, not to turn them in to the police. fully in sympathy with the armstrong family, and feeling nothing but disgust for the victim, bouc pronounces the first explanation as correct, and poirot and dr. constantine agree, dr. constantine suggesting that he will edit his original report of cassetti's body to comply with poirot's first deduction as he now 'recognizes' some mistakes he has made. his task completed, poirot states he has "the honour to retire from the case." arrangement of the calais coach: {| width="1450" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="margin:0 0; background-color: #ffffff" style="text-align: center; font-size: 80%" |-bgcolor="#f5f5dc" |style="border-right: 1px solid black; background:#c0c0c0"| &nbsp; || style="background:#98fb98" width="50"| &nbsp; || colspan="12" width="1200" style="text-align: center;"| corridor ||style="border-left: 1px solid black; background:#c0c0c0"| &nbsp; |-style="height:60px" |style="border-right: 1px solid black; background:#c0c0c0"| athens-paris coach ||style="border-right: 1px solid black;background:#98fb98" width="50"| michel ||style="border-right: 1px solid black; background:#da70d6" width="100"| 16. hardman||style="border-right: 1px solid black; background:#da70d6" width="100"| 15. arbuthnot || style="border-right: 1px solid black; background:#da70d6" width="100"| 14. dragomiroff ||style="border-right: 1px solid black; background:#da70d6" width="100"| 13. r. andrenyi || style="border-right: 1px solid black; background:#da70d6" width="100"| 12. h. andrenyi ||style="border-right: 1px solid black;background:#da70d6" width="100"| 3. hubbard || style="border-right: 1px solid black;background:#ff7f50" width="100"| 2. ratchett || style="background:#da70d6" width="100"| 1. poirot ||style="border-left: 1px solid black;background:#7b68ee" width="100"| 10. ohlsson11. debenham ||style="border-left: 1px solid black;background:#7b68ee" width="100"| 8. schmidt9. ||style="border-left: 1px solid black; background:#7b68ee" width="100"| 6. macqueen7. ||style="border-left: 1px solid black;background:#7b68ee" width="100"| 4. masterman5. foscarelli ||style="border-left: 1px solid black; background:#c0c0c0"| dining car |} ||| 1 ||| 6
the story reveals the fate of wilhelm von horst, the lost member of the previous book’s outer world expedition to pellucidar, which had been led by jason gridley and tarzan to rescue pellucidarian emperor david innes from the korsars. the action begins by recapping the incident in which gridley, von horst, and tarzan’s waziri warriors, led by muviro, are caught up in and separated by a horde of saber-toothed tigers’ cooperative hunt. now on his own, von horst quickly becomes lost, links up again with the waziri by accident, and gets lost again when he foolishly goes out hunting on his own. in the most powerful sequence in the book, von horst becomes prey himself when a trodon, or pterodactyl, carries him off to its nest in the crater of a dead volcano. the explorer is left poisoned and paralyzed together with other victims, all of them intended as a living larder to feed the creature’s young as its eggs hatch. von horst passes the time by getting to know a fellow paralytic, the native warrior dangar of sari, a member-tribe of innes' empire. from him, the outer worlder gradually learns the pellucidarian language. fortunately for von horst his clothing prevented him from receiving a full dose of venom, and he recovers from his paralysis in time to save dangar from the next hatchling. shooting the immature trodon, he makes a long strap from its hide, lasoos the parent on its next return, and after allowing it to fly off just past the lip of the crater, shoots it in turn. after securing the free end of the strap to the still paralyzed dangar, he uses it to climb out of the trap, pulling his companion up after him. in the forest at the foot of the mountain he constructs a treehouse to serve them as a secure base while dangar recovers. subsequently von horst rescues another native, skruf of basti, from a hyaenodon; skruf is on a quest to kill a tarag (saber-toothed tiger), the head of which he needs as bride-price to secure a mate. as he knows the country, von horst and dangar accompany him once the latter has recovered. in due course they encounter the desired beast, from which skruf hides in fear while his companions make the kill. despite his cowardice skruf takes the trophy, and the three continue on to the cliff-village of basti. but once there he turns traitor, not only claiming the deed as his own but betraying his companions into slavery. von horst and dangar are put to work with other slaves of basti digging new caves into the cliff. von horst becomes enamored of la-ja of lo-har, a fellow captive, and in defending her touches off a general slave revolt. he leads all the slaves to freedom, whereupon they separate to return to their native tribes. von horst elects to accompany la-ja to lo-har rather than continue to sari with dangar. the plot of the novel continues to unfold in its pattern of liberty, capture and escape, with the protagonist’s goal imperceptibly altering from rejoining his outer world comrades to romance with la-ja. the feelings of the principals, while plain to the reader, are masked from their objects of affection by culturally-based misunderstanding, as is typical of burroughs’ novels, postponing the ultimate resolution nearly to the end of the story. the initial path of von horst and la-ja takes them through the ill-reputed forest of death. within the forest are the labyrinthine caves of the gorbuses, cannibalistic albinos who, in an eerie touch, are intimated to be murderers from the outer world, reincarnated in pellucidar and consigned to this place as punishment. this is burroughs’ sole nod toward the notion that his interior world might relate in any way to the concept of a subterranean hell. falling prey to the gorbuses, von horst and la-ja are soon joined as captives by the bastians skruf and frug, who have been trailing them. the four set aside their differences to effect their escape, but afterwards the bastians betray the others’ trust, kidnapping la-ja. von horst pursues the kidnappers, incidentally coming to the aid of a tandor (mammoth) wounded by sharp stakes of bamboo, which, androcles-like, he removes. he overtakes his quarry, but before matters can be settled, he and frug are taken by the mammoth men, a native tribe utilizing mammoths as mounts; skruf and la-ja elude the interlopers. boarded on the family of a tribal warrior, von horst once again commences plotting to escape, aided by dissatisfied locals, whose support he enlists, and the friendship of thorek, a member of the tribe who had shared his earlier captivity in basti. his opportunity comes when he and other prisoners are pitted against each other, sabertooths, and mammoths in a gladiatorial-like contest. one of the mammoths proves to be old white, the beast he had aided previously; joining forces, they survive the melee and make a successful break for freedom. once again von horst happens on skruf and la-ja, intervening as they are attacked by the ganaks, or bison-men. while able to kill a few of these he ultimately falls captive to them, this time in the company of la-ja. their escape is aided by old white, after which they are separated again, but von horst falls in with another from la-ja’s country, gaj, a fellow former-prisoner of the mammoth men. gaj’s guidance enables him to follow la-ja to lo-har. there he saves her from gaz, an unwanted suitor, and he and la-ja finally acknowledge their love for each other. their union results in him becoming chief of lo-har, his new bride being the daughter of the lo-harians’ former ruler brun, who is absent searching for her. the remaining plot threads are tied up by the arrival of a party from sari led by david innes, accompanied by brun. innes, it turns out, has taken up the pledge of jason gridley at the end of the previous book to rescue the missing von horst—gridley himself, anti-climatically, is revealed to have let himself be persuaded by other members of the expedition from the outer world to leave pellucidar with them instead. von horst declines innes’ offer take him back to sari and what passes for civilization in the inner world, electing to remain in lo-har with la-ja. ||| 2 ||| 2
the book begins in 2003 with the death of dante scott's mother, father, older sister and brother at the hands of the brigands m.c. south devon president, the führer, after dante's father refuses to go through with the plans to redevelop the brigands' clubhouse, turning it into shops and flats. after saving his eighteen-month-old sister holly from the burning house (the führer attempted to burn all evidence), nine-year-old dante escapes, is put under the wing of child psychologist ross johnson, and is questioned by police in an attempt to convict the führer. on the night of the murders he was forced into a boxing fight with martin, the führer's eldest son, and got blood on his shirt; he lies to the police telling them that it was a 'nosebleed'. the defence solicitors could use the unreliability of his statement to clear the führer. much to dante's fury, the courts decide that there is insufficient evidence to convict the führer, and he is released. after moving in with a foster family, a member of another brigands chapter attempts to murder him with a bomb inside a toy car on his birthday. shaken, dante moves in under the care of ross again. dante is drugged by jennifer mitchum (the same person that drugged james adams in "the recruit") and is sent to cherub where he befriends lauren onions (soon to be changed to lauren adams). 4½ years later neil gauche, an undercover policeman who is a part of a mission to infiltrate the brigands m.c., tries to join them. unfortunately, the führer realises he is a policeman and knocks him out. ross and neil visit cherub campus and james adams, dante and lauren are assigned to a mission to infiltrate the brigands m.c. with their last names changed to raven. to avoid dante’s old friends recognizing him, dante also changes his first name to john. dante and lauren make friends with joe donnington (the führer's younger son). meanwhile james purchases a new bike, and is invited on a run with the brigands. he ends up being ‘hero worshipped’ by dirty dave after james saves his life when a member of the vengefuls tries to stab him with a sharpened hammer. at the same time jake mcewen and neil attempt to uncover a weapons deal orchestrated by the brigands, worth £600,000 by following two friends of james: julian and nigel. when james gets to the rebel tea party, a biker war breaks out between the brigands and three other gangs (the vengeful bastards, satan's prodigy and the bitch slappers), but james manages to escape. meanwhile dante and lauren end up at joe’s house party which is invaded by sixth formers ending in police being called after windows get broken and a fight breaks out between joe, dante, lauren and the party-crashers. unfortunately, julian later gets scared and confesses to his father, who is a judge. this leads to riot police arresting mcewen and neil, blowing the operation and mcewen ‘nutting’ a riot officer who insulted his intelligence, resulting in mcewen being forced to six months file sorting in the basement of cherub’s mission building. since the mission is ending, the agents are sent back to campus. before dante leaves, he sneaks into the führer's house, intent on killing him, but can't bring himself to do it. instead he carves a message into the fürher's table, implying he is a member of the vengeful bastards, to give the führer something to think about. dante takes an old photograph from the führer's study of his and the führer's family together. james also gets invited to become a stripper at "dirty dave's" devon strip joint but refuses and leaves. lauren, chloe blake (the mission controller and posing as the mother of the family) and dante get a good laugh out of this. ||| 0 ||| 6

: tagline: : always before, he had been the hunter. now he had been the prey and he had survived. he would live. he would kill again. the book tells the story of a man who tries to kill the last wild wolves in england, and the wolf, raised among humans, who will try to strike back. what if there were still wolves in england and only a few people knew it? what if one of those people was an obsessive, half-mad, extremely able hunter who was determined to have the honor of killing the last wolf in england? we are with the last wolf cubs as they are born short minutes before the slaughter begins. the female survives, wounded by the hunter, only long enough to teach her sole surviving cub a few skills before she too is killed by the man. the cub, greycub, is reared by ben and his family and, being a social animal, waits in vain for the sound or scent of a remaining wolf. this is not to be for he is the last wolf in england. regretfully leaving his human friends, he roams for years searching for sign of his species. in a bizarre but very fitting climax to the story, greycub becomes the hunter and the hunter knows, too late, the feeling of the prey. this is a raw and brutal book and, to be sure, a cautionary tale about extinction. however, the focus is on obsession verging on madness. ben, the boy who rears greycub, becomes an innocent betrayer of the wolves for it is he who first alerts the hunter to the presence of the wolf pack. the book reads like non-fiction with an almost detached manner but the brutality is so compelling that detachment on the part of the reader is nearly impossible. in fact, the feelings of readers would make for a fascinating discussion. at which point did they become engaged? did they ever feel any sympathy for the hunter? how did the author do that? also, there is some anthropomorphism present. could burgess have done the book without it? ||| 0 ||| 5

maerad and cadvan continue the search for the treesong, the key to maerad's destiny, while fleeing from enkir, the first bard of norloch, who had broken milana, maerad's mother, and sold them both into slavery. maerad and cadvan sail with a friend called owan d'aroki to the mycenean greece-like island of thorold. enkir sends a sea serpent in pursuit, which the two bards kill. having arrived on the island, they enter the bardic school of busk. maerad continues her bardic training that had been stopped abruptly in innail, learning about magery, illusions, and additional fighting skills, which improve readily. cadvan studies records in busk's extensive library, but finds nothing by which to explain the nature of the treesong. soon, busk receives a messenger from norloch who reveals that enkir has claimed the authority of high king over all the seven kingdoms, and demands the schools' undivided fealty. busk, rather than submit to norloch or be counted its enemies, pledge their "unwavering allegiance to the light", rather than to enkir; thus placing themselves beyond either possibility. later, at a seasonal festival commemorating the bards' new year, busk's first bard nerili succumbs to a 'darkness' within herself, which puts her into a trauma that prevents her creation of the ceremonial "tree of light". cadvan intervenes, salvaging the ceremony; however, nerili's experience suggests that the power of the evil nameless one is increasing, and that it is more insidious than in his previous attacks upon humanity. maerad and cadvan decide to leave the school of busk, as it is not safe for them to stay, and instead travel a long and arduous route into the island's mountainous interior, accompanied by the bard elenxi. elenxi guides the two to his goatherd brother ankil, who is nerili's grandfather. maerad and cadvan adapt to an agrarian lifestyle, continuing maerad's training in their spare time. in so doing, they learn that maerad is capable of feats of transformation beyond the abilities of any other bard, as demonstrated when she literally changes a boulder into a lion. such abilities are attributed to her elidhu (faerie) ancestry. at one point, ankil reveals a story wherein one mortal king stole a song of the world's harmony from the elidhu, splitting it in half, and by doing so brought misery. cadvan assumes this man to be sharma, who would later become the nameless one, but is subsequently suggested to be wrong. when word reaches them that they are no longer safe, maerad and cadvan leave ankil. accompanied by elenxi, they traverse an unfrenquented path to a port where they may sail with owan to the mainland. en route, they are attacked by a hull (a sorcerer corrupted by evil magic), who renders elenxi insensate and holds maerad's power under his control by use of an appropriately-named "blackstone", which copies her magic's energetic signature and enables him to manipulate it. in spite of this, maerad uses her elidhu power to change him into a rabbit. cadvan thence captures and kills the rabbit, leaving him to corrode. maerad and cadvan then awaken elenxi. the two of them take leave of elenxi at the coast of thorold, from which they then embark for the mainland. while they are on the ocean, cadvan, maerad, and owan are attacked by a monstrous "stormdog"; a huge, ferocious, wild manifestation of the storm's fury, shaped vaguely like an enormous hound. in attempting to use her magic against it in cadvan's aid, maerad suddenly understands the stormdog's true nature, and therefore calms it rather than frighten it away. thereafter the three humans make the journey safely to land. on the mainland, cadvan and maerad stay for some days and nights (possibly less than a week) at the bardic school of gent. here, maerad's training is not pursued as it was on thorold; but they are treated as honored guests. maerad soon befriends their host gahal's daughter lyla, who while not a bard has skill in the art of medicine. because her now dead suitor dernhil was born at gent, maerad is often reminded of him. owan leaves for thorold, which is his home; days later, maerad and cadvan go north on the backs of their faithful horses, darsor and imi. believing such a course to be against enkir's expectations, they ride through annar, briefly passing within reach of cadvan's former school, lirigon. in annar, they encounter economic degradation, often openly in the forms of abject poverty, misery, and child labour. near lirigon, they encounter two bards who believe enkir's statement that any who do not swear fealty to him, and especially cadvan and maerad, are traitors to the light. in the confrontation, maerad kills one of these two bards, ilar of desor. this act deeply disturbs cadvan, who takes it as indication that he has failed to correctly train maerad. when he speaks of this, maerad's own emotional insecurity etc. causes her to be harsher toward cadvan than she has been accustomed to be. fear, pride, and resentment on her part increase over the next many weeks, causing a rift between herself and cadvan. the bards and their horses proceed to the mountains called osidh elanor, intending to go beyond them to find the secret of the treesong. when they are among the mountains, they are attacked by the frost giant-like "iriduguls", who serve the elidhu called arkan the winterking. maerad cannot join with cadvan mentally to combat these iridugul, who break the mountainside and by doing so bury cadvan and darsor. imi flees in the opposite direction, while maerad, horrified at the sight of cadvan's apparent death, lies down in shock. when she awakens, maerad eats, drinks, and plays a lament for those whom she considers dead on a flute-like instrument given to her by her elidhu ancestor queen ardina. the playing of the pipes summons ardina, who at maerad's request heals some of her more life-threatening injuries, then takes her to the home of a northern tribeswoman called mirka à hadaruk, who lives as a recluse in the mountains with no companion but her dog inka. mirka nurses maerad to health over several days, during which she reveals that she is a bard, though not one trained in the annaren/thoroldian fashion; that she (mirka) belongs to the seminomadic people called pilani, from whom maerad is descended on her father's side; and that to the north exist a people called the wise kindred, who may explain the treesong. maerad, having recovered from her injuries and left mirka, travels to murask, a pilani settlement on the nearby zmarkan plains. there, she is accepted as guest by her father dorn's twin sister, sirkana à triberi. maerad stays in murask for some days, unremarked by most of the people whom she meets, and eventually leaves in the company of one dharin, a cousin of hers born to dorn's other sister. dharin and maerad ride on a dogsled to the home of the wise kindred, an inuit-like ethnicity of people who live on the volcanic islands north of zmarkan. these people, in turn, redirect maerad to the home of the necromancer inka-reb, who lives with a pack of wolves. inka-reb receives maerad and calls her a liar when she claims to need his help to define and find the treesong. angered, she demands that he speak with her. he agrees, adding that she may be unaware of having spoken a lie. inka-reb then reveals that half of the divided treesong is actually written on a lyre that maerad has inherited from her mother, and that if either the light or the dark unite the two halves, the world will be ruined. having told her this, and refusing to say more, he sends her away. maerad and dharin ride their dogsled toward the south, but are attacked on the way to murask by the jussacks, a tribe of cossack-like hunters sent by the winterking to seize maerad. dharin is killed and maerad taken prisoner. the jussacks transport her in their own dogsleds to the northeastern stronghold where arkan's life and power are situated, where they hand her to arkan. en route maerad develops a friendship with nim, the jussack warrior deputed to take care of her, and loses three fingers to frostbite, reducing her much-cherished ability to play music. in arkan's fortress, maerad is given a life of illusory luxury, her corporeal needs attended by a servant woman named gima, who views arkan as her beloved master. arkan and maerad gradually develop a beauty and the beast-like relationship, wherein she feels sexually drawn to him and he to her. during her captivity, arkan reads the writing on maerad's lyre, revealing that the symbols are an ogham-analogous script containing the power of the speech. he additionally reveals that they were created by the bard nelsor, who attempted to capture the song's power without realizing the disasters this could cause. nelsor is later suggested to have been arkan's homosexual partner. maerad is contacted during her captivity by ardina, who has changed herself into a wolf and does not initially reveal her own identity. she gives maerad a saying: "triple-tongued is triple-named". this implies that in addition to the girl's human name, maerad, and her bardic name elednor, she has another, elidhu name, which arkan does not know and therefore cannot use to control her as he uses the others. ultimately, maerad walks out of arkan's stronghold and joins ardina, who guides her to assume wolf's form. as wolves, the two escape, pursued by arkan's stormdogs. ardina delivers maerad to the wolf pack who serve inka-reb and leaves her with them. subsequently, the wolf pack take maerad to annar, where she travels, still a wolf herself, to her birthplace of pellinor. there, she encounters cadvan, who has survived the battle in the mountains and come to pellinor at ardina's advice. she resumes her human form, hears cadvan's account of his own travels through zmarkan (which he had pursued shortly in her wake), and reveals her own story to him. cadvan speculates regarding the meaning of what she has learned, suspecting that her destiny involves undoing nelsor's captivity of the speech, which neither light nor dark should have achieved. the two of them plan to seek out maerad's brother hem, who is significant to her destiny. will she ever find her destiny? ||| 2 ||| 2

rain, mattie takes esperanza, estevan, and taylor into the desert to see the natural world come to life. turtle is left with her baby-sitter, a blind woman named edna poppy. edna and turtle go to the park, and because of her disability, edna does not notice when a prowler approaches turtle. taylor returns and hears as much of the story as edna can tell: edna heard struggling and swung in the direction of the attacker with her cane. she hit him and then felt turtle tugging on the hem of her skirt. turtle does not seem hurt, but she has stopped speaking and has the same vacuous look in her eyes that she had when taylor first saw her. turtle’s trauma and the difficulties of estevan and esperanza make taylor depressed. to make matters worse, the police investigation into the attack on turtle reveals that taylor has no legal claim on turtle. taylor will be forced to give her to a state ward or find a way around the law. the social worker in tucson gives taylor the name of a legal advisor in oklahoma, where the laws are different. mattie becomes worried about estevan and esperanza’s safety. a recent crackdown on illegal immigration will force them to find a new home and a way of getting there. taylor decides she will transport estevan and esperanza to another sanctuary for illegal immigrants in oklahoma. while there, she will look for turtle’s relatives and see if they will consent to a legal adoption. once in oklahoma, taylor returns to the bar where she received turtle but finds that it has changed owners. there are no signs of the people she met there seven months before. taylor, esperanza, and estevan decide to go to the lake o’ the cherokees. during that time, taylor concocts a plan to convince the authorities in oklahoma that estevan and esperanza are turtle’s biological parents. once in the office of mr. armistead, the legal authority in oklahoma, esperanza and estevan pretend to be turtle’s biological parents. esperanza sobs real tears at the prospect of giving up turtle, and taylor realizes that esperanza is grieving the loss of her own daughter, who looked so much like turtle. taylor and turtle drop off esperanza and estevan at their new home, a church in oklahoma. taylor says a tearful goodbye to estevan. taylor then calls her mother, who comforts her. taylor and turtle head back to tucson, a place that both of them now call home.

in the aftermath of a global plague, a group of gengineered posthumans are trying to rebuild society by cloning children.the world is divided into two idealogical factions, one believing that humanity's weakness should be improved upon via genetic manipulation, and one devoted to bringing back the frozen remains of humanity 1.0. both groups contribute to the overall systems of the world, vashti working to cure black ep, and isaac working to sanitize the world for his children. pandora runs ivr, the virtual reality system, and halloween maintains his policy of american isolationism. the children are protected from the plague by a specially-engineered retrovirus called bear. one group led by champagne and vashti, in munich, germany, is composed entirely of posthuman women. the other, led by isaac, in luxor, egypt, is human. the two camps have an exchange program despite the death of hessa, isaac's daughter, in the previous exchange. haji, of the luxor camp, is going to munich this year with two of his siblings, ngozi and dalila. raised to be devout sufi muslims, haji is wary but delighted by the mores and technology in munich. the munich contingent is run more like a bootcamp than a school for the girls. vashti monitors all of their dealings and domains in ivr, and has it strictly censored. vashti also controls the girls through virtual dollars given as pocket money, used to buy things in ivr. penny, the main character of the munich base, is obsessed with power, and recognition. when she hears that pandora has become overworked, and may need an assistant, she puts all of her energy into getting the position. penny is alienated from all of her peers, especially brigit and sloane. she believes that she has supernatural powers and somehow put a "hex" on her sister, causing her to break her leg. she believes herself to be the smartest of the girls, the best athlete, and a great writer of operatic symphonies. her only desire is to be recognized, to be "queen of the inside" by controlling ivr, and thereby controlling her sisters.she is the kind of person who is only nice when she thinks someone is watching.she offers to pay brigit and sloane 5,000 dollars each (in ivr money) if they say good things about her to pandora. when her sisters demand more money, she resorts to blackmailing them. when she is informed that olivia, her younger sister, got the job instead, she threatens olivia, and resolves to "make them pay". small items, with no history or sender, keep ending up in ivr. haji finds a key, and tomi recognizes it as the key to the cryogenics lab, where the geanectis scientist halfway jim has stored a composite of his personality in a computer. haji realizes the truth, that he is a clone of halfway jim. the jim composite tells his that he must sacrifice himself, and "download" the personality, so that halfway jim, the genius, can help the world. haji is in the middle of a crisis of faith. his entire life, his religion, stresses the ultimate path to god as self-annihilation, fana, the black light that annihilates everything but god. here he is faced with the decision to destroy himself for the betterment of humanity. he must also consider what his father's intentions were in cloning him, and raising him to believe in what he does. he wonders if he was intended to be a conduit for halfway jim, his father's idol; his father's god. just as haji gets some solitude to contemplate this crisis, and penny makes out her hit list, ivr goes down. everything is exposed, vasthi's logs and evaluations of the girls that reveal a range of mood-suppressing drugs—including sex-drive suppressants—and subliminal codes that the munich camp use to keep their children in line, as well as the reading of the girls supposedly secret diaries. the girls are betrayed, and the munich camp is in disarray. this is the work of a trickster called deuce, who sees himself as the successor to "hermes, loki, prometheus, raven and coyote". halloween made a clone of himself to watch his own life. he inserted this clone into ivr to follow his own life. however, the clone did not follow all of halloween's choices, and hal realized that the clone was an individual human being, and not really hal. he named the clone deuce and brought him out of ivr to raise him as his son. when deuce makes his strike on the munich computer network, pandora goes to michigan to confront halloween (she thinks he is responsible), which makes halloween initially mad. pandora agrees to take deuce back to munich to face a punishment. but penny, recently unbalanced by the news of the mood-suppressants, is secretly working with deuce, and the two elope. meanwhile, pandora is tracking monkeys in the amazon. the plague wiped out the world's primates, so the continued survival of the monkeys is important if a vaccine is to be found. an answer is found—a special sap the monkeys eat—but mu'tazz, a human boy on the expedition, suddenly falls ill and the groups goes back to munich for medical care. the answer is chilling—mu'tazz overdosed on his retrovirus tablets, and the retrovirus began to mutate. halloween goes to munich to track down his son. after brief recriminations, isaac—leader of the luxor camp—tells them that the three children on the exchange course (and presumably the other human children) are also suffering and will soon die. deuce and penelope go to britain, and begin a 'last-couple-on-earth' fantasy. but penny insists that on fulfilling the fantasy, and the pair go to an air force base and acquire weaponry. after they accidentally shoot down pandora over the mediterranean, they travel to munich with a rocket launcher. deuce follows everything penny tells him to do because she is dying—it's shown by huge red splotches on her. however, she is really using strawberry jam to cause herself to have an allergic reaction so that she can fool deuce. when penny tells deuce to fire the rocket launcher at the headquarters where everyone else is, deuce refuses. penny takes the rocket launcher herself and prepares to fire it. halloween shoots her. deuce commits suicide, with his idea of his father shattered. in the aftermath, the various leaders realise that all their problems came from deceit and trickery. they all move to munich, where they begin to build, hopefully, a better world. ||| 5 ||| 5
the novel begins with dreyfus being sent out on a routine assignment to lock down a glitter-band habitat for polling violations. his superiors send one of his deputies, thalia ng, to distribute software upgrades around the glitter band to prevent anyone from attempting a similar violation. in the meantime, dreyfus is sent to investigate the recent destruction of a habitat named ruskin-sartorious. analysis indicates that the habitat has been destroyed by the flame of a conjoiner drive, and dreyfus's team believe the lighthugger accompaniment of shadows, the only one to have been near the habitat in recent weeks, is responsible. before they can conclude their investigation, however, the ultranauts take justice into their own hands and destroy the ship, but not before dreyfus is able to converse with the captain, who convinces him that his crew were not responsible. believing him to be true, dreyfus and his deputy, the hyperpig sparver, decide to investigate the matter further. dreyfus and sparver interview digital backups of the inhabitants of ruskin-sartorious. dreyfus speaks with one of them about the clockmaker, an alien machine which formerly lived in a glitter band research centre, creating, as its name suggests, clocks, before it began a violent killing spree and was destroyed with nuclear weapons nine years prior to the novel. he and sparver then analyse communication records from the ruskin-sartorious habitat, and discover links with an orbiting asteroid owned by the nerval-lermontov family (a member of which is called aurora). they defeat its defence systems and penetrate inside, discovering a conjoiner starship trapped inside. one of them, clepsydra, has escaped and is hiding. she meets with dreyfus and tells him that she and the other conjoiners had been enslaved by aurora (now an extremely powerful software entity) to use the exordium to predict the future. the conjoiners predict a future devastated by what is implied to be the melding plague, and aurora has been planning to respond to stop it (use of the exordium creates a new timeline which can be changed to avoid the future the exordium describes). she and dreyfus escape as a ship under aurora's control arrives and destroys the habitat. at the same time, thalia has distributed the software upgrade to the required four habitats across the glitter band, but it appears to be malfunctioning; information access is shut down in the habitats she has visited, and servitors (service robots used across the glitter bands) are rounding up and exterminating civilians. she and some of the survivors of the last habitat take refuge in its polling core tower, barricading the entrance. outside, the servitors begin to construct "weevil" war machines using plans stolen by gaffney, a senior prefect secretly in alliance with aurora. back at panoply, clepsydra is taken into isolation, whilst dreyfus explains the situation to jane aumonier, the supreme prefect. unbeknownst to him, however, gaffney kills clepsydra and hides the corpse in dreyfus' quarters, which he uses to frame dreyfus. with dreyfus in custody, he manipulates the senior prefects into voting aumonier out of office. the prefects debate what to do about the emergence of the weevils, which have now left the four original habitats and are moving towards others. before very long, however, gaffney is exposed as the murderer of clepsydra when attempting to interrogate dreyfus. he admits to his role in the weevil outbreak and informs the prefects that aurora is responsible. aurora herself contacts panoply and demands that they stand down, claiming to be taking over the glitter band for its own good. aumonier, now back in power, refuses and orders panoply to ready for war. although thalia escapes from aurora's forces during a disastrous attack by panoply, simulations run by the prefects indicate that they have virtually no chance of success; the weevils are destroying habitats and converting them into even more weevils, grossly outnumbering the prefects. aumonier speaks to dreyfus and tells him that the aforementioned clockmaker was not actually destroyed nine years previously; part of it survived and was recovered by panoply. the ultra-secret panoply unit, firebrand, was established to research it. although aumonier ordered it shut down, she now believes its members relocated the clockmaker to ruskin-sartorious. as the clockmaker was the only intelligence in the glitter band capable of defeating aurora, she attempted to destroy it. dreyfus confronts members of firebrand, who confirm aumonier's theory, but reveal that the clockmaker was not in fact destroyed; firebrand became aware of the attack in advance and moved the clockmaker. following them to the surface of yellowstone, he and sparver fight their way into an abandoned american colony, where the clockmaker is being hidden. sparver leaves to fight gaffney, who is approaching the colony with bombs to destroy the clockmaker. dreyfus meets with the clockmaker, who reveals that he is actually philip lascaille, a character in revelation space who was believed to have committed suicide after meeting with the shrouders, but was in fact scanned to produce a simulation, which was sent back to the shrouders, who turned it into the clockmaker. dreyfus tells the clockmaker what is happening. it incapacitates him and leaves. regaining consciousness, dreyfus meets with sparver. they return to panoply to find that the weevil attack has collapsed; the clockmaker has uploaded itself into the glitter band's data network and is fighting a digital war with aurora. as such, she is unable to control the weevils effectively, and the prefects are destroying them in alliance with the ultras. dreyfus begins preparing to investigate the death of philip lascaille, having promised to the clockmaker to bring those responsible to justice. ||| 0 ||| 5

the events of the bastard prince span a period of approximately six months, from late may to late december of 928. the novel begins after the invasion of prince marek furstán-festil, the bastard child of the last deryni ruler of gwynedd, king imre, and his sister, princess ariella. supported by his torenthi relatives, marek has occupied the town of culliecairn and slain earl hrorik ii of eastmarch. word of the invasion is quickly sent to rhemuth, where king rhys michael haldane has spent the first six years of his reign as an imprisoned puppet of his lords of state. when a torenthi herald arrives at rhemuth to challenge the king, the great lords realize that they must permit rhys michael to go to eastmarch and personally respond to the invasion. disguised as one of queen michaela's serving maids, rhysel thuryn quickly learns of the king's plans to accompany his army to eastmarch. rhysel meets with members of the camberian council and attempts to convince them to activate the king's haldane potential before he leaves the following day. despite his own objections, father joram macrorie, rhysel's uncle, eventually agrees to her plan. that night, joram and tieg thuryn, rhysel's brother, infiltrate the castle and meet with the king. tieg unblocks the deryni powers of both michaela and her brother, sir cathan drummond, and michaela then assists tieg, rhysel, and joram in activating rhys michael's arcane powers. after the ritual, joram and tieg capture master dimitri, a torenthi deryni collaborator who has been working for the great lords. the camberian council alters dimitri's mind with their own set of commands before returning him to rhemuth. the next day, rhys michael departs the capital with army, accompanied by cathan, earl manfred macinnis, earl rhun von horthy, lord albertus, and father paulin sinclair. before departing the city, constable udaut is killed when dimitri secretly uses his powers to spook udaut's horse. later on the journey, a swarm of bees mysteriously attacks the royal party and nearly kills albertus. several days later, albertus questions rhys michael about the incidents, concerned about the rumored magical powers of the haldane family. he orders dimitri to probe the king's mind, but the deryni is still under the compulsions of the camberian council. to protect the king, dimitri kills albertus and later allows himself to be implicated in the death. when paulin attempts to confine dimitri, he lashes out with his powers and destroys paulin's mind before be overcome. dimitri is tortured for several hours before he is killed by a mental death-trigger in his own mind. the royal army arrives at lochalyn the next day, where it is joined by the levies of duke graham of claibourne, earl sighere of marley, and earl corban howell of eastmarch. in a private conversation, lady sudrey, hrorik's deryni widow, offers rhys michael her support and the use of her limited powers. the following morning, rhys michael agrees to meet with prince miklos of torenth, who claims to have led the invasion on marek's behalf. accompanied by sudrey, the king parleys with miklos briefly, but miklos breaks the peace by attacking sudrey. rhys michael uses his own powers to protect himself and kill miklos, but sudrey is killed in the battle and rhys michael is wounded when a horse steps on his hand. afterwards, the king claims that it was sudrey who used magic in the battle, and later realizes that miklos' companion was actually marek himself. after miklos' death, marek withdraws his forces and returns to torenth. rhys michael asks the northern lords to help him break free of the great lords, and graham and sighere agree to become regents for the king's son, prince owain, if anything should happen to the king. cathan prepares a codicil to the king's will, and all parties involved succeed in signing it without alerting rhun or manfred. the king departs for rhemuth the next day, but the progress of the army is slowed by the worsening condition of his injury. the army is eventually forced to stop at saint ostrythe's convent when the king becomes too ill to continue. dom queron kinevan rushes to the king's side, but he does not arrive in time and rhys michael soon dies from poor medical treatment. as the army returns to rhemuth with rhys michael's body, the camberian council informs the northern lords of the king's death and offers their assistance in securing the rights of the new regents. in rhemuth, cathan is drugged and imprisoned, but michaela and rhysel succeed in activating owain's haldane potential. over the next several days, the northern lords ride toward rhemuth, eventually arriving on the morning of rhys michael's funeral. accompanied by queron, tieg, ansel macrorie, and a band of armed men, graham and sighere confront the great lords inside the royal tomb. rhun kills manfred and flees with owain, while earl tammaron takes michaela hostage. as cathan pursues rhun, michaela uses her powers to slay tammaron. cathan catches rhun atop a tower and the two engage in a brief fight before rhun is killed. several months later, michaela visits her husband's tomb in the royal crypt. owain has been crowned as king of gwynedd, and cathan now serves on the regency council with her, graham, and sighere. of the former regents, only former archbishop hubert macinnis remains alive, but he has been stripped of his office and imprisoned for his crimes. although he did not live long enough to see it, rhys michael's actions succeeded in freeing the crown of gwynedd for his heirs. ||| 2

the search for snout picks up where the previous book left off. introducing the crew of the galactic patrol vessel ferkel to his earthling mother proves to be as difficult as predicted, and explaining that he's going with them to find his semi-alien father is an even harder task. but the real trouble starts when they find out that bkr (the pain-loving alien psycho antagonist) is on the loose, having taken control of the ferkel's sister ship merkel while the ship was delivering him to prison. the crew of the ferkel has been ordered to seek out their enemy and recapture him. after they question smorkus flinders (a muscle-bound alien from dimension x) and learn something of bkr's current plan, rod is contacted again by his friend snout, master of the mental arts. partly inspired by this contact, grakker (the ship's commander) decides to break off from the galactic patrol and head for the mentat instead, the school where snout became a master of the mental arts (incidentally, the building is one big plant). there, he hopes to find a clue that could lead them to their fallen friend. during the journey, grakker reveals some of his past, including how he got to know both snout and bkr. smorkus flinders, having escaped from his suspended animation pod, manages to capture the entire crew... except for elspeth (rod's all-human cousin), who stowed away and was also in suspended animation as punishment. she manages to stop smorkus and rescue the others. also as a result of the battle, rod's chibling (a small furball from dimension x) is injured from being thrown into a wall. later that night, rod learns that his friend was forced into his third stage of life: a two-part animal. the first half, which is then named seymour, resembles a squashed, hairless blue cat with four (later six) legs, a long tail, and a similar neck with a gigantic eyeball at one end. the other half is named edgar, and looks the same as before. while both appear to have separate minds, seymour is the half that is truly sentient, holding their shared brain in his body. soon after, they arrive at the mentat and meet with the 'head' council, who are unable to help. however, they do reveal that all the messages which came from snout are, in part, due to a direct link between rod's mind and snout's, created by an incident involving direct brain-to-brain training in the first book. they also question smorkus flinders, and through him contact bkr. though they cannot help in regard to the ferkada that snout mentioned, they do agree to try and cure smorkus flinders, reverting him from a monster to a normal (the species he used to be until he was caught in a nasty reality quake and turned into a monster). later that day, the mentat's security force (led by an insectoid woman named arly bung) arrests rod, elspeth and the crew after being contacted by the galactic patrol. imprisoned in the lowest regions of the mentat, they are soon rescued by selima khan, another of snout's kind who also attended the mentat in his year. during their escape into the caves below the mentat, rod sees an ancient carving of his father. selima khan also reveals the plans of bkr and smorkus flinders: they intend to use a black hole to detonate a bomb that will disrupt the space-time continuum and eventually bring the flow of time itself to a complete stop, but require rod's brain to do so, for an unknown reason. later, he is contacted again and leaves the group to follow the message. along with seymour and edgar, rod winds up in the belly of a gigantic stone beast, and the trio journey deep into its bowels. finally, they reach a chamber where snout is laying, fading away into nothingness. but he is not alone, as rod is reunited with his father (alias the ferkada, one of the ancient founders of the mentat) at last. rod's father (ah-rit alber ite, or arthur "art" allbright) reveals the truth about where he came from (the lost civilization of atlantis, circa 35,000 years ago), and his personal history with bkr. he also reveals that he once fled with the crucial bit of information that bkr needs for his current plans and stored them in a safe place: rod's brain. during this last part, bkr arrives with smorkus flinders, revealing part of his side of the story. he also arrives to get the information that he needs. just in time, the ferkel arrives as well, and the resulting battle ends with a stalemate: bkr has ah-rit in his grasp, and threatens to kill him if rod (and the crucial information) aren't handed over to him. fortunately, there's a solution. ah-rit is released to the ferkel, while rod is handed over to bkr, and snout transfers the contents of rod's mind (including the crucial information) into seymour, resulting in two minds living in one body. after the swap, bkr leaves with rod's body. afterward, snout (now fully recovered from his coma-like state) reveals exactly what happened to him after he vanished from dimension x. he was probing the dimension for something, and connected with something extenuatingly hostile, possibly smorkus flinders himself. ||| 0 ||| 2
the book continues shortly after the previous installment left off, skipping only severian's journey from the gate of nessus to the nearby town of saltus. having been separated from the rest of the group he was traveling with, severian pauses his search for them here as he is given an opportunity to practice his art (in this case, execution) on two people. the first was found to be a servant of vodalus, a revolutionary and traitor to the commonwealth. as the man is dragged out of his home by a mob, severian glimpses agia in the crowd, a woman who with her twin brother had tried to swindle and then kill severian to get his priceless executioner's sword. severian executed the brother at the request of the local authorities. severian searches for her at the town fair but instead has a conversation with a man whose skin is green, held prisoner in a tent as a sideshow attraction. the green man tells severian he is from the future. severian takes pity on him and gives him a piece of his whetstone so that he can free himself by grinding through his chains, thus recalling his mercy to thecla, another prisoner, in the first book. he does not find agia and instead returns to town where he later executes a woman accused of being a witch. eating dinner with his friend jonas (whom he met at the gate at nessus) that evening, he finds a letter from thecla asking him to meet her at a nearby cave. in the cave, severian encounters and barely escapes a group of man-apes. the light from the claw (a relic he accidentally had come into the possession of, which had previously been held by a religious order) stops the man-apes' attack, but it also seems to wake an unknown creature somewhere in the cave, who is only heard and not seen. severian has little time to ponder this as he escapes, only to be attacked by agia and her assassins outside the cave. one of the attackers is killed by one of the man-apes, who had its hand cut off in the battle. when severian brings out the claw its wound is healed. severian lets agia go and returns to saltus, where he and jonas are taken by vodalus. vodalus recalls that severian saved his life and allows severian to enter his service. severian and jonas attend a dinner with vodalus where they consume the dead thecla's flesh, which, when combined with an alien substance, allows thecla's memories to live within severian. given the task to deliver a message to a servant in the house absolute, the autarch's seat of power, severian and jonas set off to the north. they are attacked by a flying creature who feeds on the heat and life force of living beings, and barely escape. a nearby soldier patrolling the area is killed by the creature (now divided into three separate individuals after being cut by severian's sword), but is then revived by the claw. they are then captured by guards of the house absolute and thrown into an antechamber designed to hold prisoners indefinitely. severian's claw heals a wound jonas receives during the night they spend there; then the pair escape some unknown horror using a pass phrase to open a secret door—severian remembers the phrase using thecla's memory within him. walking the corridors of house absolute, jonas is revealed to be a robot who once crash landed on earth and is now partly covered by human flesh, and steps into a mirror and disappears, promising to return for jolenta when he is healed. severian is lost and eventually encounters the autarch himself, to whom he swears service, upon being shown a portal to another universe. stumbling into the gardens of the house absolute, severian is reunited with dorcas, dr. talos, and baldanders, who are preparing to once again perform the play they put on in nessus in the first book. severian participates again, but the play is cut short as baldanders flies into a rage and attacks the audience, revealing that aliens are among them. the band is scattered and severian finds them a ways away the next morning, heading north. talos and baldanders part ways with severian and dorcas at a crossroad, severian heading toward thrax and the giant and his physician headed toward lake diaturna. the waitress jolenta tries to have talos take her with him, but he has no more use for her now that the plays were no longer necessary, and severian is forced to take her. as they head north, jolenta is attacked by a "blood bat" and becomes ill. it is revealed that she had been scientifically altered by dr. talos to be gorgeous and desirable, but is quickly becoming sickly and unattractive. soon the trio meets an old farmer who tells them they must pass through an enigmatic stone city to get to thrax. upon arriving at the ruinous city, severian sees a pair of witches initiate a dream-like event in which ghostly dancers of the stone town's past fill the area and engage with the witch's' servant, who is actually vodalus's lieutenant hildegrin. the book ends with dorcas and severian emerging from a stupor in the stone town, jolenta dead and the witches and hildegrin gone. ||| 5 ||| 2
revelation space starts off with three seemingly unrelated narrative strands that eventually meet—and merge—as the novel progresses. this plot device is characteristic of many of reynolds's works. the book opens in the year 2551 on resurgam, a planet considered a backwater on the edge of colonized human space. dan sylveste, an archaeologist, leader of the colony, and wealthy scion of a prominent scientific family, leads a team excavating the remains of the amarantin, a long-dead, 900,000-year-old civilization that once existed on resurgam. as a violent dust storm threatens to temporarily shut down the excavation, sylveste discovers new evidence that the entire amarantin race achieved a much higher level of technological sophistication than was previously known, before they were wiped out in a single mysterious cataclysm. next, the book jumps back to 2540, where most of the crew of the starship nostalgia for infinity are frozen for the journey to yellowstone (in the epsilon eridani system) in order to find sylveste. because information is often decades old by the time it reaches other human settlements in a universe without faster-than-light travel, the crew does not realize it has been more than 15 years since sylveste left yellowstone to pursue archaeological work on resurgam. the nostalgia for infinity is an ancient ship that once carried hundreds of thousands, but now its crew is only a handful of ultras—highly modified humans adapted to the rigors of long interstellar spaceflight. and they're desperate to find sylveste because their captain has been infected with the melding plague, a virus that attacks human cells and machine nanotechnology in equal measure, perverting them into grotesque combinations. it's believed that only the technological expertise of the sylveste family can help cure the captain. meanwhile, in 2524 in chasm city, yellowstone, professional assassin ana khouri is hired by a mysterious figure known as the mademoiselle to infiltrate the crew of the nostalgia for infinity as it reaches orbit around yellowstone. khouri's new employer knows the ship will follow sylveste to the edge of human space in an attempt to find a cure for its captain, and gives khouri explicit orders to kill sylveste once the nostalgia for infinitys crew have found him. using subterfuge, this new employer is able to arrange a meeting twenty years later between khouri and one of the ship's triumvirs, ilia volyova, making it appear as though the meeting happened by chance. in 2566, after khouri has successfully infiltrated the crew of the nostalgia for infinity as the ship's new gunnery officer, the ship arrives in orbit around resurgam. desperate to secure sylveste's expertise to help cure their captain, triumvirs volyova, sajaki and hegazi demand the fledgling resurgam civilisation turn sylveste over to them. when the government of the small human colony baulks, volyova reminds them of the power at the disposal of her massive ship by apparently wiping out one of the planet's settlements with a single discharge of the infinitys weapons. fearing the consequences of defying the ultras for a second time, and knowing full well the starship is capable of destroying all human life on the planet, resurgam's government hands over sylveste, who travels to orbit accompanied by his wife, pascale. once aboard, however, sylveste turns the tables—he informs the triumvirs that he has antimatter bombs hidden inside the implants in his artificial eyes. a detonation from one of those anti-matter bombs would be enough to destroy the nostalgia for infinity. emboldened, sylveste makes a deal with the crew—he will attempt to cure their captain in exchange for them using their ship to bring him closer to cerberus, a planet near resurgam that carried particular significance for the amarantin civilisation. as sylveste and the crew of the nostalgia for infinity approach cerberus, sylveste realizes the massive celestial body isn't a planet at all—but rather, a massive technological beacon, aimed at alerting machine sentience to the appearance of new star-faring cultures. it is this beacon, sylveste belatedly realises, that alerted a machine intelligence known as the inhibitors to the presence of the amarantin, and ultimately caused the demise of that race. the beacon begins to activate and sylveste detonates the bombs in his eyes to destroy the facility. ||| 2 ||| 5
the bishop's heir details the events of a period of time lasting roughly a month and a half, beginning in late november 1123 and ending in early january 1124. the novel begins as the curia of bishops meets in culdi to choose the successor to the deceased bishop of meara. the selection of the next bishop is a delicate matter, as the mearans have made several attempts to secede from gwynedd over the past century. king kelson haldane addresses the assembled clerics, then departs to make a survey of the local barons. shortly thereafter, kelson is reunited with lord dhugal macardry, an old friend who he has not seen since before his coronation, and the king decides to visit dhugal's father, earl caulay macardry of transha. while visiting transha, kelson learns more about princess caitrin quinnell, the mearan pretender. descended from the ancient line of mearan rules, caitrin is determined to establish herself as queen of a free and independent meara, a land which has been ruled by gwynedd for over a century. however, kelson is forced to return to culdi after duke alaric morgan contacts him and informs him that duncan mclain has been attacked and wounded. upon returning to culdi, kelson acknowledges the election of bishop henry istelyn, who has been chosen as the new bishop of meara. shortly after kelson returns to his capital of rhemuth, dhugal is captured while attempting to stop the escape of edmund loris, the former archbishop of valoret who was imprisoned for his past treason. loris takes dhugal to the mearan city of ratharkin, where he places both dhugal and istelyn in confinement. when the news of loris' escape and dhugal's capture reaches kelson, the king decides to make a daring winter raid on ratharkin. caitrin arrives in ratharkin, accompanied by her children and her husband, dhugal's uncle sicard macardry. although istelyn refuses to assist loris and caitrin in their treason, dhugal pretends to agree, hoping to find a way to warn kelson. he eventually manages to escape ratharkin, taking his cousin sidana prisoner as he flees. dhugal is rescued by kelson's approaching forces, and sidana's younger brother, llewell, is also captured. kelson gives sicard until christmas to surrender loris, then returns to rhemuth with caitrin's two youngest children as hostages. upon returning to rhemuth, kelson eventually bows to the pressure of his advisors and agrees to marry sidana if her mother refuses to surrender, hoping to avert open rebellion by joining the two royal lines. a short time later, when duncan is consecrated a bishop, the power of the ceremony nearly overwhelms dhugal, who possesses mental shields that no human should have. when christmas finally arrives, caitrin's messenger brings istelyn's severed head to court, openly defying the orders of the king. although reluctant to marry a girl he barely knows and who has been raised to hate him, kelson nevertheless follows through on his promise and asks sidana to marry him. sidana reluctantly agrees, but llewell is furious at the possibility of his sister marrying his enemy. two weeks of preparations ensue, during which time both kelson and sidana try to adjust to the realities of their approaching nuptials. on the morning of the wedding, duncan recognizes a cloak clasp that dhugal is wearing, which is the same clasp that duncan gave his wife many years ago. duncan tells the tale of his unusual marriage to dhugal's mother, and morgan uses his powers to confirm that duncan is dhugal's natural father. realizing that he is part-deryni, dhugal is finally able to lower his shields, and father and son quickly exchange memories of their lives during their time apart. a short time later, kelson and sidana ride through rhemuth to the castle, where the entire court waits to witness the marriage of their king and their new queen. kelson and sidana exchange their vows as man and wife, but the ceremony is suddenly interrupted when llewell slashes his sister's throat, making a final desperate attempt to prevent the wedding. morgan and duncan frantically try to save sidana, but she dies almost instantly. stunned and horrified, kelson can do nothing but hold the body of his dead bride and weep. ||| 2 ||| 2
the story opens with the main characters nadia santos and alexander cold being on safari in kenya and accompanying alex's grandmother kate, who works as a reporter for the magazine international geographic. at a certain point in their stopover, they visit a market where a seer tells them to stay close to each other if they want to avoid danger. soon afterwards, the team is joined by a roman catholic missionary who introduces himself as brother fernando. the clergyman asks the crew to fly him to ngoubé, a village situated deep inside the african jungle. two of his friars, who had previously moved into the village to look after the heavily disadvantaged population, have recently sent him a letter telling him about the villagers' disastrous conditions and their constantly worsening situation. their deteriorating state is due to the two rulers of the village, who, alongside the mysterious and powerful sorcerer sombe, cruelly torment the villagers and are not fond at all of the friars' presence. despite some arguments arising between brother fernando and the seductive african pilot angie ninderera, kate and the others agree to come along with the priest and help him find the friars. angie reluctantly agrees to fly the crew to the village's whereabouts. upon landing, angie's plane gets broken by crashing onto a small beach, therefore isolating them from the outside world. several days later, the crew is found by some fishermen who grudgingly guide them to the entrance of a forest which, according to them, belongs to a very dangerous and tyrannical king called kosongo. he brutally usurped the command of ngoubé some time earlier - causing the former queen nana-asanta to disappear - and terrorizes its population, availing himself of his two assistants, a mysterious sorcerer called sombe and the commandant maurice mbembelé, with both of them being notorious for their cruelty and cold-bloodedness. once the crew has arrived in the village and been taken to kosonge, they masquerade as reporters who want to interview kosongo about his allegedly world-renowned wisdom and supernatural skills. kosongo finally orders the crew to spend the rest of the day in an unfurnished hut surrounded by soldiers watching them. over the course of the following nights, nadia explorates the village on her own and discovers that the villagers' wives are forced to spend the nights imprisoned in a couple of barracks. after some difficulties in terms of communication and understanding, she manages to gain the women's support, who too suffer from the horrible tyranny, having been separated from their husbands and sons. the commandant mbembelé actually forces those ones to become brainwashed soldiers and obliges them to spy on their own families. alex and nadia eventually escape into the forest to search for the pygmies and convince them of rebelling against kosongo and mbembelé. they furthermore come across the village's former queen nana-asante, who agrees to support them as well. the pygmies eventually leave the wood and turn up in the village. one of their leaders challenges mbembelé to a duel. thanks to his agility and rapidity he finally exhausts the commandant, who is subsequently chased away by alexander himself in the shape of a giant black jaguar. shortly after mbembelé's getaway, the terrifying sorcerer sombe shows up in the village, his terrifying appearance smashing the villagers' resistance at once. nadia, who has meanwhile stayed in the forest, arrives in the village in the shape of a white eagle, accompanied by nana-asante and many other people equipped with magical powers whom nadia and alex had met during their former journeys, each of them being narrated in the two previous volumes of allende's trilogy. at the end of the battle, when sombe has to face his imminent failure, angie rips his mask off, and mbembelé, sombe and kosongo turn out to be the same person. the man is thrown into a waterhole full of crocodiles. brother fernando decides to stay in the village and help the population restore their existence. angie ninderera succeeds in contacting a friend of hers, who promises to pick up the crew by means of a helicopter. the epilogue is set two years after alex's and nadia's adventure in the african jungle. alex has graduated from school and begun to study medicine at berkeley. he has finally managed to persuade nadia into attending university in the united states. alex has just flown to new york city, where kate and nadia share an apartment. alex wants to take nadia to a graduation ceremony. kate has written three books about their adventures which she now shows to her grandson. ||| 0 ||| 2

the narrative focuses on the journey of the two main characters from adolescence to adulthood in two alternate worlds, the real world and the idyllic tembreabrezi. the story is told in alternating chapters from two starkly alternating viewpoints: that of irene pannis, and of hugh rogers. they live in the suburbs of an unnamed us city, in difficult circumstances and with troubled families. they independently discover a place hidden in a local wood, where time flows much more slowly than in the outside world and it is always evening, a "threshold" between their own world and another; though hugh finds it first within the story, irene has already been visiting the other world for some years. she has another life there in the town of tembreabrezi, an adoptive family of sorts, and has learned the local language. both irene and hugh love the "beginning place", the threshold; they feel a sense of belonging and home there that they lack elsewhere in their lives. as hugh stumbles upon the beginning place, irene discovers that something is wrong in tembreabrezi; the paths which connect the town with the rest of the country are closed somehow, and no one can reach or leave the town except for her. the closing is not material but emotional; the townsfolk are struck by a desperate fear which will not allow them to move beyond the town limits. despite her anger with hugh, and her resentment of his disturbance of her hidden sanctuary, they find that they must work together; she has had increasing trouble in passing through the gateway into the other place, while he cannot always cross back into the 'real' world. by travelling together they can pass back and forth through the gateway at will, and so they return to tembreabrezi together. hugh is welcomed in the town as the hero for whom they have waited; irene is jealous, wanting desperately to win the admiration and respect of the townsfolk and especially the mayor or master, sark, whom she has loved for a long time. hugh is largely unaware of her feelings, but wants to complete the quest to become worthy of the lord of the manor's daughter allia. in the end, they embark together on a mission to save the town and reopen the roads. together they track down the monster that brings the fear and hugh kills it. he is injured in the fight, but irene helps him to keep going until they can reach the gateway back to their own world. on the other side, the trust and the love they have discovered together opens a different sort of gateway, providing them with a possible future together that avoids the destructive patterns of their own families. ||| 2 ||| 2

the novel features scenes and events including the discovery of a near-dead alien in the desert, who clearly says in english, "i'm sorry, but there is bad news," and this alien's subsequent interrogation and autopsy; the discovery of an artificial geological formation and its subsequent nuclear destruction by a desperate military; and the earth's eventual destruction by the mutual annihilation of a piece of neutronium and a piece of antineutronium dropped into earth's core. there is another alien faction at work, however, represented on earth by small spider-like robots that recruit human agents through some form of mind control. they frantically collect all the human data, biological records, tissue samples, seeds, and dna from the biosphere that they can, and evacuate a handful of people from earth. in space, this faction's machines combat and eventually destroy the attackers, though not before earth's fate is sealed. the evacuees eventually settle a newly terraformed mars while some form the crew of a ship of the law to hunt down the home world of the killers, a quest described in the sequel, anvil of stars. one of the point of view characters is arthur gordon, a scientist who, with his wife francine and son martin is among those rescued from the destruction of earth. some other characters are close to an american president who fails to take action against the threat. the two books show at least one solution to the fermi paradox, with electromagnetically noisy civilisations being snuffed out by the arrival of self-replicating machines designed to destroy any potential threat to their (possibly long-dead) creators. (a similar theme is explored in fred saberhagen's berserker novels.) ||| 5 ||| 5
enoch wallace, an american civil war veteran, is chosen by an alien called ulysses to administer a way station for interplanetary travel. wallace is the only human being who knows of the existence of these aliens, until almost a hundred years later, when the us government becomes aware of and suspicious about his failure to age or die. factions in the galactic federation want to close off development of earth's entire arm of the galaxy to concentrate resources elsewhere, and the government's stealing the body of a dead alien gives them impetus to push forward, while the loss of an artifact giving contact with the spirit of the universe causes galactic civilization to begin to fray. the novel has a number of seemingly disconnected subplots that are not resolved until the conclusion of the book. one such subplot is related to the fact that the government is very interested in enoch and spies on him for an indeterminate time. enoch's closest neighbors are an asocial and coarse hillbilly family whose daughter is a deaf mute. she heals warts, birds and butterflies and is the total antithesis of her clan. by adopting an alien math, enoch is able to compute that the world will go to war and eventual nuclear suicide. strangely, enoch has a gun he never uses except in an elaborate hunting simulation. enoch's ghostly support system, which he created years ago, collapses on him during the course of the novel. finally, enoch is left with the choice of allowing the earth to destroy itself in war or call down a galaxy sponsored "dumbing down" that would last for generations but avert the looming war. ||| 5 ||| 5

restore eldwist, freeing it from its stone shell. at quickening's request, walker releases her, and she falls from the cliff and disintegrates. the dust of quickening's body settles over eldwist, and

the novel opens in 1999 with a car accident occurring in parallel universes. in universe a, the universe in which hendrix's previous novel better angels occurs, the accident is avoided allowing 3 of the major characters in that novel to be born. however in universe a prime the accident does occur and the resulting deaths prevent those characters from being born. the 3 characters are brothers jiro and seiji ansel yamaguchi, and their cousin john drinan. years later in 2032 the process of jiro's transcendence, which occurs at the end of better angels, results in john being thrown from universe a to universe a prime. empty cities of the full moon takes place in universe a prime after this. when john is thrown between universes he quickly discovers that there is no record of his existence. the trauma of this event causes john to lose himself in depression. after meeting mark fornash, john en-rolls himself in a clinical trial of an experimental artificial prion based cure for mental illness, created by tomoko fukuda. soon a drumming and dancing mania begins to sweep the globe, causing a large and increasing portion of the population to drop out of their societies. due to his interest in shamanism mark fornash is the first person to recognize the manias as a single phenomenon patterned after shamanistic practises, and to predict it progression from drumming and dancing to visions, shape-shifting, soul-flying and death. the story follows the progress of the disease through the view points of these characters, as well as: simon lingham, ex-husband of tokomo, and world health organization investigator; sister vena, a nun in calcuta who observes extreme stigmata in patients in last stages of the pandemic; leira losaba, a police lieutenant in johannesburg who investigates a series of murders involving shape-shifted people; cameron spires, one of the survivors of the car accident at the beginning of the novel, an eccentric billionaire with interests in human longevity and long-term survival. as the pandemic progresses cameron eventually organizes a conference to pool research, which brings all of the major character together. the pandemic appears to be related to the tokomo's prion's, but the extreme effects can not be explained. as madness and death consume the world, cameron uses his enormous wealth to create a bolt-hole in the bahamas and to bring all of the major characters to safety. however, before cameron departs to his island he holds a final tele-conference with some powerful allies, who have died but been recorded in a powerful computer system. this system is the "gödelian non-standard optimized market evolution systems" or gnomes. this organization tetragammaton and these characters (dr. vang, michael dalke, and martin kong) have appeared in previous hendrix novels involved in the long-term survival of humanity through the creation of mind-machine interfaces. this conversation reveals that tetragammaton, was involved in the creation of the pandemic but that it has gone out of control. dalke and kong claim that the gnomes were ultimately responsible for creating the pandemic as a complete defence against extinction and by orders of mysterious entity the allesseh. the allesseh is a massive consciousness at the centre of the galaxy, described in hendrix's novel better angels. the pandemic has resulted in the near-extinction of humanity. some of the survivors where fully resistant to the pandemic and have remained human, called oldfolk or urfolk, and some were partially resistant have become werfolk having some of the madness, drumming, dancing, and shape shifting of the pandemic. over the past 30 years cameron spires has perfected a longevity treatment, created a dolphin-human hybrid species called the merfolk, kept the islands strictly isolated from the werfolk, prevented further research into the pandemic and maintained himself as the unquestioned 'founder-ruler'. this has driven all of the major characters, except simon lingham, back to the mainland in search of answers. simon lingham, leaves for the same reasons soon after the story begins. cameron's granddaughter trillia spires and her lover ricardo, soon follow him when ricardo is found to have signs of the plague, and exiled per cameron's rules. they hope to catch up with simon in new york city and to discover a cure for ricardo. their journey takes them up the american east coast, encountering all of the major characters of the novel who are each dealing with the post-pandemic world in their owns ways. each character, except leire who has become a werfolk-hating warlord, either joins the group or offers some aid. by the time the group reaches new york, ricardo's symptoms are entering the final stages of the pandemic. ricardo's plague induced vision lead them to where simon has connected himself to gnomes. simon is learning from and changing the gnomes. he reveals cameron's involvement in not preventing the plague, and cameron arrives with a security team, claiming that he engineered the plague so that he could re-make humanity in his image. however, ricardo dies and transcends during this conflict preparing the way for john to return to his universe and transmitting full knowledge of the works of the pandemic to every human on the planet. this final knowledge will allow the three types of human, urfolk, werfolk, and merfolk, to choose their own destinies and control the effects of the pandemic. the group exiles cameron and returns to the bahamas to begin the process of re-building their world. ||| 5 ||| 5

the work outlines augustine's sinful youth and his conversion to christianity. it is widely seen as the first western autobiography ever written, and was an influential model for christian writers throughout the following 1000 years of the middle ages. it is not a complete autobiography, as it was written in his early 40s, and he lived long afterwards, producing another important work (city of god); it does, nonetheless, provide an unbroken record of his development of thought and is the most complete record of any single person from the 4th and 5th centuries. it is a significant theological work. in the work st. augustine writes about how much he regrets having led a sinful and immoral life. he discusses his regrets for following the manichaean religion and believing in astrology. he writes about nebridius's role in helping to persuade him that astrology was not only incorrect but evil, and st. ambrose's role in his conversion to christianity. the first nine books are autobiographical and the last four are commentary. he shows intense sorrow for his sexual sins, and writes on the importance of sexual morality. the books were written as prayers to god, thus the title, based on the psalms of david; and it begins with "for thou has made us for thyself and our hearts are restless till they rest in thee" . the work is thought to be divisible into books which symbolize various aspects of the trinity and trinitarian belief. ||| 4 ||| 4

the feminine mystique begins with an introduction describing what friedan called "the problem that has no name"—the widespread unhappiness of women in the 1950s and early 1960s. it discusses the lives of several housewives from around the united states who were unhappy despite living in material comfort and being happily married with fine children. chapter 1: friedan points out that the average age of marriage was dropping and the birthrate was increasing for women throughout the 1950s, yet the widespread unhappiness of women persisted, although american culture insisted that fulfillment for women could be found in marriage and housewifery; this chapter concludes by declaring "we can no longer ignore that voice within women that says: 'i want something more than my husband and my children and my home.'" chapter 2: friedan shows that the editorial decisions concerning women's magazines were being made mostly by men, who insisted on stories and articles that showed women as either happy housewives or unhappy, neurotic careerists, thus creating the "feminine mystique"—the idea that women were naturally fulfilled by devoting their lives to being housewives and mothers. friedan notes that this is in contrast to the 1930s, at which time women's magazines often featured confident and independent heroines, many of whom were involved in careers. chapter 3: friedan recalls her own decision to conform to society's expectations by giving up her promising career in psychology to raise children, and shows that other young women still struggled with the same kind of decision. many women dropped out of school early to marry, afraid that if they waited too long or became too educated, they would not be able to attract a husband. chapter 4: friedan discusses early american feminists and how they fought against the assumption that the proper role of a woman was to be solely a wife and mother. she notes that they secured important rights for women, including education, the right to pursue a career, and the right to vote. chapter 5: friedan, who had a degree in psychology, criticizes sigmund freud (whose ideas were very influential in america at the time of her book's publication). she notes that freud saw women as childlike and as destined to be housewives, once pointing out that freud wrote, "i believe that all reforming action in law and education would break down in front of the fact that, long before the age at which a man can earn a position in society, nature has determined woman’s destiny through beauty, charm, and sweetness. law and custom have much to give women that has been withheld from them, but the position of women will surely be what it is: in youth an adored darling and in mature years a loved wife." friedan also points out that freud's unproven concept of "penis envy" had been used to label women who wanted careers as neurotic, and that the popularity of freud's work and ideas elevated the "feminine mystique" of female fulfillment in housewifery into a "scientific religion" that most women were not educated enough to criticize. chapter 6: friedan criticizes functionalism, which attempted to make the social sciences more credible by studying the institutions of society as if they were parts of a social body, as in biology. institutions were studied in terms of their function in society, and women were confined to their sexual biological roles as housewives and mothers and told that doing otherwise would upset the social balance. friedan points out that this is unproven and that margaret mead, a prominent functionalist, had a flourishing career as an anthropologist. chapter 7: friedan discusses the change in women's education from the 1940s to the early 1960s, in which many women's schools concentrated on non-challenging classes that focused mostly on marriage, family, and other subjects deemed suitable for women, as educators influenced by functionalism felt that too much education would spoil women's femininity and capacity for sexual fulfillment. friedan says that this change in education arrested girls in their emotional development at a young age, because they never had to face the painful identity crisis and subsequent maturation that comes from dealing with many adult challenges. chapter 8: friedan notes that the uncertainties and fears during world war ii and the cold war made americans long for the comfort of home, so they tried to create an idealized home life with father as the breadwinner and mother as the housewife. friedan notes that this was helped along by the fact that many of the women who worked during the war filling jobs previously filled by men faced dismissal, discrimination, or hostility when the men returned, and that educators blamed over-educated, career-focused mothers for the maladjustment of soldiers in world war ii. yet as friedan shows, later studies found that overbearing mothers, not careerists, were the ones who raised maladjusted children. chapter 9: friedan shows that advertisers tried to encourage housewives to think of themselves as professionals who needed many specialized products in order to do their jobs, while discouraging housewives from having actual careers, since that would mean they would not spend as much time and effort on housework and therefore would not buy as many household products, cutting into advertisers' profits. chapter 10: friedan interviews several full-time housewives, finding that although they are not fulfilled by their housework, they are all extremely busy with it. she postulates that these women unconsciously stretch their home duties to fill the time available, because the feminine mystique has taught women that this is their role, and if they ever complete their tasks they will become unneeded. chapter 11: friedan notes that many housewives have sought fulfillment in sex, unable to find it in housework and children; friedan notes that sex cannot fulfill all of a person's needs, and that attempts to make it do so often drive married women to have affairs or drive their husbands away as they become obsessed with sex. chapter 12: friedan discusses the fact that many children have lost interest in life or emotional growth, attributing the change to the mother's own lack of fulfillment, a side effect of the feminine mystique. when the mother lacks a self, friedan notes, she often tries to live through her children, causing the children to lose their own sense of themselves as separate human beings with their own lives. chapter 13: friedan discusses abraham maslow's hierarchy of needs and notes that women have been trapped at the basic, physiological level, expected to find their identity through their sexual role alone. friedan says that women need meaningful work just as men do to achieve self-actualization, the highest level on the hierarchy of needs. chapter 14: in the final chapter of the feminine mystique, friedan discusses several case studies of women who have begun to go against the feminine mystique. she also advocates a new life plan for her women readers, including not viewing housework as a career, not trying to find total fulfillment through marriage and motherhood alone, and finding meaningful work that uses their full mental capacity. she discusses the conflicts that some women may face in this journey to self-actualization, including their own fears and resistance from others. for each conflict, friedan offers examples of women who have overcome it. friedan ends her book by promoting education and meaningful work as the ultimate method by which american women can avoid becoming trapped in the feminine mystique, calling for a drastic rethinking of what it means to be feminine, and offering several educational and occupational suggestions. ||| 4 ||| 4
before leaving work one afternoon, billy coleman spots a redbone coonhound in a fight with neighborhood dogs. he chases the other dogs away and helps it recover from its wounds. when it is feeling stronger again, he realizes he must set it free, knowing that it will find its way home. this event makes him revisit his past, and the two redbone coonhounds he had taken care of when he was a boy in the ozarks. growing up in the ozarks with his parents and three younger sisters, billy coleman, at age 10, wants to own a pair of redbone coonhounds but his parents tell him that they can't afford them. one day he finds an article in a sportsman magazine offering a pair in kentucky for $25 each. he decides to earn the money himself. for two years, he works many different jobs, and manages to save $50. his grandfather writes to the kennel and finds out that the dogs have dropped in price by $5 each. he sends for two redbone coonhound puppies. the mail does not deliver packages, and so the puppies have to be sent to the depot at tahlequah, oklahoma. billy travels on his own by walking there and gets them. with the extra $10 his grandfather gave him, he buys gifts for his family: a pair of overalls for his dad, cloth for making dresses for his mom and sisters, and a bag of candy for his sisters. on the way back home, he spends the night in robber's cave on sparrow hawk mountain. there he builds a fire and plays with the puppies. while trying to sleep, he hears a noise that at first seems like a woman screaming, but he soon realizes it is really that of a mountain lion from far away. both puppies run to the mouth of the cave and challenge the cat. billy worries for them, and he remembers that his father told him "mountain lions are scared of fire," so he makes fire and waits for morning. in the morning, he continues on. he comes to a sycamore tree and sees the names dan and ann carved inside a heart in the bark and decides to name the puppies old dan and little ann. to train his dogs, billy catches a raccoon with the help of his grandfather and uses the fur to teach them how to trail one. during their training, their personalities become apparent: old dan is brave and strong, while little ann is very intelligent. both are very loyal to each other and to billy. on the first day of the hunting season, billy takes his dogs out for their very first hunt. he promises them that if they tree a raccoon, he will do the rest. they are very ready to chase their first raccoon in a large tree, which billy had before nicknamed "the big tree", and is one of the largest in the woods. as he tries to call his well-trained dogs off the hunt, they look at him sadly and he cuts down the enormous tree to keep his promise — an exhausting effort that takes him a few days of chopping and costs him blistered hands. in the end, when about to give up his effort, he offers a short prayer for strength to continue. mysteriously, a strong wind starts to blow and the tree comes crashing down. old dan and little ann take the raccoon down. billy, old dan, and little ann go out hunting almost every night. as months go by, he brings more fur to his grandfather's store than any other hunter, and the stories of his dogs spread throughout the ozarks. one day, he and his grandfather make a bet with rubin and rainie pritchard, that his hounds can catch the legendary "ghost coon." the pritchard boys set out with him to see if old dan and little ann can catch it. it leads them on a long, complicated chase, and the pritchard boys want to give up. but billy is determined. finally, when they have it treed, billy refuses to kill it. just as rubin starts to beat up billy, old dan and little ann begin to attack the pritchards' dog, old blue. rubin runs to attack them with an axe, but he falls on it and kills himself. billy is very distraught afterward. finally he goes to rubin's grave with some flowers, then feels much better. a few weeks later, billy's grandfather enters him into a championship raccoon hunt, putting him against experienced hunters and the finest dogs in all the country. before it starts, he enters little ann into a contest for the best-looking dog, where she wins and is given the silver cup. on the fourth night of the hunt, old dan and little ann chase three raccoons, making it to the final round. the sixth night, they chase one before a blizzard hits. billy, his dad, grandfather, and the judge lose sight of them. when they finally find them, billy's grandfather falls and sprains his ankle which prevents him from walking. they built a fire, and when billy's dad chops down a tree, three raccoons rise. the dogs take down two of them, and chase the third one to another tree. in the morning, the hunters find them covered with ice circling the bottom of a tree. the last raccoon wins them the championship and the gold cup. billy's mom and sisters are overjoyed. billy keeps up his hunting. one night, however, his dogs tree a mountain lion. old dan howls defiantly, and the big cat attacks. billy is horrified, and with his axe he enters the fray, hoping to save his dogs, but they end up having to save him. eventually, the dogs defeat the mountain lion, but old dan is badly wounded, and billy soon finds old dan's intestines in a bush. he dies the next day. billy is heartbroken, but little ann is so sad that she loses her will to live, and dies a few days later. billy's papa tries to tell him that it is all for the best, because with the money he has earned, they hope to move to town. he does not completely recover

the story starts in the little town of menton (april 1959) where angela tuck spends some time with the recently widowed con-man mark lewson. lewson, who’s waiting for some economic gain, steals 40,000 francs from angela and is trying to his luck at a casino. after he’s lost almost everything he is rescued by professional player max de freville and leaves the casino with 100,000 francs. de freville makes him a proposition. two of his colleagues, gamblers stratis lykiadopolous and jacques des moulins, have got hold of an interesting letter since the latter has seduced the son of a minister of lebanon. this letter proves that the british government (or part of it) planned the suez crisis together with israel. since the two men want to protect the minister’s son they’ve hidden the letter. de freville wants lewson to steal the letter and he accepts the mission and goes to venice, where lykiadopolous lives. during this time, old friends alistair dixon and rupert percival have a discussion about who is going to succeed the former when he retires as mp for the district bishop’s cross. as things turns out, both peter morrison and somerset lloyd-james are candidates for the title. fielding gray, who has, quite literally, lost his face in a bomb explosion and has retired from the army, sees his old friend somerset lloyd-james to ask for work. the always jesuitical lloyd-james can’t see a reason to refuse and will give his old friend some work in the literary field. gray also meets tom llewyllyn, who has become a successful writer. llewyllyn is soon to be married to patricia turbot, the younger daughter of the politician sir edwin turbot. during a party at the turbot mansion, where lord canteloupe is drinking rather heavily, carton weir appears to give news about canteloupe becoming secretary for the development of british recreational resources. many people around the lord thinks this is outrageous since they consider him a moron. mark lewson is trying to get hold of the letter and succeeds after the son of the minister gets killed by a bomb in paris. lykiadopolous simply gives it to him since he no longer has any reason to hide it. lewson also frequents director burke lawrence, who is pestered by former model penelope holbrook. de freville tells lewson to “do” something about the letter. lloyd-james manages to kick robert constable off the board of strix on a technical question. he replaces him with lord canteloupe. gregory stern wants to become publisher for gray and even print an edited version of his journal, in more literary form. gray becomes a lodger at tessie's, who also takes in jude holbrook, who hasn’t been seen in years. lewson manages to sell the letter to lloyd-james and the two of them visit sir edwin to persuade him to give the party’s support to lloyd-james. tom and patricia marry at midsummer and most of the characters attend the wedding. grey and morrison meet for the first time since 1955, salinger is trying to suck up to the rather drunk lord canteloupe and even sir edwin becomes rather drunk and sentimental. a cigarette causes a fire and the firemen arrive right at the moment when isobel turbot and mark lewson take of in a sports car. a fireman is even killed in the tumult. lord canteloupe struggles with a camp site he has constructed called “westward ho!” with the help of maisie and some torture, jude holbrook nabs the letter from lloyd-james. unknowing, sir edwin has made his party support lloyd-james. de freville, plagued by mental problems, gives a last scandalous evening of gambling and later tells his friend captain detterling about the letter and the many twists the story has taken. a number of persons are now chasing isobel and mark (mostly mark): a group consisting of morrison, detterling and gray; the team alfie schroeder and tom llewyllyn and also carlton weir, sent out by lloyd-james. maisie tells gray about how holbrook stole the letter from lloyd-james and after some detective work he finds him hiding at his mothers. holbrook threatens gray with acid but the already disfigured gray isn’t very afraid and overcomes holbrook. he is now owner of the letter. at that time, isobel and mark arrive at “westward ho!” and try to act like normal campers. by coincidence almost all of the different search parties arrive at the site at the same time. mark and isobel, returning with their car, have an accident and mark dies. while the friendly stern is comforting the hysterical isobel the other argues about what to do with the letter. lord canteloupe eventually destroys it. this doesn’t make things easier for morrison since sir edward and the tories continue to back lloyd-james, a man they consider easier to handle than the always “moral” morrison. towards the end of the book tom and patricia can, at last, have their honeymoon while stern marries isobel. in the last scene angela tuck (again) and max de freville discuss everything that has happened. ||| 3 ||| 6
the book consists of three parts and an epilogue. drawing from fred singer and dennis avery's unstoppable global warming, booker presents a graph showing changes in temperature and carbon dioxide concentration over the last 11,000 years. in his analysis, rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the 1970s led scientists such as paul ehrlich to postulate that the earth, as a result of the greenhouse effect, may have been heating up or cooling down, either of which could have potentially disastrous consequences. figures such as the environmental activist maurice strong and scientist bert bolin are then introduced, who would, according to booker, "play a crucial role in what lay ahead" in influencing governmental policy and helping form the scientific basis for global warming. booker contends that 1988 was a key year in which the ipcc was set up and james hansen appeared at the senate committee of natural resources in washington, where he stated that he was "99 percent certain" that man's contribution to the greenhouse effect was the cause of global warming. according to booker, "on all sides 'global warming' became the cause of the moment" after hansen's appearance. he then describes how: * in 1990, the ipcc published its first assessment report which made projections of future temperature rises; * at the rio de janeiro earth summit "politicians from 154 countries queued up to sign a 'un framework convention on climate change'" that would "commit all the signatory governments to a voluntary reduction of greenhouse gas emissions"; * the second ipcc report (sar) in 1995 found that the "body of statistical evidence now points to a discernible human influence on the global climate". booker writes that the sar was criticised by frederick seitz, who alleged that "more than 15 sections in chapter 8 of the report—the key chapter setting out the scientific evidence for and against a human influence over climate—were changed or deleted after the scientists charged with examining this question had accepted the supposedly final text". part one ends with an account of the signing of the 1997 kyoto protocol and the setting of new targets for reduced emissions. booker begins part two by asserting that the medieval warm period "contradicted the idea that late twentieth century temperatures had suddenly shot up to a level never known before in history", and that this problem was dealt with by a 1999 graph depicting temperatures "suddenly shooting up in the twentieth century to a level that was quite unprecedented. familiar features such as the medieval warm period and the little ice age simply vanished". booker writes that the graph became the "supreme iconic image for all those engaged in the battle to save the world from global warming". he then states that the ipcc's methods, and in particular the draft summary of its next report, came in for serious criticism from scientists such as richard lindzen. booker then examines davis guggenheim's oscar-winning film an inconvenient truth and the subsequent questioning of many of its assertions, including retreating glaciers, drowning polar bears, use of the "hockey stick" graph, the melting of the ice caps and snows of kilimanjaro and rising sea levels. booker begins part three by quoting the statement of the then british environment secretary that the ipcc's fourth assessment report was "another nail in the coffin of the climate change deniers". booker contrasts this assertion with what he sees as evidence emerging to the contrary: that the earth had in fact begun to cool, possibly as a result of solar variation, and that may thus not be the only driver of climate change. however, the results of research into this theory by the scientists knud lassen, eigil friis-christensen and henrik svensmark were dismissed by bert bolin as "scientifically extremely naïve and irresponsible". booker then alleges that a "consensus" and "counter-consensus" had begun to form, and gives details of a 2007 report by the us senator james inhofe that claimed to list 400 scientists "now prepared to express their dissent, sometimes in the strongest terms, from the ipcc's 'consensus' view of global warming". booker then quotes the june 2007 international energy agency announcement that the cost of halving emissions by 2050 (the us and uk governments were intending 80% cuts) would be us$ 45 trillion—equivalent to "two thirds of the world's entire current annual economic output". booker sums up the book's contents in a long epilogue, which quotes theseus in a midsummer's night dream: in the night, imagining some fear, how easy is a bush supposed a bear booker contends that in this quote shakespeare is identifying that &#34;when we are not presented with enough information for our minds to resolve something into certainty, they may be teased into exaggerating it into something quite different from what it really is&#34;. ||| 4 ||| 4
the sixth novel in the series sends kinsey to floral beach, california, while back at home, henry pitts is having her garage apartment rebuilt after it was destroyed at the end of e is for evidence. she has been hired by royce fowler, who wants her to delve into the past to exonerate his son of the murder of jean timberlake, seventeen years before. bailey, who had been a teen tearaway, pleaded guilty to killing jean, his sometime girlfriend, but escaped from prison soon afterwards. he's apparently been living the life of a model citizen under an assumed name but has just been recaptured and is claiming his innocence. kinsey heads to floral beach, a tiny local community, to pursue the cold trail, and stays with the fowler family at their motel. royce is dying of cancer, his wife oribelle is sick with diabetes and their daughter, ann, bailey's senior by 5 years, has taken leave of absence from her job as a counsellor at the local high school to provide care. bailey's lawyer, jack clemson, fills her in on the details of the case: jean, 17 when she died, was a 'problem' child who was doing badly at school and engaged in numerous sexual encounters with the local boys at school - and, as it turns out, some of the local men too. she was pregnant at the time of her death. everyone knows everyone in floral beach and kinsey acquaints herself with a number of the locals in pursuit of the truth: pearl, the local bar-owner, whose son's evidence put bailey on the spot at the time of jean's death, tap granger, who was bailey's accomplice in several robberies before the murder, the unattractive local pastor reverend haws and his wife, and the local doctor dr dunne, whose wife elva turns out to have a violent objection to being questioned. the high school principal, dwight shales, who was in post at the time of the murder, offers some help, but jean's single mother, shana, whose friendship with dwight is causing raised eyebrows around floral beach, and who is struggling with longstanding alcohol problems, is less co-operative, and refuses to identify jean's father. nobody seems convinced that the killer could be anyone but bailey. at bailey's arraignment, tap granger stages a hold-up, allowing bailey to escape once more, and is himself killed in the process. kinsey gets confirmation from tap's widow that tap was paid to do it - for the first time providing concrete evidence that someone wants to keep bailey discredited. kinsey's room at the motel is broken into, and she receives threatening calls in the middle of the night as she pursues the case. ori is murdered when her insulin, administered regularly by ann, is tampered with. kinsey eventually establishes that dr dunne is jean's unknown father, but shana is murdered when she sets out to keep a rendezvous with him. kinsey ends up running from the cops herself after she finds the body, and seeks refuge with dwight shales, who finally confesses that he was also having an affair with jean, and was probably the father of her child. kinsey wonders whether dwight could be the link between the two, having realised that ann fowler seems jealous of anyone who comes into contact with dwight. she searches ann's room, and finds evidence that ann supplied tap with the hold-up gun and made the anonymous phone calls. unfortunately, she also finds ann waiting for her, armed with a shotgun. jean had confided in her, as school counsellor, that dwight was the father of the child. motivated by jealousy, ann killed her, and being equally jealous of her brother's position as favoured child of their parents, ann was happy to see him take the rap. her plan is to use the money she'll eventually inherit from her parents to tempt dwight, to whom she has been fanatically devoted for years, into marriage. she killed her mother to hasten the plan along, and shana because she was jealous of her friedship with dwight. before ann can kill kinsey, she is accidentally interrupted by royce, who wrestles the gun away from ann, shooting her in the foot accidentally in the process. ann is arrested for the murders of shana and ori, and although there's insufficient evidence to prove her the killer of jean as well, the circumstances are sufficient to ensure that bailey is cleared. ||| 6 ||| 6

a year after the events of the first novel, stephanie edgeley (now known as valkyrie cain) continues to work with skulduggery pleasant, an undead skeleton detective, capturing villains for the sanctuary. the sanctuary is now ruled by thurid guild in a new location after the massacre in the previous sanctuary. soon baron vengeous (one of the original three generals of mevolent) escapes his prison and begins searching for the armor of lord vile, another one of mevolent's generals with which he will be able to resurrect the grotesquery, a hybrid monster made from a faceless one's remains with the power bring back the faceless ones. arriving in ireland, he meets an accomplice vampire named dusk. he orders dusk to kidnap valkyrie cain. dusk bites and enslaves two humans to help him. after losing to skulduggery pleasant, baron vengeous goes after china sorrows who was once part of a cult that worshiped the faceless ones and also included serpine and vengous himself. the baron confronts china sorrows in her apartment whilst valkyrie is visiting. valkyrie hides whilst china and vengous talk. vengeous reveals that he was released from prison by an assassin named billy-ray sanguine who promptly arrives along with dusk. a battle ensues during which valkyrie reveals herself and defends china. valkyrie cain is soon chased by billy-ray sanguine who can travel through earth and buildings. after being in a struggle, valkyrie is saved by tanith low. in the progress valkyrie steals billy-ray sanguine's razor, his primary weapon, leaving the psychopathic assassin with a grudge against her. valkyrie and skulduggery along with a convict called vaurien scapegrace went to the magician's village of roarhaven to find a mysterious man called the torment who has information they need. after a battle in a seedy pub with some thugs (including a giant) and an unpleasant incident with some massive spiders, they find the torment and ask for his help. the torment only says he will help them find vile's armour if skulduggery kills valkyrie, who is descended from the ancients whom the torment despises, as he thinks any power will corrupt civilization. skulduggery takes valkyrie around a corner and they summon her reflection, a living mirror image of valkyrie who she uses as a decoy, enabling her to live a double life. skulduggery takes valkyrie's reflection before the torment and shoots it. the torment is satisfied and tells skulduggery the whereabouts of the grotesquery. he and valkyrie return scapegrace to prison and go to find the grotesquery, unfortunately vengeous's minions have already obtained it. soon after, skullduggery and valkyrie take the reflection back to valkyries's house. valkyrie touches the mirror to absorb its memories and remembers what it is like to be shot. valkyrie then notices that whenever she tries to look back in her memories one part always remains blank and she cannot pin it down. she realizes that her reflection hid something from her, and finds it disconcerting and dangerous. however, she goes on with skulduggery without mentioning it to him. valkyrie is kidnapped by sanguine who takes her to an old abandoned church to the faceless ones where she is taken before the altar where vengeous awaits her. the evil sorcerer cuts valkyrie's finger and spills some of her blood onto the grotesquery's body before using the armour's shadow powers which mingle with the blood. skulduggery subsequently arrives and rescues valkyrie. after stealing the grotesquery, valkyrie is incapacitated and wakes up in hospital. while wearing a 'respectable' blue hospital gown, skulduggery wears a pink one decorated with bunnies and elephants for the doctor's amusement. skulduggery turns the lifeless grotesquery over to the sanctuary's top scientist to take apart, however, the grotesquery has already absorbed a lot of power from vile's armour and valkyrie's blood, and so wakes up in the middle of the night whilst being operated on. he kills the scientist's assistants and goes after valkyrie. skulduggery and tanith arrive and the three of them attack the grotesquery before escaping. meanwhile, members of sanctuary's all across the world are being murdered by assassins to distract people from vengeous's plan. billy-ray sanguine has also released springheeled jack from prison and sends him after a sanctuary official in london. after discovering that he is being manipulated by vengous in a plan to bring back the faceless ones, jack kills his victim. skulduggery works out that vengeous is actually a pawn in someone else's plan and accuses thurid guild of being in league with this mystery benefactor. in a rage, guild fires skulduggery who decides to go after vengous anyway. valkyrie begrudgingly goes to her family reunion as a distraction to dusk. the torment, meanwhile, has discovered that valkyrie is alive and goes after her only to be confronted by skulduggery and tanith low. the torment transforms into a giant spider but skulduggery and tanith defeat him nevertheless. valkyrie is subsequently attacked by vampires and forced to flee. dusk corners her and vows that when he has transformed her into a vampire he's going to set her loose on her parents while in her bloodlust. valkyrie stabs dusk in the leg with the syringe he uses to curb his vampiric side whilst he is transforming, and as a result, he is caught between vampire and human and put in intense pain. springheeled jack comes and rescues her and defeats dusk so as to frustrate vengeous's plans because he doesn't want the faceless ones to return. meanwhile china is attacked by vengous in an underground carpark. the dark wizard brutally murders china's bodyguards and viciously beats her unconscious before taking her to clearwater hospital, his headquarters. accompanied by tanith low, mr bliss and some cleavers, skulduggery and valkyrie go to clearwater hospital and do battle with the grotesquery

the novel begins with nicky desota, a timid mortgage broker in a fascist america who draws the unwelcome attention of nyla christophe, an fbi agent investigating a break-in at a government lab by what proves to be a dominic desota from an alternate universe. used as a pawn by christophe's con-man boyfriend larry douglas to entrap an activist former actor (who turns out to be ronald reagan), he is later detained and brought to new mexico to unravel a mystery. the focus then shifts to another dominic desota, a united states senator having an affair with nyla christophe bowquist, who in this world is a famous violinist. contacted by the military, he travels to sandia national laboratories, where he meets an identical version of himself—a "cat" from an alternate universe. as senator desota interviews his alternate-universe counterpart, the man vanishes after offering a cryptic warning. as the senator leaves the building, he and the base commander are captured by a detachment of troops led by major dominic p. desota, the commander of a military force from yet another universe. major desota's mission is revealed to be to secure the parallel-world research facilities of senator desota's universe, which is the first step in a larger military operation. in major desota's universe (which is subsequently designated paratime gamma) a militaristic united states is engaged in a tense standoff with the soviet union, and wants to use senator desota's universe (paratime epsilon) to launch sneak attacks against them. after being transported to paratime gamma, senator desota manages to escape by distracting his guard (gamma's version of nyla christophe) and escaping through a portal with a scientist to paratime tau—the home universe of nicky desota. after being discovered in the desert, senator desota and the scientist—who is larry douglas from another universe—are captured and interrogated by agent christophe. in an interrogation session involving the senator, the scientist, and their counterparts from paratime tau, douglas reveals that he is from paratime alpha, and that he was forced by the military in paratime gamma to give them the ability to travel between universes. as agent christophe begins to pressure douglas to give her government similar assistance, she and the other fbi agent with her are rendered unconscious by knockout darts fired by dominic desota—the same dominic desota who had escaped interrogation in sandia. desota brings the entire group back to his universe—paratime alpha—where he explains that since the senator's escape that paratime gamma has invaded the epsilon's washington d.c. in a failed bid to capture the president. he also reveals that travel between universes is creating a growing problem of "ballistic recoil," where the boundaries between the universes is growing weaker, causing matter and energy to cross unintentionally from one universe to the next (something depicted in interludes between the chapters). he brings the travelers to washington d.c., where they cross over to paratime epsilon in an effort to help stop the invasion. before they can help, however, every "cat" located in a different universe disappears, along with any scientists involved in paratime research. there they are informed that they have been transported by a group of more advanced alternate earths in order to stop ballistic recoil before it escalates and the barriers between universes become irreparably permeable. the "cats" are relocated to new york city on a new earth, one being resettled after its inhabitants wiped themselves out. there the paratime transplants gradually settle into new lives. six months after his arrival, nicky desota returns to new york to propose to agent christophe. now working on a collective farm in palm springs, he has embraced the opportunity for a new life and developed into a much more confident man. after considering his proposal, the nyla of his world accepts. on their trip back to california, however, nicky reveals to her his expectation that their transplantation has not solved the problem of paratime travel—that with an infinite number of earths, the number of them that will develop the ability to cross into alternate worlds will only increase, so many that the problem of ballistic recoil may prove to be unavoidable. ||| 5 ||| 5

qiro anturasi, royal cartographer of nalenyr, had been instrumental for his family's reputation as the most reliable map-charter in the known world. merchants and princes all sought his clan's maps, even as the house of anturasi continued sending out expeditions to expand their wealth of information, surveying unmapped territories, making detail notes of fauna, flora and geography. the anturasi had been vital to nalenyr's growing wealth and rise in power. considered a crucial state treasure that must not fall into the wrong hands, qiro was confined, on orders and under protection of the naleni princes, to his estate anturasikun in moriande, capital of nalenyr. there, he continued to oversee his clan's map-making enterprise, training the scions of the clan into the family trade, ruthlessly subjecting them to rigorous training and demands, for more than half a century. now, the family stood poised on the brink of a historical breakthrough event which could catapult their standing further and beyond the imagination of rival map-makers. intertwined with their mission were the political ramifications for nalenyr, the aggressive northern state of deseiron, and helosunde which served as buffer between the two former powers. much of helosunde had been under desei occupation, and nalenyr provided helosundian refugees sanctuary and support to confound desei designs on nalenyr. qiro's grandsons, jorim and keles, were tasked with undertakings that would take them in opposite directions. jorim was to embark on a specially commissioned ship stormwolf to make accurate longitudinal charts at sea with a secret new instrument. keles was to tasked to rediscover the lost segment of the pre-cataclysmic spice route, which would take him into ground zero of the cataclysm, a region where the ancient wild magic still raged. nirati, sister to jorim and keles, remained behind in moriande to hold the fort, for stakes were high and there were many hidden players whose intrigues threatened her beloved brothers. meanwhile, in the aftermath of the devastations caused by the wild magic, the jaecai who had not departed with empress cyrsa's expedition, continued the xidantzu tradition in their schools martial arts. their best students became itinerant warriors who travelled the realms to help fight injustice without regard to political affiliations. moraven tolo was one such warrior. when hints to powerful cache of ancient weapons, imbued with magicks from their former wielders, came to his attention, the jaecais became concerned that opportunistic parties would see it as an easy means of raising a strong army without the necessary ability, discipline and experience to control the power, possibly leading to history repeating itself. ||| 2 ||| 2
rayford steele, chloe steele, buck williams and bruce barnes find themselves left behind. this group of believers, as well as others left behind but becoming believers, are otherwise known as "tribulation saints", to differentiate from the pre-rapture designation of christian. the question of what to do in response to this radical change in situation arises. they propose to fight the perceived threat that antichrist nicolae carpathia poses in the form of eradicating all religion and establishing a single world religion. the dogma consists that "there is no heaven nor hell, just [the left-behind]." in addition, nicolae twisted the message of world-famous rabbi tsion ben-judah about messiah, in order to point to himself as thus. buck flies to jerusalem to meet ben-judah and present him to the two witnesses (described in revelation) stationed at the united nations-blockaded wailing wall. he converts to christianity, believing that jesus is the one and only messiah; thus disproving carpathia. during the prophesied eighteen months of peace following the covenant with israel, chloe and buck are married, along with rayford and new believer amanda white. however, both buck, who becomes publisher of global community weekly, formerly global weekly, and rayford, who is handpicked to pilot carpathia’s jet, are in the distressing position of watching carpathia, now supreme potentate of the u.n. - now reorganized into the global community- strengthen his grip on the world, witnessing how he orchestrates world war iii to bring the former world powers under his heel and how he bamboozles israeli botanist chaim rosenzweig into giving the gc his illustrious eden formula for a gc-guaranteed peace treaty with israel, thus initiating the tribulation. as world war iii breaks out, the tribulation force suffers its first casualty in the death of their pastor, bruce barnes, who was killed in a bombing in the now-decimated city of chicago. ||| 2 ||| 5

following the events of 1634: the galileo affair, pope urban viii had been won over to the actions of the americans after being saved from his attempted assassination and his subsequent pardon of galileo galilei. however, pope urban's relations with the americans and their allies earned the scorn of his historical enemy cardinal gaspar borja y velasco, who had been loudly critical of the actions, or inactions, of the holy see in regard to gustavus adolphus, galileo, and now cardinal larry mazzare, and had been briefly banned from rome by urban. cardinal borja returned to rome, though living in the outskirts of the city, and having cultivated allies with the spanish element of the vatican and acquiring the aid of francisco de quevedo y villega, a mercenary agent provocateur, is ordered by king philip iv of spain to stir up trouble within rome with the efforts of discrediting urban and turning him into a lame duck pope after urban failed to support spain in her war against the united states of europe (use). borja exceeds these orders, orchestrating a military coup to overthrow urban, which also caused the deaths of urban's political allies including his cardinal-nephew antonio barberini, and replace him with a spanish puppet. fortunately, urban escaped from his second attempted death with the help from the american roman embassy, leading to borja being declared an anti-pope, with only spain and its satellites recognizing his authority as the new pope. ||| 5 ||| 4
new york post best book of 2016we often think of our capacity to experience the suffering of others as the ultimate source of goodness many of our wisest policymakers activists scientists and philosophers agree that the only problem with empathy is that we dont have enough of itnothing could be farther from the truth argues yale researcher paul bloom in against empathy bloom reveals empathy to be one of the leading motivators of inequality and immorality in society far from helping us to improve the lives of others empathy is a capricious and irrational emotion that appeals to our narrow prejudices it muddles our judgment and ironically often leads to cruelty we are at our best when we are smart enough not to rely on it but to draw instead upon a more distanced compassionbasing his argument on groundbreaking scientific findings bloom makes the case that some of the worst decisions made by individuals and nationswho to give money to when to go to war how to respond to climate change and who to imprisonare too often motivated by honest yet misplaced emotions with precision and wit he demonstrates how empathy distorts our judgment in every aspect of our lives from philanthropy and charity to the justice system from medical care and education to parenting and marriage without empathy bloom insists our decisions would be clearer fairer andyesultimately more moralbrilliantly argued urgent and humane against empathy shows us that when it comes to both major policy decisions and the choices we make in our everyday lives limiting our impulse toward empathy is often the most compassionate choice we can make ||| 4 ||| 4
most of the story is centred around mcmurdo station, the largest settlement in antarctica, which is run as a scientific research station by the united states. robinson's characteristic multiple-protagonist style is employed here to show many aspects of polar life; among the viewpoints presented are those of x, an idealistic young man working as a general field assistant at mcmurdo; val, an increasingly embittered trek guide; and wade norton, who works for the californian senator phil chase (wade and phil also appear in the "science in the capital" trilogy). as well as mcmurdo, the story involves the amundsen-scott south pole station, the shackleton glacier, the mcmurdo dry valleys and a south american drilling platform near roberts massif. antarctica involves many of the ideas robinson uses elsewhere; as in the mars trilogy, much emphasis is placed on the importance of living sustainably and the issues of existing in a hostile environment. the significance of antarctica as a "continent for science" is contrasted with the need to provide a decent environment also for the support staff essential in a place so marginal. other recurring themes include rock-climbing, physical athleticism, the process and ideology of science, exploitation of natural resources, and the formation of cooperative and anarchic social systems. the novel was heavily influenced by robinson's 1995 stay in antarctica as part of the national science foundation's antarctic artists and writers program, and was nominated for a locus award in 1998. ||| 5 ||| 4

the book’s premise is that the moon is a massive space ship controlled by a self-aware computer that wants its rightful crew back aboard. the book begins with a prologue recording a mutiny aboard the planetoid-sized utu-class starship of the fourth imperium (a 55,000+ year old technologically advanced multi-star system empire), the dahak, led by its chief of engineering, the ambitious and psychopathic captain anu. anu's ostensible reason for mutiny is to lead his followers to refuge on some remote planet where presumably the genocidal wrath of the "achuultani", a mysterious alien race that periodically exterminates all intelligent life it can find, and which has destroyed the previous two imperiums, will pass over them. the loyal crew is taken by surprise, and unable to defeat the mutineers. faced with no choice, the captain orders dahak to execute "red two internal"—a command which will flood the entirety of the interior of the vessel with extremely deadly gases and compounds; this action will force both mutineers and loyalists to the lifeboats, and the vessel will then, acting on its other orders from the captain, allow back in the dahak only the loyal crew and blow the disloyal members out of space. red two unfortunately entails the death of the captain as well. because of his death, he is unable to command dahak to destroy the mutineers as they leave aboard warships, not lifeboats, and the captain is equally unable to undo anu's systematic sabotage of the power generators, intended to kill dahak by starving it of power and thereby rendering it open to conquest by anu's forces. unfortunately for anu, dahaks computer systems catch the sabotage before it utterly wrecks all the power plants, but the damage is so severe that it is forced to cease all communications and non-necessary expenditures of power. indeed, the damage takes decades to repair—by which point none of the loyal crew is still alive or able to contact the dahak, which places the ship in a dilemma in which it cannot return to the imperium as it has been ordered to, but nor can it exterminate the mutineers as other, equally important, orders dictate. this impasse lasts for approximately 50,000 years, until the earthling's early space program sends up one lieutenant commander colin macintyre to map the dark side of the heavenly body dahak had camouflaged itself as—the moon, as a "dress rehearsal" for a similar trip scheduled for mars. his mission is hijacked by dahak and his death is faked; had macintyre returned with his data, dahak’s cover would have been blown. while aboard, dahak (the ai, not the vessel proper) explains the situation to macintyre, and prevails upon him to, as a descendant of the loyalists, to become dahak’s newest captain, and to quickly exterminate the mutineers—quickly, because imperium installations are being methodically destroyed, sure signs of the beginning of the latest achuultani incursion. macintyre reluctantly accepts. the first step to making him the true captain is to massively revamp his body surgically, granting him nigh superhuman resilience, speed, and strength, in addition to the built-in electronics granting matchless control of imperium technology. while dahak has known for thousands of years where anu's forces have bunkered up—under the south pole in antarctica—their base is protected by extremely strong force fields, force fields so strong that to penetrate them and destroy the base would require dahaks heavy weaponry, which would inevitably kill a significant percentage of the human population of earth; an untenable action, to say the least. macintyre returns to his old home to renew contacts with his elder brother, sean, and to enlist him in a scheme to discover the mutineers' agent in the space program. it initially succeeds, but when he and sean attempt to contact the agent, they discover their scan of the space program building was detected, and that it was a trap. macintyre and sean fend off some of the mutineers (at the cost of sean's life), but is rescued by an acquaintance, who sends him through a tunnel where he is captured by another group of mutineers. this group, led by former missile tech horus, was a dissident splinter faction of anu's, which turned against him after the mutiny. despite supporting anu during the mutiny itself, horus and his crew committed a double mutiny against anu and fled into hiding on earth. once they reached earth, they entered stasis so that the crew would be able to survive however long it would take for civilization to reappear on earth (anu at the time enforced primativism). now, with civilization and technology emerging on earth, his group has begun a passive, behind-the-scenes war against anu. because they are heavily outnumbered in weaponry, they have been forced to always play it very carefully. as a result, the crew of the battleship has created a huge network of humans, many of whom are descendants of nergal's crew. however, the arrival of the macintyre means that the end has begun, for dahak has at last taken a hand in the game. eventually, this group and its battleship, the nergal, joins macintyre, and they embark on a grand plan to destroy anu: first, they rapidly and effectively destroy a number of important installations that anu's terrorists and other forces are based out of (convincing anu to withdraw all of his important personnel back to the main base), then they have their agents inside the antarctica base steal the codes to gain access for them; finally, they fake a major defeat, and when anu relaxes, certain that they were cowed and hurt, their now-at-liberty agents send them the codes and they launch a full assault, backed up by dahak's orbital weaponry. the assault costs them dearly, but anu is killed and his forces captured or dead. with the full revelation of dahak’s power, the world's governments have little choice but to submit to the planetary governor macintyre. however, colin has little time to unify the world, because the achuultani draw ever nearer, and the imperium is silent, even when dahak’s communication systems are repaired. at the end, macintyre leaves the world under the care of old horus, and departs for the nearest fleet imperium base, hoping to call upon imperial assistance. ||| 5 ||| 5
in the early 21st century, zane is living a pathetic life without money or employment. when a magic gem merchant cheats zane out of an opportunity for romance, zane decides to take his own life. as he starts to pull the trigger, he sees the specter of death (thanatos) advancing on him. startled, he pulls the gun from his own head and shoots death right between the eyes. he is then visited by a woman who introduces herself as fate, who insists that zane must now assume the position of the man he has killed, since whoever kills death must become the new death. as zane makes his way downstairs, he gets his first view of a pale limousine with the license plate reading "mortis"...his death steed (death rides a pale horse) who can assume the form of a pale boat, a plane, or a pale limousine, as well as the form of a pale horse. fate then departs and leaves zane in the care of chronos, the incarnation of time, who then instructs zane how to use his deathwatch, how mortis changes form, how to use other instruments of the office, and exactly what his new duties are. this entails residing in purgatory and visiting earth to collect the souls of humans who are in a close balance of good and evil and cannot determine their eternal destination (heaven or hell) without help. in the course of learning the job, he discovers that his coming into the office of death was not accidental, but was manipulated by a powerful magician (cedric kaftan jr.). despite being a mortal, this magician has strong ties to the other incarnations from purgatory and reveals to zane that the incarnation of fate arranged zane's destiny for the magician's purpose. there is a prophecy which states that luna kaftan, the magician's daughter, is destined to go into politics and thwart the schemes of satan, the incarnation of evil. luna kaftan is thus a target for the forces of hell and is in need of supernatural protection. the magician, who has done a great deal of research, feels that zane is the best candidate for the incarnation of death to fall in love with luna and thus want to protect her. the only way for the magician kaftan to meet with death without satan's knowledge is to die with his soul in balance. the magician chooses to sacrifice his own life in order to introduce zane to luna and explain to zane the circumstances which brought him into the office of death. the dead magician's plans however seem to go awry. due to manipulation by satan, luna is also destined to die before she can fulfill the prophecy. the magician had used too much black magic for his soul to be in balance. in order to bring it into balance before committing suicide, he has transferred the excess evil on his soul to luna's soul, whom he has assumed to be innocent of evil. however, luna has a burden of evil on her soul already, and her father's scheme has put her on the course to hell. to correct this, she volunteers to switch places with one of death's other clients. by sacrificing her own life to save another, she manages to balance the evil on her soul. her actions play right into satan's trap, who doesn't care whether she goes to heaven or hell, only that she dies and is no longer a threat to his plots. however, zane has already fallen in love with luna by this time, just like the magician had planned, and he refuses to take the soul of the woman he loves. now the motives behind the magician's choice of zane are made clear to him when the other four incarnations (time, fate, war, and nature) from purgatory approach him and explain that they were all in on the plan. the previous death could not be manipulated into betraying the duties of his office for love, so the incarnations_of_immortality decided to replace him with a young, stubborn man like zane, who could. because luna's soul is next in the queue, zane cannot take the souls of other mortals until he deals with hers. he refuses to do so, thereby going on strike and leaving dying mortals in agony, unable to be released by death. as this is not to satan's advantage, he first tries to bribe zane, then intimidate him into going back to work. zane, however, has had a conversation with gaea, the incarnation of nature, who has demonstrated to him the absolute power each incarnation wields in its own sphere of influence. zane eventually realizes that the office of death is unassailable by satan and that he cannot be harmed within the sphere of that office. as an incarnation, satan himself has a soul and is subject to zane's dominion. the conflict ends in a draw and satan has no choice but to admit defeat. with satan's plot exposed, purgatory changes luna's destiny and she is free to return to life. zane lifts his strike, and with luna under his protection, satan can no longer interfere with her fate through the means of death. ||| 2 ||| 2
the book centers on a boy, bastian balthazar bux, who is neglected by his father (who has sunken into despair after his wife's death) and is bullied by his schoolmates. whilst running from some of them, bastian bursts into the antique book store of carl conrad coreander. bastian steals a book from the store called the neverending story which coreander has been reading; he hides in his school's attic, where he proceeds to read the story through the rest of the day and the night, not realizing that he has effectively become a part of it. after a while of reading he is magically transfixed and is brought into the book. the book begins in fantastica, when a "will-o'-the-wisp" goes to ask the childlike empress for help against the nothing, which is spreading over the land. the empress is ill, which is believed to be the cause of the nothing (or vice versa); she sends the only person that can stop the nothing, a boy warrior named atreyu, to find a cure for her. atreyu is a brave person, being considered a warrior even though he is a young boy of bastian's age. while on his quest, atreyu meets characters such as morla the aged one, the incorporeal oracle uyulala, and the gnomes urgl and engywook. atreyu also meets falkor, the luckdragon, who helps him along the way. after atreyu and falkor get in the way of a fight of the wind giants, atreyu gets thrown off falkor's back and ends up in spook city, atreyu meets gmork the werewolf, who has been following atreyu since the early days of his quest, intending to kill him. in the course of his quest, atreyu learns about the true nature of fantastica and the nothing: fantastica is a representation of the dreams and fantasies of the real world; the nothing and the sickness of the childlike empress are the effects of the lies humans use in their greed for power; it is the denial of dreams and fantasy which is destroying fantastica. the only thing that can save fantastica is a human child, who must give the childlike empress a new name to start again the cycle of life in fantastica. falkor and atreyu return to the ivory tower, where the childlike empress lives. but since bastian, in his lack of confidence, hesitates to take the step into fantastica, the childlike empress confronts him with the fact that whatever he may think, he has already become part of the neverending story, and he must carry out his part in it. and bastian does so by crying out the name he has chosen for the empress: 'moonchild'. bastian comes to fantastica and meets the empress; she asks him to help re-build fantastica with his imagination, and he subsequently has many adventures of his own in his new world. with the help of auryn, a medallion that links him to the empress, that gives him power over all the inhabitants of fantastica and grants all of the boy's wishes, bastian explores the desert of colors, battles the evil witch xayide, and meets the three deep thinkers. bastian and atreyu become friends. however, due to bastian's continuous wishing with the the gem - which costs a memory each time - he begins to lose his true self, to wit, atreyu becomes increasingly more worried about him. xayide exploits the growing tension between the two, driving bastian to a lust for power and eventually having himself crowned as childlike emperor. atreyu leads a rebellion against bastian, but narrowly escapes with his life. upon pursuing atreyu, bastian stumbled on a colony of humans who were trapped in fantastica - having lost all their memories as they had recklessly indulged in the power of auryn - and realizes what has nearly become of himself. bastian sets out to find the only thing he can wish for without losing himself: his own true wish. after bastian loses his remaining memories, he is aided by atreyu in fulfilling his one true wish, and manages to cure his father at the same time. after returning from fantastica, he decides to return the book to its rightful owner, carl conrad coreander, but the book has gone missing upon his return to the human world. however, mr. coreander reveals he has also been to fantastica once, and the two readily agree to see each other soon and talk about their respective experiences. but as coreander surmises, this is not the true end of the story, as bastian is now likely to lead others onto their way to fantastica in order to preserve both worlds. ||| 2 ||| 2
lanen kaelar is a young woman who has been raised in hadronsstead, believing that hadron (the horse-breeder) was her father. she leads an unhappy life as she secretly longs to meet the dragons of legend, for which she has had a powerful fascination, but she is forced to remain at hadron's farm. when hadron eventually dies, she feels freed. after an abrupt proposal from her cousin (who gets a bruise from her fist in response), she leaves to seek out the true dragons of legend. on the journey she learns that her true father marik has promised her as a demon sacrifice since before her birth, in payment for the making of an artifact that allows the user to see distant people and places. she finds a ship to the dragon isle for the lansip harvest that used to occur every ten years, but no ship has returned from the trip in over 100 years due to the violent storms that lie between kolmar and the dragon isle. after travelling on the ship with her father marik lurking dangerously on board, she makes it safely to the dragon isle and meets akhor, the mighty silver-scaled king of the kantri (known to humans as "dragons"). she seeks him out with the two words that she utters on instinct, that he respects her instantly for; 'my brother?' akhor, weary of the 'ferrinshadik' (a longing to know the mind of another species, similar to what lanen herself feels), reveals himself, and discovers that lanen alone of the humans (gedri) he has ever known, is capable of hearing and replying in truespeech, the kantri form of telepathy. it is a trait all the kantri share. lanen comes to know akhor, and for the first time since the kantri departed the mainland, kantri and gedri are once again communicating with one another. their meetings must be secret and both must break the rules of their people in order to meet with each other. in a madly short time they fall in love, knowing even as it happens that it is folly. when lanen is horribly burned while helping mirazhe, another of the kantri, to give birth to the first dragon child born for many years, akhor is terrified that she will die of her injuries and reluctantly delivers her into the hands of the only healer on the island - an ally of marik's. lanen is swiftly healed by the skilled ministrations of marik's healer, maikel (healers are humans who can wield a magical power to heal others), but is then spirited away by marik, who intends to sacrifice lanen to a demon in order to pay off a dark debt he has long owed. lanen is kept ensorcelled and unable to call for aid, but akhor learns of her plight from rella, a human who came to the island ostensibly to gather lansip leaves (which are worth their weight in silver due to their special healing properties), but she is actually a member of a order of spies, and she was hired to protect lanen. akhor manages to save lanen in the nick of time, slaying the demon lord lanen was to be sacrifed to, but marik and his demon-caller ally caderan manage to avoid akhor's notice. the assembled council of the kantri soon learn of lanen and akhor's love, and their transgressions, and are prepared to sentence them to exile or death when lanen manages to sway them incline them to mercy with an impassioned speech in defense of their actions. however, during lanen's speech, marik, consumed by greed, comes and steals the soulgems of the lost, a precious and irreplaceable treasure of the kantri, while they are distracted. akhor and two other of the kantri pursue marik back to his camp and a battle ensues, for marik and his demon-calling servant caderan had prepared for the possibility of a fight and so had demonic powers and items ready to oppose the kantri with. caderan is slain and marik is driven insane, but akhor suffers terrible wounds at marik's hands and rishkaan, one of the other kantri present at the fight, is killed. akhor as an entity dies of his wounds, but he is mysteriously transformed into human form. together they travel back to kolmar and are eventually married. ||| 2 ||| 2
a mysterious stranger, griffin, arrives at the local inn of the english village of iping, west sussex, during a snowstorm. the stranger wears a long-sleeved, thick coat and gloves, his face hidden entirely by bandages except for a fake pink nose, large goggles and a wide-brimmed hat. he is excessively reclusive, irascible, and unfriendly. he demands to be left alone and spends most of his time in his rooms working with a set of chemicals and laboratory apparatus, only venturing out at night. while staying at the inn, hundreds of strange glass bottles arrive that griffin calls his luggage. many local townspeople believe this to be very strange. he becomes the talk of the village (one of the novel's most charming aspects is its portrayal of small-town life in southern england, which the author knew from first-hand experience). meanwhile, a mysterious burglary occurs in the village. griffin has run out of money and is trying to find a way to pay for his board and lodging. when his landlady demands he pay his bill and quit the premises, he reveals part of his invisibility to her in a fit of pique. an attempt to apprehend the stranger is frustrated when he undresses to take advantage of his invisibility, fights off his would-be captors, and flees to the downs. there griffin coerces a tramp, thomas marvel, into becoming his assistant. with marvel, he returns to the village to recover three notebooks that contain his records of his experiments. when marvel soon attempts to betray the invisible man to the police, griffin chases him to the seaside town of port burdock, threatening to kill him. marvel escapes to a local inn, and is saved by the people at the inn, but griffin escapes. marvel later goes to the police and tells them of this "invisible man," then requests to be locked up in a high security jail cell. his furious attempt to avenge his betrayal leads to his being shot. griffin takes shelter in a nearby house that turns out to belong to dr. kemp, a former acquaintance from medical school. to kemp, he reveals his true identity: the invisible man is griffin, a former medical student who left medicine to devote himself to optics. griffin recounts how he invented medicine capable of rendering bodies invisible and, on an impulse, performed the procedure on himself. griffin tells kemp of his story of how he turned invisible. he tells of how he tries the invisibility on a cat, then himself. griffin burns down the boarding house he is staying in along with all his equipment he used to turn invisible to cover his tracks, but soon realizes he is ill-equipped to survive in the open. he attempts to steal food and clothes from a large store, but eventually he steals some clothing from a theatrical supply shop and heads to iping to attempt to reverse the effect. but now that he imagines he can make kemp his secret confederate, describing his plan to begin a "reign of terror" by using his invisibility to terrorize the nation. kemp has already denounced griffin to the local authorities and is on the watch for help to arrive as he listens to this wild proposal. when the authorities arrive at kemp's house, griffin fights his way out and the next day leaves a note announcing that kemp himself will be the first man to be killed in the "reign of terror". kemp, a cool-headed character, tries to organize a plan to use himself as bait to trap the invisible man, but a note he sends is stolen from his servant by griffin. griffin shoots and kills a local policeman who comes to kemp's aid, then breaks into kemp's house. kemp bolts for the town, where the local citizenry comes to his aid. griffin is seized, assaulted, and killed by a mob. the invisible man's naked, battered body gradually becomes visible as he dies. a local policeman shouts to cover his face with a sheet, then the book concludes. in the final chapter, it is revealed that marvel has secretly kept griffin's notes. griffin's name is not known by anyone (including the reader) until he meets kemp whom he reveals his identity to. until then, he is referred to as the stranger or the invisible man. ||| 0 ||| 6
tobias and rachel liberate a caged red-tailed hawk from a car dealership (dealin' dan hawke's used cars) where it is being used as a mascot in advertisements. later that evening, tobias sees a shimmer in the air and is perplexed by it. he decides to check it out again the next day, and this time notices a flock of geese seemingly run into an invisible wall in the air. tobias suspects the anomaly to be a yeerk ship using optical camouflage and tells the other animorphs about it. the group morphs into wolves to follow the last known direction of the ship into the mountains. they arrive at a lake guarded by park service human-controllers and hork-bajir-controllers. the ship decloaks over the lake, revealing itself to be a massive logistics ship that collects water and air for the yeerk pool ship in orbit. tobias also sees the hawk that he and rachel freed, and has an urge to be with her. the animorphs return from the mountains and make plans to morph into fish in the lake and get sucked up by the ship so they can disable it from the inside, thus deactivating the cloaking device while it is above a city and revealing the yeerk invasion to the general public. tobias heads up to the lake again to scope out potential hiding places, but his hawk instincts overpower him on the way and he kills and eats a rat. greatly disturbed by the experience, he flies to rachel's gymnastics exhibition at the mall and tries to commit suicide. he flies around the mall in a panicked state until marco smashes open a skylight for him (with a baseball) to escape. tobias regresses into his hawk instincts for several days, living in the woods and hunting rodents. his human side only re-emerges when he saves a man escaping from hork-bajir near the mountain lake. he returns to rachel to talk about what happened, and he decides that he needs to keep fighting the yeerks to remain human. the animorphs revisit the lake and hide in a cave until the yeerks arrive. they then morph trout, and tobias carries them to the lake to avoid notice by the yeerks who have locked down the area. the others are successfully sucked up into the ship, but they discover that the water tank is sealed off inside; they are trapped. they communicate this information to tobias and ask him to bring the ship down if possible. meanwhile, tobias is spotted and identified as an "andalite bandit." to avoid attacks from yeerk bug fighters and helicopters, he lands on top of the logistics ship, the one place he can be sure the yeerks won't risk firing. a dozen taxxons emerge out onto the deck to kill him, but tobias aims for its eyes. the taxxon, trying to shield itself, accidentally makes it easier for tobias to grab its dracon beam. he fires the beam at the ship's bridge, causing it to fly out of control and crash into the other yeerk ships (bug fighters and usfs helicopters). a large gash is torn in the side of the ship, and the other animorphs come pouring out with the water that had been collected. they are able to morph into birds and escape. tobias again sees the female hawk, but the yeerks, mistaking her for him, kill her. the remains of the downed truck ship are disposed of by the yeerks, thus leaving no evidence for the animorphs to show the world. tobias is distressed over the death of the hawk, but realizes that it is this emotion that makes him human, as a true hawk would not care if another hawk had died. tobias discusses this with rachel, and begins to accept his newfound balance between being a hawk and a being a human. tobias states that marco had previously acquired a bald eagle morph and that he used it during the escape from the yeerk ship. however, marco never acquired a bald eagle; his raptor morph is an osprey. ||| 7 ||| 2

due to the actions of the high ridge government in war of honor, which led to a successful attack on key alliance shipyards by the republic of haven, the star kingdom of manticore finds itself decidedly on the short end of the strategic balance between the two warring star nations. admiral honor harrington is placed in command of eighth fleet, the manticoran alliance's primary offensive force, which is the sole heavy formation available for operations against haven. queen elizabeth and her senior advisors project it will be at least two "t-years" (terran years, i.e. earth years) before they can expect any significant numbers of new construction to begin bolstering their thin wall of battle; this while haven's progress under admirals theisman and foraker have given them an even larger force advantage, and smaller technological disparity, than haven suffered before the beginning of hostilities in short victorious war. strategically, the goal of honor and eighth fleet is to instill enough operational caution and sensitivity to losses in haven to force redeployments; this would have the desperately needed effect of reducing the available number of ships of the wall haven would then be able to concentrate for offensive action against the star kingdom and its allies. despite the grave circumstances, the star kingdom finds itself spread dangerously thin against its security commitments; to itself and the alliance. at all costs climaxes with the largest and most critical battle of the entire series, the battle of manticore, as havenite forces attack the manticoran home star system. haven comes close to winning the battle, until admiral harrington's eighth fleet intervenes, giving manticore a hard-won victory. both sides suffer heavy losses, and they are temporarily stalemated. honor continues to work closely with hamish alexander, now first lord of the admiralty, on the military and political challenges facing the alliance. their professional respect for each other's abilities, and their need for mutual support as they navigate the precarious political landscape in the star kingdom, has led them into the very romantic embrace the high ridge government tried to insinuate during war of honor. while this is not the dire political crisis it was during the prior star kingdom government, it still offers numerous personal and professional difficulties for them. unfortunately, they find themselves trapped between their emotions and their responsibilities to each other, to the loved ones in their lives, and to the star kingdom and the alliance. the dilemma is resolved when the reverend of grayson engineers a polygamous marriage of honor to hamish and his crippled wife. ||| 5 ||| 5
the book is both an adventure story and a satire on the scientific dispute over creationism. it is set on the planet kforri, where descendants of space travelers from earth have reverted to a pre-technological society. the truth of their origin has faded into legend, and as a result the story of the space voyage and the scientific theory of evolution have become competing accounts of the genesis of humanity. in an ironic reversal, the religionists hold that man evolved from the native animals of kforri, while skeptics against the received dogma, known as the anti-evolutionists, are more open to the spaceflight theory. schoolteacher marko prokopiu, has been found guilty of teaching the anti-evolutionist heresy, as established by the holy syncretic church, but escapes from prison. he embarks on a quest to discover the truth by finding the great fetish, said to contain the real story. a parallel motivation is to recover his wife petronela, who has run off with his friend chet mongami during his imprisonment. marko joins a caravan and falls in with the philosopher doctor halran, a professor who is experimenting with a new hot air balloon. the two are launched in the balloon and land by accident on the island of mnaen, populated only by female 'witches' who guard the great fetish. this is revealed to be a collection of documents with microscopically-reduced writing. escaping from the witches, who follow the worship of the cult of einstein, they attend a great philosophical convention. using an experimental microscope being demonstrated at the convention, the documents reveal information about the origins of kforri, validating the truth of the anti-evolutionists. they further show that kforri gained its name from that given by the discovering expedition (k40 became kforri), and that the expedition members disagreed and dispersed. they eventually formed nations with cultures and languages derived from their native ones. the name of the island of mnaen, for instance, was based on the earthly manhattan. using the documents, the inhabitants of kforri rapidly advance their technology. they eventually hope to build spaceships to travel back to earth. ||| 5 ||| 5

for the first seven chapters, queen of the martian catacombs and the secret of sinharat are almost word-for-word identical; the differences are inconsequential to the plot. in chapter 1, a brief paragraph is inserted to situate the reader in the leigh brackett solar system and to excuse the presence of non-terran humans on planets like mars through the concept of a prehistoric "seeding" - not mentioned elsewhere in brackett's novels. in chapter 5, an explicit reference to the events of brackett's story the beast-jewel of mars (planet stories, winter 1948) has been cut, perhaps on the assumption that readers of the novel would not know or be interested in the earlier story. the arabic word khamsin is consistently replaced by "storm wind", perhaps on the grounds that readers might not be familiar with the word (or mistake it for a martian technical term). *chapter 1 - eric john stark, fleeing from venus where he has been running guns to native opponents of a terro-venusian mining concern (mining and mineral extraction companies recur as villains in brackett's stories), has come to mars to fight as a mercenary in a private war in the martian drylands on behalf of delgaun, lord of the martian city of valkis. he is finally pinned down by agents of earth police control. their leader, simon ashton, offers him a deal: lifting of his sentence, if he agrees to act as a spy on delgaun, whom ashton claims is plotting a major war together with a barbarian leader called kynon, of the dryland tribe of shun; a war that ashton says will be disastrous for the drylanders. stark agrees to go to valkis as ashton's agent, and return to report to him in the martian city of tarak. *chapter 2 - stark enters valkis late at night and sees the drylanders gathering there. he meets delgaun and several other mercenaries that delgaun has hired. one of them is luhar, an old enemy of stark from venus. they challenge each other, but delgaun separates them. at dawn, kynon of shun enters valkis. *chapter 3 - delgaun, stark and the mercenaries go to see kynon. in the public square of valkis, kynon demonstrates a technology which he claims to have recovered from the lost secrets of the ramas, an ancient race of martians who had acquired a form of immortality. kynon, using two crystal circlets and a glowing rod, appears to transfer the consciousness of an old martian man into a young terran boy. the old man collapses and dies. kynon returns with delgaun and the others to the council room in the palace. *chapter 4 - stark accuses kynon of an elaborate charade in which the boy was coached in his part and the old man was killed by poison. kynon admits it, but justifies it as a necessity for uniting the drylanders against the city-states of the dryland borders, who are depriving them of water resources. together with the men of valkis and the other low-canal cities, they will conquer the city-states and become fully independent of terra. stark goes to his quarters and sleeps through the day. at dusk he goes to the council-room, and finds delgaun there with kynon's female companion, berild. delgaun asks stark to bring back one of kynon's trusted captains, freka, who is indulging in "a certain vice"; he needs to be back before kynon sets out at midnight for his desert headquarters. on his way, stark is stopped by fianna, berild's serving girl, who warns him that he is going into a trap set by delgaun. stark accepts the warning, but continues anyway. *chapter 5 - stark comes to kala's, a broken-down dive in a mostly uninhabited part of valkis. he finds freka there, indulging in shanga, a radiation-induced temporary atavistic regression to a bestial state. stark realizes that an empty room near freka probably contains the trap set for him. when he is refused entrance to the room, he leaves kala's and waits outside. he is followed by luhar, who had been waiting in the empty room for a chance to attack stark. stark jumps luhar; the fighting goes back into kala's, where the shanga addicts and kala herself become involved. stark knocks freka out, is stabbed by luhar, knocks luhar out, and returns with freka to delgaun's palace. delgaun is surprised and angry; berild is pleased. *chapter 6 - at midnight, kynon leaves valkis with the drylanders and mercenaries. kynon orders stark and luhar to remain apart from each other. delgaun remains behind. luhar and freka confer. the caravan proceeds across the desert for three days, and on the fourth day they are hit by a sandstorm. *chapter 7 - luhar and freka take advantage of the storm to jump stark and leave him for dead. he finds himself together with berild. when the storm blows out, they are lost in the desert. they proceed on foot. after four days, running out of water, they come to a wilderness of rocks. from chapter 8 on the two versions diverge. *chapter 8 - stark and berild are dying of thirst. berild leads stark three miles out of their way to a ruined monastery. she miraculously discovers a long-buried well. after they have drunk and slept, stark suggests to berild that she is actually a surviving immortal rama, and knew the location of the well from memory. berild dismisses the accusation. they stay in the ruins two days, and then leave. *chapter 9 - stark and berild arrive at sinharat, the old city of the ramas, where kynon has made his headquarters. they find kynon's army and his mercenaries camped in the desert outside the city. stark enters sinharat looking for luhar, and fatally attacks him when he finds him. delgaun is also mysteriously there. kynon arrests stark and places him in a subterranean cell in sinharat under freka's guard. before freka can kill stark, fianna appears and shoots him. stark disposes of freka in a pit in the catacombs. fianna explains that delgaun and berild are both ramas, and that while kynon wants empire, delgaun and berild want to control mars - without kynon - through their mercenary outlander clients. *chapter 10 - stark and fianna proceed to a crypt below sinharat where berild is waiting. kynon is there with her, but drugged and under berild's hypnotic control. berild offers to become stark's lover and to make him a rama, by exchanging his mind with kynon's, and disposing of delgaun after the war. stark agrees, and berild produces the real crowns of the ramas, and puts them on stark's and kynon's heads. *chapter 11 - stark awakes to find himself in kynon's body. his own body is still there, alive but with kynon's mind still under hypnosis. berild locks kynon, in stark's body, in a small cell. stark-as-kynon goes with berild to address the armies assembled at sinharat from a high ledge in the city. delgaun is there. instead of leading them to war, stark reveals the charade of the false rama crowns. berild stabs stark in the back. stark reveals berild's treachery to delgaun. delgaun throws berild from the ledge and attempts to unseat stark from his steed and flee. stark, though wounded, grasps delgaun and throttles him, while delgaun stabs him repeatedly. stark kills delgaun and loses consciousness. fianna runs to him. *chapter 12 - stark awakes and finds himself with fianna. he is back in the crypt below sinharat, in his own body. kynon is next to him, dead. fianna reveals that she is also a rama, unknown to berild and delgaun. she expresses remorse for her past evil and destroys the rod and crowns of the ramas. stark and fianna leave together and find sinharat deserted. fianna decides to stay in sinharat for a while before she decides what to do. stark departs for tarak to meet simon ashton. *chapter 8 - stark and berild are dying of thirst. berild leads stark three miles out of their way to an old ruin, where they both collapse. at night, stark wakes to see berild tracing her steps to the site of a long-buried well. they uncover it together, drink, and sleep. the next night, stark suggests to berild that she must be a witch to have discovered the well. berild explains that she knew the secret of the well's location from her father, who had crossed the desert in this place years ago. stark accepts her explanation, but is privately unconvinced. they stay in the ruins two days, and then leave. *chapter 9 - stark and berild arrive at sinharat at dawn and find kynon's caravan encamped outside. the dryland armies have not yet arrived, but only kynon and his mercenaries are in the city itself, which the drylanders regard as taboo. stark and berild enter sinharat looking for luhar, but kynon prevents stark and luhar from fighting. berild kills luhar with a knife. kynon does not punish berild, but warns stark not to fight with freka, who has gone back to the desert, and condemns the infighting that threatens his plans. berild lies to kynon about how she and stark reached sinharat, pretending that they had more water than they did. kynon dismisses berild and stark. *chapter 10 - stark awakes at dusk and finds fianna there. she warns him that his life is in danger from delgaun, when he arrives. stark refuses to flee. fianna leads stark to a chamber where berild is waiting. she warns him against delgaun, and expresses her resentment at kynon. drums beat announcing the late arrival of delgaun and his allies to sinharat, and stark and berild part. as stark leaves, he meets fianna, who hints that berild may be a rama. *chapter 11 - kynon unveils the banner of the ramas before the massed armies of the drylands and the low-canals in front of sinharat. stark confronts delgaun as a fellow-follower of kynon, and forces delgaun to accept him as comrade-in-arms. later, in council, delgaun backs down before kynon, and they proceed to plot the conquest of the city-states. kynon warns his confederates not to reveal that they do not really have the secret of the ramas. days pass. freka returns from shun with more fighters, but kynon keeps him and stark from fighting. later, stark goes into sinharat and finds berild reading an ancient wall-inscription in an unknown language. stark follows her as she goes to a high window. *chapter 12 - stark accuses berild of being a rama. berild dismisses his statement with smooth explanations, but stark does not accept them. stark deduces that delgaun must also be a rama. berild leaves suddenly. stark goes later, and is attacked by freka who is under the influence of shanga. as they are fighting, kynon and his fighters discover them. stark is accused of murdering freka, and the shunni demand his blood. stark is knocked out as he tries to blurt out the truth of kynon's charade. he awakes in an underground cell, guarded by a shunni warrior. (this portion of the expansion is a rewrite of the middle of chapter 9 of catacombs.) *chapter 13 - fianna appears, shoots the shunni, and frees stark. fianna reveals that she, berild, and delgaun are all surviving ramas, though she is dependent upon them for the sending-on of minds. she leads him into the catacombs, where stark disposes of the guard's body in a pit and takes his sword. fianna describes delgaun and berild's plans for empire, and explains that they intend to dispose of kynon by putting delgaun's mind into kynon's body. she asks stark to help her prevent it, and leads him to berild's chamber. there they find kynon in bonds, and berild preparing the real crowns of the ramas for the sending-on of minds. *chapter 14 - stark enters, attacks delgaun and kills him with the sword. berild drops the crowns and draws a knife. fianna frees kynon, who throttles berild as she slashes him. stark tells the wounded kynon to stop the march of the drylanders. he and fianna help kynon out to the open stairway that leads up to sinharat. from there, kynon addresses the tribes, telling them of delgaun and berild's treachery and his own lie about having the secret of the ramas. then he collapses and dies. the mercenaries and the armies break up and leave. stark returns to sinharat and finds fianna. she explains that she has hidden the crowns of the ramas, unable to destroy them. she invites stark to return to sinharat late in his life, offering to make him a rama then. he refuses. fianna says that she will stay in sinharat. stark departs for tarak to meet simon ashton, looking back at sinharat as he goes. ||| 5 ||| 2
night and day begins with the investigation of a middle school principal accused of molestation. several girls accuse principal betsy ingersoll of making them pull their dresses up so she can see their panties. the principal claims that she did this to ensure they were wearing proper attire for the school dance. she also claims that her job is not only to ensure they get a proper education, but that they also grow into proper ladies and do not become sluts. she sends several girls home for wearing slutty panties. although there is no crime to charge her with, jesse determines to make trouble for her until he can find something to charge her with as he is convinced the girls’ civil rights were violated. he begins interviewing the principal along with her high powered attorney husband, as well as the girls. later one of the girls comes to see jesse at his office. she tells him that her parents are swingers, and often host parties for that purpose at their home. she and her little brother hate it and she asks jesse if he can help. with swinging not illegal, jesse finds his hands tied, but decides to investigate anyway. he has suit talk to two of the women, one of whom he knew in high school, to get more information on the swingers club. suit discovers that the girl’s mother is not into it, but only does it because her husband wants to. jesse has spike threaten her husband about the swinging, and she later leaves him. the main plot of the novel involves the investigation of the night hawk. the night hawk starts as a peeping tom, and the paradise police get several calls about him. later the night hawk escalates his voyeuristic attacks by breaking into homes while women are home alone, forcing them to undress at gunpoint, and then taking nude photos of them. he then begins writing jesse detailing his exploits, and includes the nude photos. he writes that he cannot stop himself; he must discover these women’s “secret.” he also writes that he does not know what he will do next and fears that he will escalate further. jesse begins to combine his investigation of the swingers with his investigation of the night hawk. since the night hawk never touches anyone, he questions the swingers to find out if there is anyone in their club that only likes to watch and never touch. the women in the club all identify seth ralston. ralston is a professor of english at a nearby university. he is married to a young grad student who is working on her doctorate. jesse discovers that ralston's wife used to teach a wednesday night class, which corresponds with all the peeping tom reports. he also discovers that the peeping tom reports stopped at the same time that ralston’s wife quit her teaching job to begin doing her doctoral work full time. jesse questions ralston’s wife about the swinging to see if she will inadvertently reveal something about her husband that will confirm he is the night hawk, and even hints to her that her husband may be the night hawk. she responds by belittling jesse for being a dumb cop, and singling them out for their lifestyle. meanwhile jesse continues to pressure betsy ingersoll, who then reports that she is a victim of the night hawk. soon after jesse receives a nude photo of betsy, however he and molly become convinced that she is posing in the photo and suspect the attack was staged. the local media request an interview concerning the attack, and jesse uncharacteristically agrees. he gives details of the attack and later receives a letter from the night hawk who demands that he never attacked betsy ingersoll. jesse believes that the night hawk is telling the truth, as he has never denied an attack before, but always been honest about his attacks. jesse confronts betsy with this and she admits that she staged the attack. she says that she did it to get some attention from her husband, but that he did not even care. she was acting out because her husband cheats on her constantly with young women, which also explains her obsession with teenage girls not growing up to be sluts. jesse agrees not to charge her with any crimes if she agrees to see sunny randall’s shrink, dr. silverman (the long-term love interest of another parker character spenser), which she does. a few days later seth ralston’s wife comes to jesse to report that her husband is missing. they begin searching for him, and soon after jesse receives another letter from the night hawk blasting him for speaking with his wife, and ruining his life. he writes that he is going to leave town, but only after he discovers one more woman’s secret, as he calls it, and warns that this woman will be someone close to jesse. jesse thinks that he is trying to hint that the woman will be betsy ingersoll, but jesse believes he is actually targeting molly. they set a police unit in front of betsy’s house as a decoy, but then stake out molly’s house. molly waits at home with a gun strapped to her thigh, and a wire so jesse can hear her. the night hawk breaks in on her and forces her to begin stripping at gun point. suit and jesse then break in to arrest him. surprised that they figured out he was after molly, he raises his gun to shoot her, but molly, suit, and jesse all shoot and kill seth ralston, putting an end to the night hawk. suit is left with a moral dilemma that it was his shot that killed ralston, but since all three fired, jesse is able to disfuse the situation by convincing suit that it could have been any one of the three. ||| 1 ||| 7
the following synopsis of some of the major points in eve's seed is based on information contained in the book's official website. *because men cannot compete with women’s capabilities in the crucial realms of reproduction and nourishing offspring, mcelvaine argues, men generally seek to avoid a single standard of human behavior and achievement. they create separate definitions of “manliness” which are based on a false opposition to “womanliness.” a “real man” has been seen in most cultures as “notawoman.” *although this viewpoint actually begins with woman as the “standard” human and proceeds to define man by its supposed vast differences from that standard, people do not like to see themselves in negative terms, so men have generally sought ways to transform woman into a negative, thus making man positive. *human life—and the situation of both sexes—was radically changed about 10,000 years ago by the invention of agriculture, which in all likelihood was accomplished by women. *in one of his most striking contentions, mcelvaine says that the story of adam and eve in the third chapter of book of genesis is an allegory for the invention of agriculture by women (eve’s eating from the tree of knowledge) and its long-term consequences (the loss of what seemed in distant retrospect to have been a pre-agricultural paradise in which people lived easily, without work, simply picking fruit from trees, and man having to go forth and till the soil to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow). the “fall of man” is a metaphor for an actual fall of men. *mcelvaine says that the development of methods for the intentional production of food (animal herding as well as agriculture) substantially devalued what men had traditionally done. hunting was no longer needed and defense against other species declined in importance as groups of humans settled in growing numbers in farming areas into which predators ventured less frequently than their paths had crossed those of human hunter-gatherers. *the loss of value in their traditional roles left men adrift, seeking new meaningful roles, and increasingly resentful of women. the result was what can accurately be seen as a neolithic and early bronze age backlash or “masculinist movement.” *at this point, mcelvaine argues, there arose an almost irresistible metaphor, the very widespread acceptance of which has misshaped human life through all of recorded history. the apparent analogy of a seed being planted in furrowed soil to a male’s “planting” of semen in the vulva of a female led to the conclusion that men provide the seed of new life and women constitute the soil in which that seed grows. this seed metaphor, which mcelvaine calls "the conception misconception," has remained with us throughout history and it continues to mislead us in profound ways down to the present. *the woman-made world of agriculture had, paradoxically, become a man's world to a degree unprecedented in human existence. as mcelvaine puts it: "hell hath no fury like a man devalued." *the belief that men have procreative power led inevitably to the conclusion that the supreme creative power must also be male. the toxic fruit that grew from the seed metaphor, mcelvaine says, was male monotheism. *the combination of the belief that god (or the god who is the ultimate creator) is male with the notion that humans are created in god's image yielded the inescapable conclusion that men are closer than women to godly perfection. thus the line from the misconceptions about conception emanating from the seed metaphor to the belief, given its classic expressions by aristotle, aquinas, and freud, that women are deformed or “incomplete” men is clear and direct. *once the seed metaphor had sprouted into the idea that god is male and so women are inferior, the original “notawoman” definition of manhood took on new and more menacing implications. now what had been an essentially horizontal division became a clearly vertical one: traits and values associated with women were not simply classified as improper for men, but as inferior. *the total subordination of women throughout recorded history, mcelvaine argues, is but the first part of the devastating legacy of the neolithic backlash and the seed metaphor. equally important has been the concomitant suppression in men of all values, ideas, and characteristics associated with women and so defined as inferior. the rest, he says, is history—pretty much all of it—and, the gains of women in recent decades notwithstanding, these legacies from mistaken ideas in the neolithic age continue to have enormous effects on us today. ||| 4 ||| 4
the year is 2070, and the united republic of america, the authoritarian conservative regime constructed after the fall of the united states, has built its first starship: the urss alabama. the welcoming celebration for captain robert e. lee takes a sudden turn when lee initiates his plan to steal the alabama. working with a handful of conspirators, lee manages to take the ship by the helm and override the clearance codes. urs soldiers climb aboard to stop lee, but they are too late. not wishing to abandon their orders, colonel reese and the other soldiers become stowaways. captain lee knew exactly what he was doing. his destination: the 47 ursae majoris system, some 46 light years away—far enough to escape the tyrannical united republic. at a cruise velocity of .2c, alabama would not arrive at its destination until 230 earth years have passed. so the crew of 104 soldiers, scientists, and civilians were put in biostasis, to be awakened from their virtual immortality by the ship’s ai 226 years into the future. (four years are spared due to time dilation.) 47 ursae majoris' system has four planets- named fox, raven, bear and wolf after native american mythology. bear has six satellites- dog, hawk, eagle, coyote, snake and goat. of these six, coyote is large enough to support its own biosphere. just three months into the journey, something goes terribly wrong. leslie gillis, the senior communications officer, is awakened from biostasis. expecting the year to be 2300, gillis is horrified when he questions the ai. there was a mix up, and now it is impossible for gillis to return to his dreamless sleep. his grueling options are either suicide or a lonely existence surviving off the ship’s supplies. while suicide may be more honorable than devouring the crewmate’s rations, gillis chooses life. after a brief chat with the ai, gillis learns that a mr. eric gunther was originally scheduled to awake three months into the trip. gunther is an agent for the ura, and would attempt to contact the president, or destroy the ship. the program was changed at the last minute to wake someone else instead- les gillis. gillis leaves a note for captain lee explaining gunther’s plans for treason. why they were changed at the last minute remains a mystery, but it was a change that would cost gillis his life. during leslie gillis’ solitary life, he did everything he could to keep from going insane, attempting to eat and sleep at regular hours, reading all of the books which were on board, playing chess against the ai, writing stories, and painting. using practically all of the ship’s art supplies, gillis created a story about a prince named rupurt and the fantastic alien world he lived in. he painted scenes of his books on the ship’s inside walls. eventually, gillis died in his old age with a fall from the main ladder, after trying to get a better look at the alien ship he had seen. the ai automatically expelled his body into space with the arms of a maintenance bot, and the ship sailed on to 47 ursae majoris with no more incidents. the crew is awakened as planned in the year 2300. the alabama has entered the 47 ursae majoris system and is approaching its third planet, bear. bear (currently known as 47 ursae majoris b) is a gas giant that orbits 47 ursae majoris at 2.1 aus and coyote, its fourth moon, is larger even than mars. this habitable satellite is lush with green plants and rivers of water. this will be the crew’s new home. captain lee directs the landing procedures of the two ships docked to the alabama, the wallace and the helms. the crew finds coyote to be habitable, but very peculiar nevertheless. coyote’s seasons change at a much slower pace than earth’s. a year for coyote consists of 1,096 days with 27 hours per day. life forms on coyote seem similar to those on earth at first glance, but behave in unique ways. as described in gillis’ novel, the world is home to gigantic bird-like creatures which are anything but friendly. using gillis’ term for the beasts, boids are common in the grasslands around the new settlement. the remainder of coyote tells of the adventures of carlos and wendy along the banks of the equatorial river which stretches around coyote. ||| 5 ||| 5

dr. conway must deal with an unconscious patient, classification elph, who may be a cannibal or a demigod, or both. it came from the "other galaxy", and the species is well known, almost infamous, to the ians, who are also from another galaxy. it is extremely long-lived, and regularly takes complete rejuvenation treatments, including the brain and memory, to keep itself young. by doing this, it is practically immortal. it, although unconscious, appeared to have the ability to negate the most powerful drugs and resist surgery to cure its skin condition. this later turned out to be the work of the entity's "doctor", who is an intelligent, organized collection of microscopic, virus-type cells. once doctor conway realizes this, he uses a wooden stake to make the elph's doctor focus itself in one small location, at which time it is removed from the elph, informed regarding the physiology-problems of its patient, and put back in. the patient, whose name is lonvellin, quickly makes a full recovery, and it leaves to do what it does best: bona fide missions that involve taking backwards planetary cultures and pulling them up "by their bootstraps". his particular mission, this time, is to cure a diseased planet called etla, and he recruits dr. conway and the "monitor corps" to help him. when the empire that controls the planet of etla misinterprets lonvellin's efforts as an act of war, the empire declares war on the sector general space hospital. conway helps organise the evacuation of most of the station's staff and patients, and following the death or injury of more senior staff, becomes the most senior surviving physician. after a brutal series of attacks, and with the hospital on the brink of defeat, a group of federation and empire soldiers convince conway to help in a mutiny against the federation commander dermod. the empire soldiers had been told that the federation had attacked etla, rather than trying to help it, but seeing the way all casualties were treated equally on the station, and in particular witnessing conway breaking down after failing to save the life of an alien empire soldier, convinced them that they had been lied to. ||| 5 ||| 5

the premise is that arthur's youth, not dealt with in malory, was a time when he was tutored by merlyn to prepare him for the use of power and royal life. merlyn magically turns wart into various animals at times. he also has more human adventures, at one point meeting the outlaw robin hood, (who is referred to in the novel as robin wood). the setting is loosely based on medieval england, and in places it incorporates white's considerable knowledge of medieval culture (as in relation to hunting, falconry and jousting). however it makes no attempt at consistent historical accuracy, and incorporates some obvious anachronisms (aided by the concept that merlyn lives backwards in time rather than forwards, unlike everyone else). ||| 2 ||| 5

on a trip to turin to analyse the shroud of turin, journalist decker hawthorne and professor harry goodman discover human dermal cells remaining. after the trip, goodman takes some samples back to his laboratory, in the united states, and discovers that they are still alive. he then invites decker to show him his discoveries. once decker arrives, goodman explains several of his theories about the cells, and has engineered a strain of "c cells" which are incredibly resiliant to damage and disease. goodman is actively searching for ways these c cells could be implemented to insert into ones body to cure disease, due to their strange properties and signs of immortality. then the professor proposes to decker the idea of cloning the cells, but decker does not support this idea. some years pass and decker visits professor goodman with one of his two daughters. while hawthorne and goodman talk for some time, decker's daughter meets and interacts with the goodman's adopted son, christopher. on the way back home, decker deduces christopher's origin. he immediately returns to goodman's home and confronts him about christopher being the clone of jesus christ. goodman explains that christopther is like any usual boy, but that he shows a high degree of intelligence and has never suffered from disease of any kind. he convinces decker not to do a story or christopher's life will be ruined. before leaving, decker assumes out loud that goodman named the child "christopher" because of jesus christ, of whom he was cloned; but the professor rapidly corrects him, claiming that he named him in name of christopher colombus, since he believed that the child would usher the world into a new era. several years later, decker visits israel on business and stays with old friends, joshua and ilyana rosen. there he learns lots of things about the historical place and its notable culture. during his visit, decker receives an anonymous phone call saying that "dogs will cry, but their tears will find no place to land" following the shootings of several palestinians by israeli troops in a riot. he immediately calls the police and they tell him that the call must have come from muslim terrorists, making a threat of some kind of massacre or attack against the jews (to which the callers referred to as "the dogs"), but they remain uncertain about where they plan to attack. decker realizes that the terrorists who called him were referring to the wailing wall when they said that the jews tears would have "no place to land". he rushes to the historical site, just in time to watch it blow up entirely. he saves a young boy from being killed by the blast. in retaliation for the destruction of the western wall, israel destroys the dome of the rock and retake the temple mount. decker later goes to check on the boy, but he is kidnapped by terrorists, along with his companion journalist and long time friend and confidant, tom donafin. they are held captive in an unknown building in lebanon. he and tom remain imprisoned for three years. decker and tome escape, after one day decker had a dream of christopher goodman, who leads him to the exit. in the dream his captors are dispatched and lie throughout the building. decker reminds the dream christopher that tom was also held prisoner, and christopher absent-mindedly shows decker where he is. upon waking decker discovers that his door is unlocked and his captures were dispatched in the same fashion as in his dream, and tom was right where christopher had shown him. decker and tom then make their escape into the countryside where they are rescued by united nations troops under none other than the secretary general, jon hansen, with whom decker forms an instant friendship and bond. they are housed temporarily in israel, which is under attack by russians, until it is safe for them to fly home. transport is arranged for them to get out of the besieged city, however a dog-fight in progress causes tom and decker to exit the car to document the duel and tom tries to get pictures. the car, the driver and tom are hit by a blast from one of the fighter planes. decker survives, and tom is assumed dead. it is revealed the tom, however does not die. he is stricken blind, however, from the explosion and from flying glass. decker is informed that tom's body was never found and he is presumed dead. decker is finally reunited with his family, and they return to the united states while decker recovers from captivity. during his recovery period, there is a worldwide catastrophe that seemingly has no explanation. millions of people wake up next to dead loved ones, and often whole families have died. this event is called "the disaster" by most people, however sudden converts to christianity begin to call it the rapture. decker's entire family, along with his friends abroad, the rosens, perish in the tragedy. some collateral damage was also suffered, as people driving cars suddenly die and continue out of control, as well as some commercial airline pilots and others. decker buries his family, and then falls into a catatonic stupor as the weight of his loss consumes him. later christopher goodman arrives at decker's house explaining that his adoptive parents died in a plane crash piloted by a casualty of the disaster. decker shakes off his catatonia and invites christopher to stay with him, and christopher becomes his new family. jon hansen offers decker a position as his assistant at the united nations, where christopher encounters robert milner, a retired secretary general who is heavily involved in occult practices, and recognizes christopher as one who has been prophesied in new age councils to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity and enhanced consciousness for mankind. alice bernley (a thinly veiled reference to alice bailey - an actual noted theosophist), a confidant of milner's also sees and recognizes christopher and they befriend him, and milner assumes the role of mentor to christopher, not only in politics, but in a worldwide new age movement. meanwhile, jon hansen has been working on an ambitious project to reorganize the united nations to better handle operations, and in light of the recent disaster (the rapture), he has almost open reign to do what he sees necessary. the un is restructured with a central government led by the secretary general, and ten regional divisions which include oceania and asia, europe, africa and the middle east, the americas, etc. each of these regions is led by a primary regent who is backed up by an alternate who serves as proxy when the primary is absent. israel is the only nation on earth that refuses to join the un. they refuse to join because their regional partners are all arab nations that will force them into a position that is extremely unfavorable and lacking represenation within the un. meanwhile, christian fundamentalists, citing various prophecies in the biblical book of revelation, identify hansen as the antichrist or "the beast". this, however, quickly ends as jon hansen tragically dies when his helicopter crashes in pakistan during a fact finding mission. the office of secretary general falls vacant, and remains vacant. none of the ten regents believe there was anyone to be a suitable replacement for the extremely charismatic, popular and altruistic hansen. a rotation schedule is established where each primary regent serves as acting secretary general for a month. it is deemed that this cycle will continue until a unanimous agreement can be made for hansen's replacement. unanimous consent is proven to be almost impossible. years pass, and christopher has been elected as the european alternate regent. under the tutelage of milner and bailey christopher has embraced his spiritual nature, as well as decker who has provided him with pragmatic and political guidance. under machinations of milner and with the cooperation of various groups such as freemasons and the knights templar with the funding from an occult clearinghouse known as the lucius trust (a thinly veiled reference to the lucis trust), christopher comes into possession of the ark of the covenant. he gives the ark to israel as a gift. and in exchange he wants israel to sign a treaty with the un. a seven year treaty is signed promising israel that they will not be impeded by their neighbors, and un recognizes their right to exist. when it is proven that the ark is authentic - proven as alice bernley dies from looking inside - israel agrees, joins the united nations, and the ark is placed in the new temple that was built on the temple mount (previously retaken by israel after the destruction of the wailing wall). albert faure (renamed to albert moore in later printings), an extremely aggressive and deft manipulator - as well as the primary regent of europe - sets in motion a plan that he hopes will gain him the position of secretary general. meanwhile, christopher, following a spirit guide sets off into the desert for guidance after a series of extremely unsettling dreams about god and an impending feeling of global doom. when christophers journey into the desert nears its completion (after 40 days and 40 nights), milner leads decker to the desert where he says they will encounter christopher who will need their assistance. christopher's "vision quest" has revealed faure's plan to him, and he intends to stop it. however they learn that christopher is too late, because faure's plan has already culminated in several strategic assassinations, as well as the declaration and execution of the china-india-pakistan war, a nuclear conflict that lasts a single day, yet ends with hundreds of millions of casualties. no clear winner was declared or recognized in this war, however moore uses incident to catapult himself into a position of power, at which time he forces a vote for secretary general. he expects unanimous consent due to bribery, force, blackmail and threats against the other regents, and he is widely expected to win. just as the vote for secretary general is under way, christopher shows up at the united nations and announces that faure was responsible for the assassinations and is the single man who is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions in the china-india-pakistan war. faure denies this, but christopher insists, and commands faure to confess. seemingly under the power of christopher goodman, faure does confess, and then immediately drops dead in front of every one at the united nations. it is concluded that faure died under the weight of his own guilt, but decker and robert milner realize that christopher has extraordinary powers and he was beginning to exercise them. ||| 5 ||| 2
; chapter 1 : the story starts with a violent swordfight between the barbarian grignr and some soldiers. grignr is on his way to gorzom in search of wenches and plunder. ; chapter 2 : grignr arrives in gorzom and goes to a tavern, where he picks up a local wench (with a "lithe, opaque nose"). a drunken guard challenges him over the woman; he kills the guard, but is arrested by the man's companions and brought before the local prince, who (on the advice of his advisor) condemns him to a life of forced labour in the mines. this chapter contains the first of several occasions when the word slut is applied to a man, presumably as an insult. ; chapter 3 : grignr sits despondent in his cell, thinking of his homeland. ; chapter 3½ : a scene of a pagan ritual involving a group of shamans, a young woman to be sacrificed and a jade idol with one eye: a "many fauceted scarlet emerald", the eye of argon. ; chapter 4 : grignr sits bored and anguished in his cell and is losing track of time. he battles a large rat and it inspires him with a plan, involving the corpse of the rat. ; chapter 5 : the pagan ritual proceeds, with a priest ordering the young woman up to the altar. when she fails to proceed, he attempts to grope her. she disables him with a hard kick between the testicles, but the other shamans grab and molest her. ; chapter 6 : grignr is taken from his cell by two soldiers. he takes the rat pelvis he has fashioned into a dagger and slits one soldier's throat. he then strangles the second and takes his clothes. he wanders the catacombs for a time, finding a storeroom, and narrowly avoids being killed by a booby-trap. below this room he finds the palace mausoleum. he resets the booby-trap in case he is being pursued. :he hears a scream apparently coming from a sarcophagus. he opens it to find the scream is coming from below. he opens a trap door and sees a shaman about to sacrifice the young woman. he ploughs into the group of shamans with an axe and takes the eye. the young woman, carthena, turns out to be the tavern wench. they depart. ; chapter 7 : one priest, who had been suffering an epileptic seizure during grignr's attack, recovers, draws a scimitar and follows grignr and carthena through the trap door in the ceiling. ; chapter 7½ : the priest strikes at grignr but he triggers, and is killed by, the reset booby-trap before his sword can connect. carthena tells grignr of the prince, agaphim, who had condemned him to the mines. they encounter agaphim and kill him, as well as his advisor agafnd. :they emerge into the sunlight. grignr pulls the eye of argon out of his pouch to admire. the jewel melts and turns into a writhing blob with a leechlike mouth. the blob attacks him and begins sucking his blood. carthena faints. grignr, beginning to lose consciousness, grabs a torch and thrusts it into the blob's mouth. traditional photocopied and internet versions end at this point, incomplete since page 49 of the fanzine had been lost. the ending was rediscovered in 2004 and published in the new york review of science fiction #198, february 2005. the authenticity of this "lost ending" is still disputed by many. ; the lost ending (remainder of ch. 7½) : the blob explodes into a thousand pieces, leaving nothing behind except "a dark red blotch upon the face of the earth, blotching things up." grignr and the still-unconscious carthena ride off into the distance. the version usually found on the internet is incomplete, ending with the phrase "-end of available copy-". susan stepney claims to have the missing ending section, including information on how the lost ending was discovered. quoting from that page: for the history of this great work, including the eventual discovery of the legendary lost ending, see new york review of science fiction #195, november 2004, and #198, february 2005. ansible, langford's science-fiction newsletter, reports in its february 2005 issue that "according to a letter in the new york review of science fiction (january 2005), a complete copy of the relevant 1970 fanzine has been unearthed in the jack williamson sf library at eastern new mexico university. jwsfl collection administrator gene bundy reports that the long-missing page 49 begins: "with a sloshing plop the thing fell to the ground, evaporating in a thick scarlet cloud until it reatained its original size.'..." because the novelette was at least once re-typed and photocopied for distribution, without provenance, many readers have found it hard to believe the story was not a collaborative effort, a satire on bad writing, or both. the webmaster of a now defunct site called "wulf's 'eye of argon' shrine" argued that the story "was actually well paced and plotted. he went on to say that, although he didn't believe it himself, 'at least one sf professional today claims that the story was a cunning piece of satire passed off as real fan fiction.'" langford reported the following, sent in by author michael swanwick, in ansible #193: :i had a surprising conversation at readercon with literary superstar samuel r. delany, who told me of how at an early clarion the students and teachers had decided to see exactly how bad a story they could write if they put their minds to it. chip himself contributed a paragraph to the round robin effort. its title? "the eye of argon". the 1995 reprint was attributed to "g. ecordian," after the hero, grignr the ecordian. langford considers it well known that theis is the author, and surmises that delany misremembered the event. author stephen goldin said that, during a convention, he met a woman who told him she had done the actual mimeographing for the ozark-area fanzine. lee weinstein reports that he had originally heard that dorothy fontana had distributed the photocopies. weinstein, however, later discovered usenet posts by richard w. zellich, who was involved in running the st. louis, missouri area convention archon. zellich reported in 1991 posts that jim theis was real and attended the convention for years. what weinstein calls "the smoking gun...the long missing citation" was a 1994 posting from new york fan richard newsome, who transcribed an interview with theis published in osfan #13. theis was quoted as saying, "how many professional writers have written a complete story at so early an age? even so, 'eye of argon' isn't great. i basically don't know much about structure or composition." the interviewer praised him for showing good sportsmanship, and theis replied, "i mean, it was easier than showing bad character and inviting trouble." ||| 2 ||| 2
james tock was born on a stormy night in snow county hospital in colorado...and at the exact moment his grandfather, josef tock, a pastry chef, dies of a stroke. though crippled by a stroke earlier in the week, moments before his death, josef recovers miraculously to impart on his son rudy ten cryptic predictions: the boy would be born at 10:46 pm, weigh 8 pounds, 10 ounces, be 20 inches long and be born with syndactyly. josef also predicts five terrible days to come in his grandson's life. he names each, though not why they are so terrible, and rudy dutifully notes them on the back of a free circus pass given to him by a police officer friend. coherent though bizarre his speech may be, josef tock does not recover from his event, but expires right when the baby is born. earlier in the evening, rudy tock made the acquaintance of a strange man, konrad beezo. beezo is a clown for the very circus tock's pass is for, and is a fitful, spiteful, creepy, chain smoking individual half in his clown costume. his wife natalie, a trapeze artist of some renown and born of a good family, is lying in childbirth, says he, and her relatives have virtually disowned her for marrying him. he speaks glowingly of his soon-to-be-born son, who is to be named "punchinello", and will carry on the fine tradition of clowning. he speaks venomously of his father-in-law, using many colorful epithets. tock is only too grateful to leave beezo and attend to his father...however, the grief for his father's death was short-lived. beezo, upon learning natalie died in childbirth, goes insane ranting about her family sending assassins to kill her and begins shooting, killing a doctor and a nurse. tock, in perhaps the one moment of heroism in his meek baker's life, convinces the mad clown his enemies have left, and momentarily quells his anger. beezo leaves, his son punchinello swaddled in his arms... but drops a cliffhanger: "i'll never forget you, rudy tock. never." as his late grandfather predicted, jimmy tock is twenty inches long, 8 lb. 10 oz, and has syndactyly; a fusing of the digits at birth a problem that is corrected with minor surgery. jimmy tock writes the book, a loose autobiography of personal experience, reminisces, and second- or even third-hand accounts of events, transcribing it from a series of tapes on the eve of his fifth and final terrible day. the narrative is given in an often self-deprecating, comically understated manner. however, certain experiences stand out starkly, most noticeably blundering into a harrowing, yet almost surreal, bank robbery by a trio of plastique-wielding crazed history buff clowns led by none other than punchinello beezo--in which jimmy gradually realizes he's falling for a comely fellow hostage (on the first predicted date)--and a dangerous game of chicken with a severely disturbed stalker on an icy road the night his wife lorrie--the former fellow hostage--is about to deliver their first child (on the second predicted date). the man after the tocks is none other than konrad beezo himself, looking for retribution for his imprisoned, and accidentally-gelded son. his mad obsession with the family frames both this terrible day (2) and the next predicted day (3)--for beezo desires a male tock child as his prize, a new son to raise in the fine clown tradition. the lunatic will do whatever he must to collect what he believes due him, including numerous facial reconstructive surgeries to assume new identities and escape the grasp of the law. jimmy believes that everyone in the world is tenebrously yet inexorably connected to one another, just as his toes were at birth. this phenomenon is often called "six degrees of separation".(4)--punchinello, who is currently imprisoned, is asked by jimmy and lorrie, who aided in his conviction and sentencing, to donate one of his kidneys to help save the life of annie tock, the daughter of jimmy and lorrie. punchinello only agrees to the donation in return for multiple favors that are frivolous by comparison to the precious kidney. as the deal is about to be complete, punchinello asks that jimmy kills virgilio vivacemente as one last favor. the ensuing chapter(s) are picked up by lorrie, and as he prepares to face the last of his five labors, jimmy reflects on the writing at the bottom of that thirty-year-old ticket on which his life was mapped out: "prepare to be enchanted!", and all the meanings those four red words hold, with both hope and trepidation. as the prophecies are fulfilled one by one, and he survives each, jimmy learns many things about himself--as well as konrad, natalie, punchinello, and konrad's father-in-law, virgilio vivacemente, the vain, sadistic patriarch of the world-famous acrobatic clan who casts his long shadow over the lives of both the tocks and the beezos. some of jimmy's revelations are beautiful; others fearsome; still others shake his meek, lumbering pastry chef's life to the foundation and cause him to reflect on the true meaning of syndactyly--as both an ailment and a life's philosophy. ||| 6 ||| 2
equality 7-2521, writing in a tunnel under the earth, later revealed to be an ancient subway tunnel, explains his background, the society around him, and his emigration. his exclusive use of plural pronouns ("we", "our", "they") to refer to himself and others tells a tale of complete socialization and governmental control. the idea of the world council was to eliminate all individualist ideas. it was so stressed, that people were burned at the stake for saying an unspeakable word ("i", "me", "myself", and "ego"). he recounts his early life. he was raised, like all children in the world of anthem, away from his parents in the home of the infants, then transferred to the home of the students, where he began his schooling. later, he realized that he was born with a "curse": he is eager to think and question, and unwilling to give up himself for others, which violates the principles upon which anthems society is founded. he excelled in math and science, and dreamed of becoming a scholar. however, a council of vocations assigned all people to their jobs, and he was assigned to the home of the street sweepers. equality accepts his profession willingly in order to repent for his transgression (his desire to learn). he works with international 4-8818 and union 5-3992. international is exceptionally tall, a great artist (which is his transgression, as only people chosen to be artists may draw), and equality's only friend (having a friend also being a crime because, in anthems society, one is not supposed to prefer one of one's brothers over the rest). union, "they of the half-brain," suffers from some sort of neurological seizures. however, equality remains curious. one day, he finds the entrance to a subway tunnel in his assigned work area and explores it, despite international 4-8818's protests that an action unauthorized by a council is forbidden. equality realizes that the tunnel is left over from the unmentionable times, before the creation of anthems society, and is curious about it. during the daily three hour-long play, he leaves the rest of the community at the theater and enters the tunnel and undertakes scientific experiments. working outside the city one day, by a field, equality meets and falls in love with a woman, liberty 5-3000, whom he names "the golden one." liberty 5-3000 names equality "the unconquered". continuing his scientific work, equality rediscovers electricity (which he, until the book nears its conclusion, calls the "power of the sky") and the light bulb. he makes a decision to take his inventions to the world council of scholars when they arrive in his town in a few days' time, so that they will recognize his talent and allow him to work with them, as well as to make what he sees as a valuable contribution to his fellow men. however, one night he loses track of time in the underground tunnel and his absence from the home of the street sweepers is noticed. when he refuses to say where he has been, he is arrested and sent to the palace of corrective detention, from which he easily escapes after being tortured. the day after his escape, he walks in on the world council of scholars and presents his work to them. horrified, they reject it because it was not authorized by a council and threatens to upset the equilibrium of their world. when they try to destroy his invention, he takes it and flees into the uncharted forest which lies outside the city. upon entering the uncharted forest, equality begins to realize that he is free, that he no longer must wake up every morning with his brothers to sweep the streets. since it was illegal for men of the city to enter or even think of the forest, he was not pursued once he crossed its threshold. he can "rise, or run, or leap, or fall down again." now that he sees this, he is not stricken with the sense that he will die at the fangs of the beasts of the forest as a result of his transgressions. he develops a new understanding of the world and his place in it. on his second day of living in the forest, equality stumbles upon the golden one, liberty 5-3000, who has followed him from the city. they embrace, struggling to express their feelings for each other as they do not know how to verbally express themselves as individuals. they find and enter a house from the unmentionable times in the mountains, perfectly preserved for hundreds of years by thick overgrowth, and decide to live in it. while reading books from the house's library, equality and liberty discover that the unspeakable word, the one that carries the penalty of death, is "i", given through the power of "ego". recognizing its sacred value and the individuality it expresses, they give themselves new names from the books: equality becomes "prometheus" and liberty becomes "gaea". as the book closes, prometheus talks about the past, wonders how men could give up their individuality, and charts a future in which they will regain it. the last word of the book, "ego", is inscribed by prometheus on a rock and hung over his front door. ||| 5 ||| 5
bobby and courtney arrive on third earth only to find that it has changed quite noticeably. patrick, the local traveler, arrives and takes them to the library to find out about their friend mark, whom they believe is on first earth. startlingly, information pertaining to mark originates from both first earth and second earth. both sources tell of him disappearing. in the flume, on first earth november 1, 1937, courtney and bobby run into a dado (a type of android) in ragged clothing. bobby tells courtney to escape while he fights it off. soon the dado backs into the tunnel and into an oncoming train. the dado is torn in half. bobby takes the pieces to the flume and sends it back to quillan. then bobby goes to first earth to find mark but he knows that ibara needs him so he goes there and leaves courtney behind. bobby is in ibara, the next territory he must save from saint dane's plans. though the people there live simply, by growing or fishing for their food and living in grass huts, there are signs of advanced civilization, including artificial lights and other technological advances. no one, whether out of ignorance or desire to conceal, can explain these anachronisms. bobby meets the jakills, a group of teens outside of the main social group, who are determined to discover the truth of ibara's unusual character. leading them is siry, remudi's son. bobby agrees to join the jakills after proving his skills against a group of flighters (humanoids that attack ibara relentlessly). together the jakills and bobby steal a ship and set off to find the truth. they eventually land in a city known as rubity, a city far away from rayne. bobby, siry, and a few of the jakills explore rubity. after a while, bobby discovers that ibara is a manifest future version of veelox/an island on the territory veelox and that rubity is rubic city, 300 years after bobby failed to stop saint dane from causing chaos there. the flighters attack them as they find this out, however, and only bobby and siry make it back to the ship, which they find is burning. they believe that most of the jakills are killed, apparently leaving only bobby and siry alive. they escape from the enraged flighters, only to meet saint dane in the now abandoned lifelight pyramid. aja killian's journal is interrupted by saint dane. bobby then finds out that the jakills' name comes from aja killian [ajakillian] and that flighters were the people who didn't leave lifelight [lifelighters]. saint dane reveals that he is bringing an army of tens of thousands of dados to ibara to make veelox's second turning point a disaster. bobby and siry barely escape on skimmers, which are high speed boats from cloral, brought by saint dane. the two of them get back to ibara and tell the ruling tribunal what has happened. the tribunal then reveals that the ship that the jakills stole was one of ten ships that they were going to use to repopulate veelox. after sending them out early, the ships are destroyed by flighters, and the threat of the impeding army looms on the horizon. bobby and siry travel to veelox to obtain maps of ibara from aja killian. they then go to zadaa to borrow a dygo, then to denduron in order to unearth the explosive tak. when they leave, the traveler alder goes with them. bobby then goes to quillan alone in order to get the black dado-killing rods for extra protection. after a gigantic battle with archers firing tak at the dados, it appears that the battle is won. when a second wave of dados arrive, bobby throws almost all the tak they have left in an underground tunnel and lures the army over it. as he is about to detonate the tak, saint dane catches up with bobby and has a fight with him, in which he reveals that there is a "king of the territories", and that he wants to be it. when bobby asks who the king is now, saint dane merely says, "and now you see the truth..." siry arrives in time to prevent bobby from being killed, and bobby blows up the tak bomb. the dado army is destroyed but as they begin to celebrate, bobby decides that the time has come to go after saint dane. bobby goes with siry and alder to take the various things they had taken from the other territories back to their places of origin. after they leave, bobby destroys the flume with a tak arrow, trapping both himself and saint dane on ibara. bobby hopes that this means halla is safe. in the final chapter, however, saint dane and his accomplice nevva winter speak on top of the lifelight pyramid. by unearthing the tak, bobby has doomed denduron. just as saint dane had said long ago, denduron would be the first territory to fall. it is revealed that saint dane has more power in realizing the future of halla than thought, and that telleo is actually nevva winter in disguise. ||| 2 ||| 5
when the wealthy and eligible earl of rule proposes marriage to elizabeth winwood, she resigns herself to marrying against her will to rescue the fortunes of her impoverished family. her youngest sister horatia decides to take matters into her own hands, meeting with the earl and convincing him to marry her instead of elizabeth, thus leaving elizabeth free to marry her true (but far less eligible) love. part of the deal she proposes to rule is that she will not interfere with his activities after their marriage. the wedding takes place and, as tacitly agreed upon, the earl continues his association with his mistress, lady caroline massey. horatia quickly becomes a popular and fashionable society wife, spending vast amounts of money on sensational outfits and at gambling on cards. the earl is also obliged to make regular financial donations to support horatia's likeable but debt-ridden brother, pelham. meanwhile, horatia meets and befriends lord lethbridge, who seeks revenge on the earl for his role in thwarting lethbridge's attempts to elope with lady louisa (rule's sister) several years earlier. lethbridge gains horatia's favour by staging a hold-up of horatia's carriage, where he heroically rides up to save her from the highwaymen. the earl warns horatia against continuing her friendship with lethbridge, but when he declines to explain why, horatia disregards his warning. horatia, who wants to teach her husband a lesson, goes to a masked ball that the earl had forbidden her from attending, with lord lethbridge as her escort. having heard that lethbridge is an excellent card player, she attempts to coerce lethbridge into playing with her and he eventually relents, proposing that they play for a lock of her hair. before the game can start, lord rule (who has followed horatia disguised in a domino and mask) steps on horatia's gown, ripping it. while she is away fixing her dress, he incapacitates lethbridge and dresses himself in lethbridge's mask and domino. when horatia returns she doesn't realise her husband has taken lethbridge's place and they begin to play cards. horatia is badly beaten and during the game begins to realise the inappropriateness of her actions. when she gives up the lock of her hair, rule (masquerading as lethbridge) steals a kiss. horatia, furious and indignant, rushes out and bumps into lady massey, who happens to be at the same ball. the next day horatia confesses what happened to rule because she can't bear for him to hear it from lady massey. the earl explains his ruse and horatia decides to end her friendship with lethbridge. rule, discovering that he has fallen for his own wife, sets out to court her. however, not knowing that the earl has broken off his relationship with lady massey, horatia is polite but distant. when the earl leaves town to see to business on his country estate he is disappointed by horatia's decision to remain in london. horatia fills her days with entertainments to drown out her feelings of loneliness with her husband away in the country. she attends a ball and upon getting in her carriage to go home, is kidnapped and taken to lord lethbridge's house where he intends to ruin her to gain his revenge on rule. horatia manages to knock him out and escape but in the process loses a very distinctive brooch from the earl's heirloom set of jewels. horatia calls upon her brother pelham and his friend, mr pommeroy, to restore the brooch to her before rule returns from his estate. they are unsuccessful because rule's jealous cousin, mr drelincourt, has found the brooch at lethbridge's house and has immediately set forth for rule's country estate to share this news. lethbridge overtakes drelincourt on the road and wrests the brooch from him. drelincourt continues on his journey anyway and rule is furious at his cousin's insinuation that horatia and lethbridge are having an affair. rule sets off back to london, meets lethbridge on the way and the two men have a swordfight, which rule wins. meanwhile, pelham and his posse plan to hold up lethbridge's carriage and steal back the brooch. however, they get the carriages confused and accidentally hold up rule's carriage instead (lethbridge still being in the country, recovering from his wounds). horatia, learning that pelham has not recovered her brooch is miserable and anxious because she wants to act on her feelings for her husband, but can't while she still believes lethbridge has the brooch in his possession. she receives an anonymous note saying that her brooch will be restored to her if she attends vauxhall pavilion at midnight. horatia, thinking lethbridge sent the note, makes the meeting with pelham and mr pommeroy hidden nearby in the bushes. she is surprised when the earl arrives and returns her brooch to her. he confesses his feelings for her and she affirms that they are reciprocated. ||| 6 ||| 2
william mandella is a physics student conscripted for an elite task force in the united nations exploratory force being assembled for a war against the taurans, an alien species discovered when they apparently suddenly attacked human colonists' ships. the unef ground troops are sent out for reconnaissance and revenge. the elite recruits have iqs of 150 and above, are highly educated, healthy and fit. training is gruellingfirst on earth, in missouri, and later on charon (not pluto's moon, which had not yet been discovered at the time of the novel's writing, but a hypothetical planet beyond pluto's orbit), which results in a number of casualtiesmainly due to accidents in hostile environments but also due to the use of live weapons in training. the new soldiers then depart for action, traveling via wormhole-like phenomena called 'collapsars' (called black holes today) that allow ships to cover thousands of light-years in a split second. however, traveling to and from the collapsars at near-lightspeed has massive relativistic effects. their first encounter with (unarmed) taurans on a planet orbiting epsilon aurigae turns into a massacre, with the unresisting enemy base wiped out. mandella melancholically reflects on how typical the encounter was for humanity's previous record in interaction with other cultures. this first expedition, beginning in 1997, lasted only two years from the soldier's perspective, but due to time dilation, upon return to earth decades have passed. on the long way home, the soldiers experience future shock first-hand, as the taurans employ increasingly advanced weaponry against them while they do not have the chance to re-arm. mandella, with soldier, lover and companion marygay potter, returns to civilian life, only to find humanity drastically changed. he and his fellow soldiers have difficulty fitting into a future society that has evolved almost beyond their comprehension. the veterans learn that to curb overpopulation, which led to worldwide class wars caused by inequitable rationing, homosexuality has become officially encouraged by many of the world's nations. the world has become a very dangerous place due to widespread unemployment and the easy availability of deadly weapons. the changes within society alienate mandella and the other veterans to the point where many re-enlist to escape, even though they realize the military is a soulless construct. mandella attempts to get an assignment as an instructor on luna but is promptly reassigned by standing order to combat command. the inability of the military to treat its soldiers as more than highly complex valuable machines is a theme of the story. almost entirely through luck, mandella survives four subjectively experienced years of military service, which time dilation makes equivalent to several centuries. he soon becomes the objectively oldest surviving soldier in the war, attaining high rank through seniority, not ambition (he is essentially a pacifist and an eternally reluctant soldier, who acts mostly from talent and a melancholic sense of duty). despite this he is separated from marygay (who has remained his last contact with the earth of his youth) by unef's plans, despite the fact that many of the people who he would command had not yet been born. as the commanding officer of a 'strike force', mandella commands soldiers who speak a language largely unrecognizable to him, whose ethnicity is now nearly uniform and are exclusively homosexual. he is disliked by the soldiers because they have to learn 21st century english to communicate with him and other senior staff, and because he is heterosexual. engaging in combat thousands of light years away from earth, mandella and his soldiers need to resort to medieval weapons in order to fight inside a "stasis field" which neutralizes all electromagnetic radiation in anything not covered with a protective coating. they battle to survive what is to be the last conflict of the war. during the time that has since passed on earth, humankind has begun to employ human cloning, resulting in a new, collective species calling itself man. man has developed a means of communication unique and inherent to clones, which allows them to communicate with the taurans, leading to peace. when man finally gains the ability to communicate with the taurans, it is discovered that the taurans were not responsible for the millennium-old destruction of the colonial vessels in question. the futile, meaningless war that lasted for more than a thousand years ends. man establishes several colonies of old-style, heterosexual humans, just in case the evolutionary change proves to be a mistake. mandella travels to one of these colonies, named 'middle finger' in the

the book begins with saturday discussing with her new dusk (who was younger brother to saturday's former dusk) her plan to invade sunday's realm, the incomparable gardens, which she has been trying to reach since the architect disappeared. arthur, returning to earth with friday's captives, discovers that the national army (under orders from general pravuil, who is secretly saturday's servant) is planning to destroy his hometown with nuclear bombs to prevent a disease outbreak, and uses the fifth key to stop time so that he can find a way to forestall this disaster. he then discovers that he is now more than 60% contaminated by sorcery, and is therefore irrevocably turning into an immortal denizen of the house. seeing no other choice, he returns to the lower house (leaving his friend leaf to deal with lady fridays' sleepers) to find it empty and on the verge of being annihilated by nothing. he barely escapes, but reaches the deep coal cellar, which is partially protected by the sorceries surrounding the old one's prison. after finding his advisor dr. scamandros in the cellar, arthur confronts the old one, who has grown in power and has destroyed his clockwork jailers. he is now surrounded by flowers, which he calls a sign of impending change. after talking to the old one (receiving no definite answers to his questions), arthur returns to the citadel in the great maze and plans a pre-emptive strike against saturday. arthur hence learns that saturday (as dame primus suspected in lady friday) has deliberately destroyed the lower house and far reaches to stunt the growth of the drasil trees that lift sunday's realm higher than saturday can build. she believes that even if the rest of the house is destroyed, the incomparable gardens will remain. dame primus wishes for arthur to fortify the rest of the house against the influx of nothing, but is reluctantly convinced to split herself into two (dame quarto and dame septum) to administer the house while arthur seizes the last keys from saturday and sunday. before she splits, dame primus tells arthur that the nothing which had destroyed the far reaches and lower house cannot be held off for ever unless the seventh key is recovered. arthur requests dame primus to give him the compleat atlas of the house, but dame primus evasively tells him that she does not have it. he suspects she is lying, but has no idea of her motive. arthur, accompanied by suzy turquoise blue, who has appointed herself general of a small regiment consisting solely of piper's children, infiltrates the upper house using the simultaneous bottles (see quantum entanglement) owned by the raised rats. there, they find that saturday is preparing her assault on the incomparable gardens, which are now within reach of her tower. finding that the sixth part of the will is dispersed in the rain that constantly falls in the upper house, arthur goes to a holding tank for the water to reconstitute the will (whereupon it assumes the shape of a raven), but is separated from suzy when they are attacked by artful loungers. flushed down to the lowest levels of the upper house, he encounters a force of new nithlings, led by the piper, preparing to attack the upper house. throughout all this, arthur finds that this part of the will is more agreeable to him than the first four, though not more so than the fifth, and more humble than any of them. his own metamorphosis is a subject of much attention in preceding chapters, wherein he discusses the changes with himself and suzy and struggles to control a ferocious arrogance and accompanying impatience that seem to have become part of his personality as a result of his transformation. it is suggested several times that he is not a typical denizen, on the basis that his blood is golden rather than blue and his eyes, unlike any denizen's, are luminous. with the will's help, arthur disguises himself as a sorcerous supernumerary (the lowest-ranked and most terminally depressed sorcerer) in hopes of rescuing suzy, but is caught up in saturday's assault force. in the incomparable gardens, arthur tries to take advantage of saturday's distraction by sunday's insectile guards to call the sixth key to him, but is thrown off the edge of the gardens by superior saturday's spell as he completes the necessary incantation. the outcome is unrevealed. the epilogue shows leaf trying to get as many people into the hospital's bomb shelter as she can before the bombs are launched. with the help of staff-member martine, she brings at least fifty-three into safety; but the others are killed as the bombs arrive. as the book concludes, she calls for arthur to return and set things right. ||| 0 ||| 2
the novel is set in the near future (2034–2080), after the solar system has been surrounded by an impenetrable shield (constructed by either aliens or extra-solar humans) known as the bubble. the bubble permits no light to enter the solar system, and as a consequence the stars can no longer be seen. this seems to be mere background at first, but in fact it is central to the plot. in the novel a physical process in the human brain is responsible for collapsing quantum wavefunctions representing systems into particular eigenstates. human observations of the universe were reducing its diversity and potentiality (for instance, by rendering it uninhabitable to beings that relied on stars being something other than the enormous nuclear fusion-powered furnaces human astronomers have observed them to be). hence it is suggested that the bubble was constructed to prevent humanity from wreaking massive destruction on the rest of the universe through the process of mere observation. in the course of the novel, the situation is further complicated when human researchers discover a way of modifying the brain to provide conscious control over the process, allowing people to suspend wavefunction collapse at will, and to choose which state the wavefunction will collapse to. this allows a person to choose how any nondeterministic event (such as flipping a coin) will turn out, provided that he is not being observed by anyone who is still involuntarily collapsing wavefunctions. this is used to perform a variety of low-probability tricks, such as tunneling through locked doors or getting past guards who happen to all be looking the other way as the person passes. the novel contains ideas not related to quantum mechanics. of particular note is the fact that people habitually download software to run in their brains. such "neural mods" (whose titles are always given in boldface, such as sentinel or p3) are installed by insufflating several drops of fluid carrying genetically modified microorganisms, which in turn carry nanomachines capable of rewiring nerve cells. the story's narrator accepts a case to investigate the disappearance of a woman from a psychiatric institute, which leads him to the ensemble. this is an organization that is developing a wavefunction collapse inhibitor neural mod, the "eigenstate mod". this mod allows the user to stop being an observer in the sense of quantum mechanics and consequently to "smear", i.e. to exist in a superposition of different states at the same time and to pick eigenstates of personal preference from the range of possible states, when the personal wavefunction is collapsed. he is put under the control of the ensemble by the forced installation of a "loyalty mod" in his brain which makes loyal support for the organization his highest goal. the narrator meets a group of other ensemble loyalists (the canon) who have discovered that their keepers have failed to specify exactly what they are to be loyal to (except by its name) and consequently, being its most loyal members, start to define what the ensemble is themselves. the narrator, working with the canon, then proceeds to steal the eigenstate mod. a rogue member of the canon infects all of humanity with the software. (normally, neither the microorganisms nor the nanomachines involved in installing neural mods can survive long outside the human body, but in this case the rogue scientist uses the eigenstate-control mod to modify their properties.) as a result, causality is weakened all over the globe, and the untrained humans, not knowing what to do with their newfound freedom, break down the fabric of reality as the stars suddenly reappear in the sky then turn into an almost blinding flash as the heavens fill with lights and possibilities undreamed of... then things suddenly are back to normal (less the loyalty mod) and two main characters debrief each other on a park bench, trying to understand how the "smeared" humanity was able to control events before people were all infected with the eigen-mod and why the "smeared" humanity chose to return the world to normal (one theory put forward is that they reached the edge of the bubble, had a nice chat with the aliens and decided to go home and enjoy life as it was). ||| 2 ||| 5

the story takes place in ossining, new york. ed japhet is sixteen years old, and he is a bright, articulate boy. his father terence teaches at his school. ed's hobby is performing magic tricks, hence he is the "magician" of the title. one evening, ed performs in front of the school on prom night, and aggravates school hoodlum urek. urek and his gang wait for ed that night as he is about to go home with his dad and girlfriend. urek attacks ed and nearly kills him. urek is eventually arrested on a charge of serious assault. at first this looks like a straightforward case. but urek's dad happens to have a lawyer named thomassy, who has made it his life's work to defend the low-lifes and the criminals of the area - and to get them off the hook. when thomassy started his promising career as a lawyer he joined a firm with wasp surnames deliberately. they took him on and he became their most brilliant lawyer. however, the senior partner told him that as an armenian he would never get promoted, at least while he was alive. thomassy, stung, left and decided to follow a controversial path defending the most undesirable characters in society. he sends a birthday card every year to the old senior partner, as if to say, "you still alive?" as the story unfolds, the reader becomes uncomfortably aware of how an event can be interpreted by the law. it seems as though ed has the advantage, he is talented, with a nice family and girlfriend, horribly attacked and nearly killed by a brute. but thomassy manages to play the attack down: he discredits witnesses, intimidates others, and portrays urek as acting only in self defense. now the reader is unsure who the actual "magician" of the title really is. also involved is german jewish psychiatrist koch, who has taken an interest in the case. his involvement gives the reader an opportunity to see urek in more depth, as previously he is portrayed as a mindless, violent and inarticulate monster. nothing can excuse what he has done, but koch offers more insight as to why he did it. the book ends on a violent note. urek walks free from the assault charge and proceeds to attack ed again, this time by hiding in terence's car and leaping out at ed. ed, newly trained in karate, can now defend himself against the thuggish urek, with devastating results. terence japhet knows exactly whom to call. the book is written in the third person narrative style, but interspersed at intervals throughout the story are "comments" provided by the key characters. they are written in the style of statements, but the reader never knows to whom they are directed. ||| 7 ||| 5

tender branson sits in the cockpit of a boeing 747-400, telling his life story to the black box. he is alone in the plane, having hijacked it; he has released all of the plane's passengers and crew prior to this point. he explains the events leading up to the hijacking. tender is a member of the fanatical creedish cult, which engaged in a mass suicide ten years previously. he is one of the creedish members who was sent out into the world to work as a servant, and send his income back to the creedish community. creedish members have been steadily killing themselves since the mass suicide, in keeping with their belief that the deliverance is at hand. at the start of his story, tender works as the housekeeper for a rich couple he never sees in oregon. they issue directions via a daily planner and a speaker phone. in addition to cleaning, tender gives the couple etiquette lessons over the phone and tends their garden (which he does by planting fake flowers, which he says is easier than planting real flowers and taking care of them). at his dingy apartment, he gets phone calls from people who want to kill themselves - the result of a newspaper misprint which printed his phone number as the number for a suicide prevention hotline. tender, enjoying the thrill of passing divine judgment on these people tells them to kill themselves as often as not, and sees this as an act of mercy. although the newspaper prints a retraction, the calls keep coming, and when they dwindle, tender prints up fliers for a fake crisis hotline with his number on them so the calls will continue. one of the calls comes from a trevor hollis, a man who wants to kill himself because of the nightmares he has been having about disasters, like plane crashes or fires. tender tells trevor to kill himself, and soon after, reads his obituary in the paper. one day, tender goes to the mausoleum to steal fake flowers for his employer's garden (a common pastime), and decides to visit trevor's tomb while he is there. at the tomb, he meets trevor's sister, fertility, and they talk. later that night, tender has his weekly meeting with his caseworker from the federal survivor retention program, a government agency that keeps tabs on the survivors of suicide cults. as usual, he asks how many survivors of the creedish faith there are remaining, and she tells him, "one hundred and fifty-seven survivors. nationwide." tender begins to explain how the creedish church works. only the firstborn sons and their wives get to stay and reside in the community (located in rural nebraska) - the rest, like tender, are sent out to work as humble servants, and are considered to be the church's missionaries. they are extensively trained in etiquette, housecleaning, and other menial labor, after which they are baptized and sent out into the world to make a living. every month, they are expected to send back money and a letter of confession. "tender" is not really a name, but a title, which is given to all male children except the firstborn, who is called "adam". likewise, all female children are called "biddy", including the eldest. "tender" is meant to denote one who tends; "biddy", one who is biddable. all but the firstborn sons and their wives are discouraged from having sex of any kind and are forbidden to marry, and the latter are expected to have sex only for procreation. all the creedish wear highly recognizable clothing, both inside the community and out. this makes it easy to spot another member of the church in the outside world. tender further describes how, ten years previously, someone leaked the church's doings (i.e. cult brainwashing, tax evasion, unregistered births) to the police of bolster county, nebraska, and the fbi are put on the case. the fbi move in to arrest the cult leaders only to find the entire community dead in an act of mass suicide upon hearing the news. the remaining survivors are expected to be prepared for such an event (called the "deliverance" by the church), and kill themselves as soon as they hear the news. after their meeting, fertility calls tender thinking she has called the crisis hotline. tender soon realizes it's fertility, so he begins to talk to her in a fake voice. because it is revealed later that fertility is psychic and knows "everything", it is understood that she knows at this point that she is speaking to tender. she talks about her brother's suicide and how she met tender ("a pretty weird guy") at the mausoleum, mentioning how he reminded her of a creedish cult member, and adding that he was extremely unattractive and she believed him to be trevor's ex-homosexual lover. eventually, she asks the man at the "crisis hotline" (i.e. tender) to have phone sex with her, but he hangs up after turning her down. he then stops answering his phone in fear that fertility will be on the other line, wanting to have phone sex or growing more attracted to him as a mysterious voice than as a person. during another meeting with his caseworker (which regularly takes place at his employers' house), tender gets frustrated and tells her that if she wants to help him, she can start by scrubbing the shower tiles. burnt out over a decade of lost suicide cases, the caseworker quickly grows obsessed with cleaning and soon takes over tender's job, drifting more and more away from helping him confront his past. she reveals at this time that many of the creedish suicides were really murders masked to look like suicides to encourage more survivors to kill themselves. a week from their last meeting, tender and fertility meet again at trevor's tomb in the mausoleum. fertility teaches him to dance, while revealing that trevor had been psychic, and all the things he had dreamt about had really happened. at home, tender receives a suspicious call from a man he recognizes as a member of the creedish church, and he soon realizes that the murderer of creedish survivors is actually creedish himself. the call scares him, for he fears that he will be the next victim. abruptly after the call, fertility also calls tender, again trying to reach the crisis hotline, and she tells him about dancing with the man at the mausoleum and asks him to get together with her. tender (as the man at the crisis hotline) agrees, on the condition that she agrees to take the man from the mausoleum (i.e. him) out on a date. she agrees. on their date, tender and fertility ride the bus downtown, where a stranger rudely begins telling them facile jokes pointed at the creedish mass suicide. tender laughs at all the jokes, secretly wondering if the joker can tell he's creedish. fertility snaps at the joker for making fun of suicide. when the joker rises to exit the bus, tender recognizes the man's pants as creedish dress, and suddenly recognizes the man as adam, his twin brother. tender speaks adam's name aloud, but when adam asks if they are brothers, he desperately denies it. after the bus incident, fertility takes tender to a department store that she presciently knows will catch on fire, but that she knows will not harm them. fertility explains that she has the same talent as her brother for dreaming the future. tender soon learns that he has become one of the last two survivors of the creedish church. the caseworker has him go over photos of dead creedish to see if he can identify the other survivor, but he already knows it to be his brother adam. he begins receiving phone calls from journalists and agents wanting his story. the caseworker manages to suffocate on a chemical solution of ammonia and chlorine that she was using to clean the fireplace, which had been secretly mixed together by adam, and whose intended target was tender. adam steals the caseworker's files on the creedish suicides immediately after the murder. the police suspect tender, but he claims innocence and slips away. tender, meanwhile, calls an agent and takes a flight to new york that very night. thus begins his road to stardom. the agent's company has been planning for years to turn the last survivor of the creedish cult into a religious celebrity. they create a fake history for tender and completely overhaul his body. he is given steroid injections, health food, teeth caps, and is made to exercise and diet incessantly until he is the model of attractiveness. it is made clear by the agent that no one will worship an ugly religious leader. tender is entirely agreeable to all of it, as he has no will to live and desires fame only in order to have an enormous audience for when he commits suicide. as his agent's plans are realized, tender's fame grows. these plans include the publication of tender's "autobiography" and the "book of very common prayer", as well as the conversion of the former creedish land into the tender branson sensitive materials sanitary landfill (a repository for america's outdated porn). tender is constantly waiting for the opportune moment to kill himself, and continually puts it off as circumstances fail to meet his criteria. then, as his popularity starts to wane, the agent tells him that he needs to perform a miracle in order to stay famous. it is then that fertility finds tender and gives him a prediction to make on tv that will seem like a miracle when it comes true. naturally, it does, and tender's fame swells to even greater proportions. it is unclear at this point why fertility has shown up and decided to help. this pattern goes on for some time, until the super bowl comes up and tender's agent plans him an elaborate wedding to take place at half-time, following which, tender will issue another miraculous prediction. tender goes wandering around, trying to meet up with fertility, which he finally does in a men's bathroom where they've taken adjacent stalls. adam appears then with a gun, and reveals that he's already laid a trap to kill tender's agent the same way he killed the caseworker, so that tender would be suspect for both murders. fertility confirms that the agent will die the next day at the super bowl, and comes up with a plan for tender to make a prediction big enough to distract the police long enough for him to escape. adam, intending this all along, plans to escape with tender and fertility. agreed on their course of action, the three part. the day of the super bowl, the agent dies, tender is married, and as the police come to arrest him, tender predicts that the colts will beat the cardinals 27-24. the stadium erupts in a chaos as angry football fans pour out of their seats to chase tender and it is all the police can do to stop the crowd from mobbing him to death. tender escapes with adam and fertility to a ronald mcdonald house. the three then begin their journey across the country by hitching rides in semi-trucks transporting incomplete sections of houses from one location to another. during their journey, fertility intentionally gets separated from the brothers. adam and tender, then, steal a car that fertility foretold would be unlocked in a particular parking lot. attached to the dashboard is a little commercial figurine of tender. the brothers, heading north to canada, come to the tender branson sensitive materials sanitary landfill on the way. as they drive through it, adam begins recounting the way the church leaders terrorized the children into fearing sex by forcing them to watch every time a woman went into labor. tender denies this, but it is unclear whether he simply doesn't want to remember, or whether he actually can't remember because the trauma is buried so deep in his memory. adam believes the only way to cure tender is for tender to have sex - to reject the church doctrine at its core. tender resists, and as adam recounts the details of the "mental castration" (as he calls it), tender loses control and crashes the car into a giant concrete pylon in the middle of the landfill. the crash causes the airbags to deploy, and the one on the passenger's side sends the tender figurine into adam's left eye. adam pulls out the figurine and asks tender to find a rock and hit him with it. tender refuses, but adam asks him to find any rock that he can just to disfigure him with, pleading that if he goes to jail for his murders, he doesn't want the other inmates to even think about sexually abusing him. tender reluctantly agrees to do this, as long as adam will tell him when to stop, but adam keeps telling him to swing again until it is too late and adam dies. immediately afterwards, fertility shows up in a taxicab and takes tender away from the landfill. they go back to oregon, and fertility plans to go on a quick job assignment to make some money. fertility's job is being a surrogate mother for couples who can't conceive (fertility is actually a pseudonym - her real name is gwen); however, fertility actually happens to be barren, so her job is, in essence, prostitution. the job she takes coincidentally happens to be for tender's former employers. in the middle of the night, tender sneaks into the house, and fertility has sex with him in the guest bedroom (for a short while, for according to tender, he only got in a few inches.) the next morning, tender wakes up; and fertility tells him that she's pregnant. she then leaves for the airport to board a plane to sydney, australia. in her planner that she leaves behind, tender reads that someone is going to hijack the plane and crash it into the australian outback. following fertility to the airport, tender finds her, takes adam's gun (which she has stashed in an urn purportedly containing her brother's cremated remains), and uses it to board the plane. he then begins searching for the "real" hijacker until the joke dawns on him and he realizes that he is the hijacker. the plot thus returns to the beginning, with tender telling his life story. he mentions that fertility told him there was a way for him to escape the plane before it crashes, but on the record, he can't seem to figure it out. the book ends mid-sentence, but without any definitive answer as to whether tender lives or dies. however, it has been stated by the author that tender survives, and an explanation is available on chuck palahniuk's official website http://www.chuckpalahniuk.net/books/survivor/ending-survivor. ||| 6 ||| 7
humanity has spread across the galaxy, and the outer colony "harvest" is one of the most remote. although harvest itself is only one-third the size of earth, its fertile surface serves as the breadbasket for the other colonies. the united nations space command office of naval intelligence (oni) notices strange disappearances of human ships around harvest, and assumes that insurrectionists are attacking the vessels. the oni pulls staff sergeants avery johnson and nolan byrne from the frontlines of the civil war to raise a militia to protect harvest. meanwhile, it is revealed that the disappearances are due to an alien kig-yar vessel intercepting the ships in their search for relics left by the forerunners, an ancient race sacred to the kig-yar and other members of the covenant. members of the vessel are shocked to discover that their instruments indicates hundreds of thousands of forerunner relics on the planet of harvest. a covenant unggoy deacon named dadab is alarmed when he realizes the kig-yar shipmistress intends to steal a portion of the relics for herself, starting with relics leaving the planet on a human cargo ship. the ship is actually a trap set by the humans, with johnson and byrne onboard. johnson and byrne kill several of the covenant boarding party when they enter the cargo ship, which is later destroyed by a methane explosion. dadab and his huragok friend, lighter than some, escape the blast and are picked up by a covenant ship crewed by jiralhanae. these agents, led by their chieftain maccabeus, have been ordered to confirm the presence of the relics; despite the reservations of his nephew, tartarus, maccabeus agrees to parley with the humans on harvest. in the midst of the meeting in harvest's gardens, the covenant begin a firefight and the peace talks are shattered. on the covenant holy city of high charity, two san 'shyuum, the minister of fortitude and the vice-minister of tranquility, plot to take the place of the three prophet hierarchs currently leading the covenant. they visit the old, supposedly senile philologist for blessings and advice, seeking a third san 'shyuum to help them usurp the throne. as tranquility and fortitude are meeting with the philologist, the "oracle", a forerunner a.i. named mendicant bias, suddenly awakens from eons of dormancy. mendicant bias informs the san 'shyuum that the "forerunner artifacts" found at harvest are actually the a.i.'s "makers", living forerunners—meaning that the humans themselves are the descendants of the covenant's gods, and that all the covenant's writings are false. the minister of fortitude realizes that the truth must never be revealed, as this revelation would tear the covenant apart. instead, fortitude, tranquility, and the philologist plot to quickly take the throne so they can exterminate the "reclaimers". back on harvest, johnson and his squad of militia are heavily out-manned and out-gunned. maccabeus is ordered to "glass" the planet from space, but disobeys and launches a ground assault in an effort to recover the "relics". the human militia tries to keep the aliens busy while evacuating the civilians from the planet; this requires johnson and his team to board an orbital platform controlled by dadab and his troops. tartarus challenges maccabeus for control of the jiralhanae pack, killing his uncle and becoming the next leader. lighter than some is killed by tartarus' troops, and dadab goes off to kill those he believes are responsible. as his weapon only has one more shot left, dadab searches for tartarus, who is fighting johnson. dadab destroys tartarus' shield, and the enraged brute kills the deacon. wallace jenkins, a young militia member that had lost his family in the battle, attempts to finish tartarus off, but the alien escapes. the human civilians and survivors of harvest successfully evacuate the planet on hundreds of freighters, while on high charity, the minister of fortitude, tranquility, and the philologist become the new prophet hierarchs. they take the names truth, regret, and mercy, declaring a new age for the covenant has begun, and that the humans must be annihilated for their crimes. ||| 5 ||| 5

the narrative focuses on the stories of several harvard professors as they deliberate whether tenure should be imparted on assistant professor dennis gossen. gossen is an up-and-coming economics figure, who is hopeful that the promotion and tenure committee will find him of adequate qualification to receive tenure at harvard university—a very prestigious accomplishment. the p and t committee is headed by celebrated anthropologist and harvard dean denton clegg and consists of distinguished sociologist oliver wu, chemist sophia ustinov, english professor calvin weber, psychology professor valerie danzig, mathematics professor morrison bell, classicist foster barrett and dominant economics professor henry spearman. dennis somehow shows up at the door of henry spearman, who is not home, and let in by henry’s wife, pidge. because dennis appears so distraught, pidge calls her husband and tells him to come home early, which he does. however, spearman refuses to discuss anything with dennis on the basis that he is not allowed to converse with tenure candidates. p and t committee meetings proceed to take place, and dennis gossen is turned down for tenure with a 3-3 vote. oliver wu, sophia ustinov and calvin weber all vote in favor of promotion, while valerie danzig, morrison bell and foster barrett all vote that dennis gossen is not cut out for harvard. dean clegg is naturally placed in the role of tie breaker, and votes against advancement, as is his policy with ties. because of his failure, dennis gossen seemingly commits suicide. within the next week, morrison bell and foster barrett, two of the people who voted against gossen’s promotion were murdered, and dennis’s fiancé, melissa shannon, is arrested for the crime. the prosecution charged that she murdered them because she felt that they were responsible for her fiancé’s suicide, and the melissa’s defense argued that the evidence was merely circumstantial; shannon is eventually convicted by the jury and sentenced to a life in prison. economist henry spearman is skeptical, however. applying economic analysis, he could not fathom how the benefits of suicide could have outweighed the emotional cost that gossen—a very rational person—was paying for his failure. he also did not think it rational that melissa shannon was so upset that she would kill two harvard professors. with melissa shannon in jail, the harvard alumni are all aboard a cruise to europe. this is where spearman finally uses economic reasoning to deduce who really murdered dennis, morrison, and foster: dean clegg. his theory is proven when clegg, knowing that spearman is on to him, leaves behind a note explaining everything; clegg coveted academic distinction, and went to an island to write a book he hoped would be revolutionary in his field of anthropology. however, he had been absent from his field as dean for a couple of years and was having trouble. that was when he conceived the idea to forge data for his book. it turned out that dennis gossen read his book and found economic inconsistencies in the data clegg had made up and realized that clegg was a fraud. gossen blackmailed clegg to vote in favor of his promotion, which clegg happily agreed to. however, clegg wanted to secure his secret, and so he killed gossen and made it look like suicide. he then killed two of his colleagues who he thought might find out his dirty secret and framed melissa shannon. ||| 3 ||| 6

the story takes place in london, where dr. sabian blake is sitting in his attic at the top of his house in bloomsbury square, looking out to space through his telescope, in search of a special star. he is told about this star by the nemorensis, an ancient book that holds many old and powerful secrets. it has predicted that the comet wormwood, which was foretold in the book of revelation, is hurtling towards the earth, and would spell certain doom for london and all other lands around her. as blake is observing this, a series of cataclysmic and destructive events, referred to as a 'sky-quake', hits the city, the aftermath of which involves horses and dogs going completely mad and attacking everyone in sight. the reason for these happenings was that the power of the keruvim was being used in the north by the evil pyratheon, in his vain attempt to overthrow riathamus. we are then introduced to agetta lamian, blake's servant-girl, whose father cadmus lamian owns a lodging house on fleet street. eventually it transpires that pyratheon's evil sister, yerzinia, is using the nemorensis to call down the comet and reshape the devastated london in her own, dark image. ||| 2 ||| 2

in a black and white world there is only fiction or nonfiction yet in reality there is too much truth to this story to call it pure fiction so i prefer to call it gray fiction like a good conversation among friends this book is not afraid to tackle those grayer areas where black and white are less defined in this case where truth and fiction often intersect and blur together in this book all of the thoughts feelings frustrations desires and experiences of the developing serial killer are authentic and real the person who provided the insight for this story has been plagued by such ungodly thoughts and desires his whole life fortunately he has never chosen to act on the violent fantasies and temptations that plague his mind and heart yet that should not make any of his thoughts and fantasies less genuine or valid it is also a fictional tale about the life and confessions of a serial killer many of the events and personal experiences that are incorporated into this story come from real life experiences of known serial killers this was done in hopes of making this book the most accurate portrayal of human emotion possible half this book is true and half this book is purely fiction so let the reader use their own discernment to distinguish where the truth ends and the fiction begins ||| 1 ||| 4

in the introduction, it summarizes how the clans (including skyclan) was formed. it then cuts to leafpool introducing the warrior code to us (as we are rogues visiting leafpool to learn more of the code.) each code starts with leafpool giving a hint about the story and how the code was formed. sometimes there is an extra story after it. code one tells the story of cloudberry of riverclan and ryewhisker of windclan. cloudberry is expecting ryewhisker's kits and ryewhisker believes the kits will end the territorial dispute between the two clans. but instead, in a battle, ryewhisker was killed when he was trying to defend cloudberry from his clanmates. this led the clans to form the first code and start a gathering place. code two begins at the gathering when brindlestar, leader of shadowclan, complains to thunderclan. thunderclan accuses shadowclan of stealing prey and a fight starts to break out. the fight was interrupted when a branch falls between the two clans and no cats were hurt. it was a sign from starclan that no clan cat may cross the border and forms the next code. (in a mini-story, one-eye, known as white-eye and dappletail wish to catch a fish to know why riverclan like the prey so much.) code three tells the story of splashheart of riverclan and another battle with thunderclan over the sunningrocks. splashheart is guided by a starclan cat and riverclan wins over the sunningrocks and celebrate by feeding the elders and kits, and hints that splashheart will become leader of riverclan one day. (in a mini-story, longtail and darkstripe are going out hunting for the elders, but darkstripe eats the fresh-kill intended for poppydawn and longtail could do nothing. since they could not make it on time, poppydawn dies from greencough and longtail regrets deeply.) code four starts at shadowclan territory when driftkit and fallowkit play with fresh-kill and were scolded by their leader, deputy and mother. an owl soon swoops in the camp and takes the fresh-kill away and lilystar says its a sign from starclan. code five begins with a worried windclan queen named daisytail, who worries that her son is too young to be in a battle against shadowclan. she and a queen from shadowclan stop the battle and tell their leaders that their apprentices should still be kits until they are at least six moons old. (in a mini-story, during the reign of brokenstar and battle to drive out windclan, flintfang watches as his apprentice [who is three moons old] dies.) code six starts with the riverclan's medicine cat, meadowpelt, as he overhears some of the new warriors are going to jump the gorge on the full-moon. meadowpelt goes to starclan for answers and finds out the warriors must stand vigil during the next to think about being a warrior and the warriors save the nursery from a fox and learn the true importance of being a warrior. (squirrelflight tells us what do at a vigil in a mini-story.) code seven tells the tale of acorntail, as he is chosen deputy for windclan. but he keeps messing up and tells featherstar that she must choose a different deputy. featherstar notices that acorntail didn't learn how to lead and gain loyalty which is taught through an apprentice and acorntail decides he must have an apprentice. code eight starts when beechstar, leader of skyclan, gives his leadership to his son mothpelt. mothpelt wishes to avenge his father's death and leads an attack to riverclan. the river was over flown and robinwing and maplewhisker, the deputy, has to save the warriors from drowning. mothpelt gives up his position to maplewhisker and forms a new code. (in a mini-story, tallstar talks to bluestar about his last choice in making onewhisker as deputy.) code nine begins when the shadowclan deputy dies from greencough soon after their leader died. in order to decide a new leader, jumpfoot and mossfire fight to the death for the position. redscar, the clan's medicine cat, turns to starclan for the answer. they tell him they must chose a new leader and the leader must chose a new deputy immediately. redscar chooses flowerstem because she watched her sister, mossfire, die right in front of her and flowerstem's only thoughts were to help the clan. code ten starts at a gathering and all four clans were attacked by shadowclan, led by ripplestar. as ripplestar attacks finchstar, leader of thunderclan, starclan sends clouds over the moon and kills ripplestar with a bolt of lightning - giving a sign to all clans. code eleven begins when a skyclan warrior named poppycloud and her apprentice accidentally overstep the thunderclan border and were caught. the leader of thunderclan goes to the skyclan leader and tells him what is going on. poppycloud explains that they could not smell the border because it was not freshly made, which brings up the decision to remark their borders daily. (in a mini-story, whitestorm teaches firepaw, graypaw, ravenpaw, sandpaw, and dustpaw about border tactics.) code twelve begins when the riverclan medicine cat, graywing, and a couple of warriors see windclan kits fall into the gorge. graywing says that it is only windclan's loss and there is nothing they can do. but the starclan kits come to graywing and tell her the importance of kits in a clan and graywing and the warriors get the kits' bodies out of the gorge. (in a mini-story, tigerkit (tigerstar as a kit) is saved by a couple of warriors from shadowclan from a fox.) code thirteen starts at the gathering, where darkstar, leader of skyclan, gives a huge piece of territory to thunderclan. raincloud out loud tells him that he is wrong to do that, and darkstar makes a new code so a leader won't be out staged by their warriors like that. (in a mini-story, cloudstar talks about a broken promise.) code fourteen starts with the shadowclan medicine cat, mossheart, seeing her clanmates die in a battle skirmish. she and the other clan medicine cats go to moonstone together and are both told that this unnecessary death must stop. it also initiates a place where all medicine cats are defined from clan skirmishes and a place where they all share tongues with starclan. code fifteen starts with lionpaw stalking pinestar to the twoleg border. pinestar tells lionpaw that what he saw is absolutely secret and must not tell other cats. soon lionpaw finds out that pinestar wishes to live with twolegs and lionpaw pushes him to tell the clan this. pinestar thanks him and tells him that his future name will be lionheart. (in a mini-story, sandstorm tells about her thoughts on fireheart.) in the end, leafpool tells what was not included in the warrior code and says goodbye. the cover shows (from left to right) blackstar, firestar, tallstar, and leopardstar. below them, they are surrounded by a group of cats, so the picture presumably depicts a gathering. ||| 2 ||| 2
the book begins with tally, the protagonist, as a pretty debating what to wear to a bash. while attending the bash at which she is to be voted into the "crims" clique, she is followed by someone who appears to be a "special", a member of special circumstances. tally can only remember her adventures as an ugly in brief, disconnected bits —because, there are lesions on all the pretties brains. she is surprised to discover that the person stalking her is croy, an old friend of hers from the smoke. he has something for her, he tells her, but she must search for it later. she agrees, bemused by his repellent ugliness, including his big pores and tangled hair – all the imperfections that the surgery to become a pretty transforms into beauty. tally returns to her care-free life as a pretty. her peace is disrupted when zane, who is the leader of the crims, asks her about david, whom she loved while she lived in the smoke. zane had once known croy and had been determined to escape to the smoke before his surgery. he regrets that he didn't go into the wilderness then. zane is eager to accompany tally in finding the object croy has hidden for her. they face strenuous, dangerous physical challenges in order to locate the item, which is accompanied by a letter from tally to herself, written before she went under the knife. the letter explained to her future self why she had become a pretty – to take a brain lesion pill. zane and tally learn that the pretties' brains are altered during their surgery. after taking the pills, their main goal is to be bubbly.

mitochondria are the "energy factories" of biological cells. it is thought that they were originally separate organisms, and a symbiotic relationship between them and early cellular life has evolved into their present position as cell organelles with no independent existence (see endosymbiotic theory). the novel's plot supposes that mitochondria, which are inherited through the female line of descent, form the dispersed body of an intelligent conscious life-form, dubbed eve, which has been waiting throughout history and evolution for the right conditions when mitochondrial life can achieve its true potential and take over from eukaryotic life-forms (i.e. humans and similar life) by causing a child to be born that can control its own genetic code. eve is able to control people's minds and bodies by signaling to the mitochondria in their bodies. she can cause certain thoughts to occur to them and also make them undergo spontaneous combustion. the conditions eve has waited for have arrived; she has found the perfect host in the body of kiyomi nagishima. at the start of the book, eve is the mitochondria in kiyomi's body. she causes kiyomi to crash her car; kiyomi survives but is brain dead. kiyomi's husband is toshiaki, a research assistant teaching and researching biological science. eve influences toshiaki and a doctor to ensure that one of kiyomi's kidneys is transplanted into the teenage girl mariko anzai as an organ donation. as part of kiyomi's body, the kidney is also a part of eve; this prepares mariko to be a suitable host for giving birth to mitochondrial life, as her immune system would otherwise rebel. eve influences toshiaki to grow some of kiyomi's liver cells in his lab in sufficient quantities to provide eve with an independent body, he thinks that he is doing this as an experiment using different cultures of the liver cells. forming some of the cells into a body, eve possesses toshiaki's assistant sachiko asakura and intermittently takes control of asakura to work upon the cultures. eventually, she takes control of asakura during a conference presentation speech and announces her presence. leaving asakura's body, she returns to the lab. toshiaki pursues her, and she rapes him in the form of kiyomi to capture some of his sperm, which she uses to fertilize an egg of her own production. moving to the hospital, she implants this egg in mariko's womb. the egg develops into a child that is born almost immediately. eve anticipates that her child will be able to consciously change its genetic code, thus being an infinitely adaptable "perfect life form" capable of replacing humanity and similar life-forms. mariko's body will be host to a new race of these life-forms. the experiment fails, since toshiaki's sperm carry a separate line of "male" mitochondria (inherited through sperm) that will be wiped out in the new order; these resist the change by fighting for control of the child's body, causing it to switch between male and female forms. the child dies; toshiaki also dies, merging his body with the child's to control the bursts of psychokinetic-like power it gives out in its death throes that threaten to kill many people. in the novel's epilogue, it is revealed that some samples of the eve cells in toshiaki's lab survived. fortunately, they are destroyed shortly after being found. ||| 5 ||| 5

the story is set in an alternate universe, taking place after the “voodoo wars”, a conflict between humans and the “others”. the others mainly consist of vampires, werewolves, and demons, though the main conflict occurs between humans and vampires. as a result of this war, “bad spots”, or places where black magic thrives, have appeared more frequently. rae "sunshine" seddon, the pastry-making heroine of the novel, has the misfortune of being caught off-guard at her family's old lake side cabin and is abducted by a gang of vampires. she is confined to the ballroom of an abandoned mansion with constantine, a vampire shackled there by vampires of a rival gang, led by constantine’s enemy bo. bo’s intention is to allow constantine to slowly die of hunger and exposure to sunlight. rae is brought as bait for him, and the vampires cut her upper chest as temptation. however, rae not only manages to defy the supposed power that any vampire has over a human, but also uses her all-but-forgotten magical powers of transmutation, taught to her by her grandmother, to effect an escape. rae realizes that the magical lineage she has ignored allows her to draw power from the sunlight, ergo transferring her ability through touch to constantine and allowing him to be under the light of day, so long as contact is maintained. through this symbiotic relationship, the two of them make an escape. despite her best efforts, all does not return to normalcy once rae is back home. her friends and family are shocked by her survival of an encounter with vampires, and over time she both starts to become more affected by the trauma and refuses to tell anyone the circumstances leading to her alliance with a vampire. as it becomes clear that the conflict with bo and his gang is only beginning, sunshine begins to embrace her magical ability, is coerced into working with the "special other forces", wonders what kind of tentative partnership can exist between two individuals whose races are bitter enemies, and, finally, works with constantine to overthrow bo for good. ||| 2 ||| 2
the children of wetchik are ready to board the starship basilica and embark on their journey from the planet harmony back to the origin of humanity: earth. however, the rivalry between nafai and elemak promises the journey will be anything but peaceful. each faction already has hidden plans to prematurely awaken from the long hibernation, to have the upper hand when the landing occurs. the children become pawns in their parents' power struggle - valuable potential adults that can strengthen each faction. but the oversoul is ultimately in control, having uploaded a copy of itself into basilica's central computer, so that it can monitor the ship at all times. after landing on earth, the fragile peace wrought onboard is merely a mask for the turmoils of passions that boil beneath. not only do the colonists have to deal with the split, there are also the mysteriously symbiotic alien races that have evolved on earth since humanity's departure. the quest to understand the angels (giant bats) and the diggers (giant rats) that were foreshadowed in the dreams is not an easy one. the focus throughout the course of this novel begins to drift away from the original generation of characters in order to delineate the passage of time. the factions that developed among the original generation have now spread to their children, through no fault of the children themselves. nafai finds himself and his "nafari" living and working primarily amongst the angel people, whereas the "elemaki" associate much more closely with the diggers. it is this dissociation that eventually breaks nearly all the bonds—literally, for hushidh and cheveya—between nafai and his older brother, elemak. as elemak's rage and hatred for nafai grow, he ingrains such feelings into his family and the digger people, laying the foundation for war. after the death of volemak the nafari migrate northwards away from the landing site to found a new nation. ||| 2 ||| 5

in the novel, much of which was originally published in serial form in astounding science fiction magazine, hidden throughout a future america of 1972 are a group of incredibly gifted children &mdash; all approximately the same age, all preternaturally intelligent, and all hiding their incredible abilities from a world they know will not understand them. these children were born to workers caught in an explosion at an atomic weapons facility, and orphaned just a few months after birth when their parents succumbed to delayed effects from the blast. like the characters in the better-known x-men series, these children are mutants, brought together to explore their unique abilities and study in secret at an exclusive school for gifted children, lest they be hated and feared by a world that would not understand them. the oakland tribune described it in 1953 as "the invevitable adjustments and maladjustments of minority genius to majority mediocrity". in shiras' book, none of the children are given paranormal super powers such as telekinesis or precognition—their primary difference is simply that of incredible intellect, combined with an energy and inquisitiveness that causes them to figuratively devour every book in their local libraries, to speed through university extension courses, and to publish countless articles and stories all over the world, but all done carefully through pen-names and mail-order, to disguise their youth, and protect them from the prejudicial stereotypes that less intelligent adults continue to try and enforce on children. ||| 5 ||| 4

clementine is unaware of the fact that jacky is a female and betrothed to jaimy. they almost catch up to jacky in pittsburgh with the help of mike fink, who wishes to kill jacky for stealing his boat, but jaimy and mike land in jail for a few weeks while clementine finds work aboard jacky's boat. clementine does not tell her about how jaimy and she traveled alone together for several hundred miles, and jaimy does not know that clementine is going away with jacky. they allow several people aboard as guests on the showboat. the first is yancy cantrell, a master at cards and widower, and his african-american daughter. cantrell and his daughter operate a scam by making selling the daughter to a slavemaster, whereafter chloeuses lockpicks to escape and meet back up with her father. new orleans is the destination of 'the belle of the golden west', jacky's showboat/casino. also aboard are crow jane and the hawkes boys, nathaniel and matthew 'matty'. crow jane is hired as the cook and the hawkes boys are boat crewmen clementine is crow jane's assistant and develops a relationship with jim tanner. while stopping at a town for two days on the way down the river, the whole crew goes off to spend their money. the day they leave, the hawkes brothers return with their new wives, honeysuckle rose and tupelo honey, whom jacky reluctantly let on board. the very reverend clawson comes aboard and does an act in jacky's show, which is a song-and-dance, a revival led by clawson, and a medicine show that advertises her elixir. he is also heading to new orleans. while on their cruise, one of the passengers forewarns them about a group of bloodthirsty bandits that resort at cave-in-rock on the outskirts of town. the last person aboard the ship is a runaway slave, solomon. the crew sail past the cave-in-rock, running into a "gentleman" sailor who knows the american rivers like the back of his hand. his name is frederick fortescue and he is actually a fraud. the trick is to lure the showboat into cave-in-rock so the bandits can kill the crew but jacky catches onto the scene, having fortescue imprisoned and later thrown overboard after they kill the bandits. another group of people taken aboard are the injuns, lightfoot and chee-a-quat. while they are on the way to new orleans, they help out the crew along the way and jacky gets to meet up with the two indians' tribes that live in a massive town of tepees. unbeknownst to jacky who goes to meet with the indians, they are secretly killing people in america for the british. jacky gets to meet tecumseh and takes up with some of the indians. but while venturing with tepeki, an indian girl, jacky faber runs into captain lord allen, a womanizing british captain of high rank. lightfoot has allen taken from jacky's presence and soon, jacky meets flashby and moseley who know instantly who she is. with the revelation of jacky's past to the indians, they soon turn against her and have the british take her away. flashby and moseley torture jacky during an interrogation aboard their ship but allen detests them intensely and has them go back to the indians. jacky charms allen with wine and the past, convinces allen to untie her and steals his gun. soon, higgins and the crew come to rescue jacky. jacky maintains the role as the captain of her 'belle of the golden west' and has moseley and flashby walk the plank. while she has allen journey with them to new orleans, jaimy soon catches up with them after escaping mike fink and their jail term. he meets up with jacky but catches her cheating so he intends to return back to britain. jacky finds out the puzzling connection between clementine and jacky; angering her deeply. when all is calm, jacky and the crew sail into baton rouge where captain allen and his crew decide to get off at instead of new orleans. jacky bids them a personal farewell and as they go looking for some supplies, jacky and the crew run into another enemy: slave hunters. the feared beam family of louisiana imprison jacky, solomon and chloe cantrell because they claim jacky is abolitionist and loves the black race. yancy tries to fight for her but ends up being wounded in the process. the beam family takes the three to their farm where they shackle solomon and chloe to their barn and plan to hang jacky. jacky rants on about being pregnant and at first, the family of strictly men (ma beam must have died before this story happened) plan on hanging but then say they plan on keeping jacky till she has her baby. pa beam, being a bible-thumping yet hypocritical man of god, goes to pray in the nearby woods. when he comes out, he claims the lord has told him to tar-and-feather jacky so they do just that. but soon they find out jacky is lying about being pregnant. lightfoot, chee-a-quat, the hawkes boys and katy deere come to save jacky. katy mortally wounds a son of pa beam - ezekiel, and lightfoot then bluntly kills him. the group are only able to kill three of the beam family before they can carry jacky, solomon and chloe to the safety of the 'belle of the golden west.'jacky is covered in tar so crow jane has to soak her in water, cut her hair very short and peel the tar off with knives and alcohol. things back at the ship have taken a turn for the worse, yancy cantrell's wound from being shot by one of the beams turns out to be a mortal wound and he soon dies from it. after lightfoot and chee-a-quat come back saying they've killed all of the beam family and burned their house with the bodies in each bed, they bury cantrell; the reverend clawson preaching the funeral. katy deere then soon decides to leave the group, going out on her own. jacky is saddened by this but allows katy to leave. later that night, a horrible storm passes through and knocks jacky off the showboat into the waters below. within a day or so, jacky winds up in the port of new orleans, at long last. without a clue on how her crew is or how to navigate new orleans, she goes looking for the house of the rising sun, a brothel and a casino that the ever-so mysterious mam'selle. jacky stays with mam'selle claudelle de bourbon, whom she had met in boston and who practices "the oldest profession", until she finds jaimy. jacky is almost murdered simultaneously by mike fink because she stole his boat, british lieutenant flashby (a minor character from the second book), because he wants the prize money for jacky's head, and the pirate brothers lafitte because jacky stole quite a bit of loot from them during her time as a privateer. she manages to escape them all and buys a small ship so that, with the help of her newly-reunited crew, she can get to jaimy, who is in jamaica. she finds him there, all is forgiven, and jaimy sets off for china for a year or so because he is once again in the royal navy. though some of her crew choose to marry and become pioneers, and others choose to marry and run a floating tavern docked at new orleans, jacky and the remainder of her crew leave for boston after setting jaimy off in kingston, jamaica. =characters= * jacky faber- the main protagonist of the entire series;

part 1: revelations the story picks up following the events of freefall. in the world with its own sun in the centre of the earth, the rebecca twins had dived into a pool in order to escape an explosion set off by will and elliott, and eventually are able to survive by breathing air they find trapped in the roof of some underground workings. chester and martha return topsoil, where chester is inevitably very eager to contact his parents, but martha won't permit this. she dotes obsessively on the boy, seeing him as a substitute for her dead son. this frightens chester, who begins to make a plan to run away from her, but in the event doesn't dare put this into practice. meanwhile, back in the centre of the planet, the rebeccas come across a modern metropolis, with helicopters and other vehicles, including cars resembling volkswagens. the point of interest flips back to chester, when they are walking through the night. suddenly, martha grabs him, and chester panics, going as far as to hit her. when he demands an explanation, she claims she was shielding him from a bright. under the surface, rebecca two sees a limiter flare, and then signals back by blowing up a gas tank. the rebeccas then continue to march toward the city. the story returns to chester, who wakes up, finding martha, who just killed a bird. he and martha eat the bird. the rebeccas find the city, and realise it is well maintained and populated. they frighten a small amount of people, and that results in the arrival of the local army. the people of the city are from a expeditionary force that arrived during world war ii. the limiter forces arrive shortly, and a short staredown occurs, and after a limiter medic begins to operate on the wounded rebecca. the other rebecca and the limiter general begin to talk about their identity. during the second world war, the styx were allies of the third reich. the officer of the squad informs the other two that they are "new germanians". the officer takes rebecca and the limiter general to meet the chancellor of new germania. back topsoil, chester's food that martha is feeding him makes him sick. they enter a small cottage that is unattended. they discover that it is well kept, and has various foods. chester eats some cold beans, and takes a shower. he then returns to the kitchen, after getting some new clothes. he begins to call his parents, when he is hit in the back of the head and knocked out. the story shifts to drake, who wakes up in a room he does not recognize. he heads to a window, and realises that he is still topsoil. he is then greeted by his savior, a retired limiter named edward james green, who believes that the styx are taking unnecessary measures with their goal of reclaiming topsoil. he also reveals himself to be elliott's father. they then discuss various aspects of the limiter, who is coined "eddie" by drake. after finishing, they head for a keypad-locked cellar. the story then flips to will, dr. burrows, and elliott. they discover a group of skulls, which prove that there are native inhabitants. dr. burrows also claims to have seen a stuka. elliott prepared some early warning systems in case of limiters or other people. she also prepares a hidaway for them to run to in case of danger, and shows will the ancient passage the rebeccas used to enter the inner world, also finding evidence that limiters have been there recently. meanwhile, eddie and drake enter the cellar, and drake discovers an area akin to a briefing room. he discovers various styx elements, including a dark light and the device used to incapacitate him in the commons. eddie then leaves drake, giving him keys to the warehouse and the apartment. back underground, will and elliott find free time together, but are soon interrupted by dr. burrows, who is investigating the pyramid area, against precaution by will and elliott. back topsoil, chester is held hostage by martha, and is fed a mystery meat. drake and eddie eventually find him, but he is revolted when he finds he was eating meat from dead mailmen, whom martha killed. back in the colony, mrs. burrows is kept alive by the second officer, but her presence in the house begins to make his family very unpopular. she slowly regains motor control of her body, but her sight has been badly impaired and she compensates this by utilising an olfactory super-sense that she finds that she has developed. the family begins to consider ways of killing her. back topsoil, chester meets eddie, and wants to return to his parents. the prime minister, meanwhile, is dark lit. the rebeccas also convince the chancellor of new germania to let them use the helicopters to search for will, dr. burrows and elliott. part 2: contact the rebeccas find that tom cox is still alive, and with them. the chancellor then assigns colonel bismarck to assist them. they board helicopters, and head for the pyramids. they find will and dr. burrows, and capture them. elliott watches the scene from high in one of the giant trees of the jungle, and before cox manages to slice off will's fingers at the behest of the rebeccas, she shoots and kills him. the rebeccas are angered by this, and the shoot dr. burrows as retaliation. they then demand that elliott surrenders and hands over the dominion virus, as they found the broken phial containing the vaccine. elliott comes up with a plan, and approaches with a suicide bomber kit. she then forces the rebeccas to let them go, in exchange for the virus. they agree, and the exchange is carried out just as will and elliott are leaving on a helicopter with colonel bismarck. meanwhile, eddie informs drake that the styx obtain their viruses from "plague snails" that live in the eternal city. chester's attempt to contact his parents goes horribly wrong as the styx have brainwashed them to not recognize him and to call one of their agents if he appears. part 3: restitution colonel bismark cannot land will and elliott at their supply cache in the jungle due to one of the inner world's frequent storms, and lands them as close to the location as possible. once landed, will confronts elliott, asking her why she gave the styx the virus. she tells him that she has the vaccine that she drank it before breaking the phiall. meanwhile, chester and drake deprogram chester's parents, who've been brainwashed by the styx. eddie and drake also inspect a portal into the underworld, in preparation for an underground operation. also, the rebecca twins and their limiters take the new germanians assigned to support them prisoner as part of their plan to take over new germania. as they brainwash the captives, it becomes evident that one of the rebecca twins is infatuated with the new germanian officer that they first met when they arrived at the city. will and elliott retrieve their weapons and supplies and start making their way through the ancient passage to the fallout shelter. in the colony, the old styx tells the second officer that he should be prepared for the styx to take mrs. burrows to the scientists to be examined to see how she resisted the styx's dark light battery for so long. part 4 : on the offensive drake and eddie leave the warehouse to place pesticides that will annihilate the plague snails in the eternal city, leaving chester behind to watch movies. meanwhile, the second officer's family rejoices when the supposedly comatose mrs. burrows is taken to have her brain examined by the scientists. colly, the family's hunter that mrs. burrows befriended, hisses at them, and they cannot understand why she is upset.will and elliot make their way to the fallout shelter, but are stranded there because chester and martha took the only intact boat. at the warehouse, chester calls his dad to tell him that their part in drake's plan is ready, but he finds that his mother has disappeared. he tells him that the plan has not changed, and the last place he wants to be is at the hotel if emily rawls has indeed fallen under the power of the styx. drake and eddie place the charges and detonate them, releasing a cloud of pesticide that will destroy the plaque snails. chester and jeff rawls make their way to the portal, and jeff goes to the warehouse after chester has found the portal and begun to unpack the equipment drake had him to bring with him: two bergens, some firearms, and a noddy suit. after fighting their way through a styx patrol, drake attacks eddie, knocking him unconscious. he did this partly because while eddie was working for the styx, he tortured and killed a close friend of drake's, and then lied about the incident to drake; but mostly because eddie would not consent to what drake and chester were about to do next. meanwhile, the rebecca twins finish their takeover of new germania. drake and chester make their way through the labyrinth, and attack the south cavern's air supply, piping in nerve gas (which was in one of the bergens that chester brought down into the underworld) to incapacitate as many colonists as possible, so they will not interfere in the next part of the mission. meanwhile, the second officer and colly go to the laboratories to make a last visit to mrs. burrows. drake and chester arrive at the laboratories, tranquilizing any colonists the nerve gas didn't incapacitate and plant explosives (which were in the other bergen) in the north block, which specializes in weapons and biological warfare research. drake and chester search the building for any topsoilers being captive in there. chester finds the second officer and fights with him, as chester believes the second officer was complicit in chester's torture, and the second officer has a grudge against will and his friends because will knocked him unconscious during the unsuccessful attempt to rescue chester from the hold. mrs. burrows stops pretending to be unconscious to break up the fight, but eddie (now recovered) locks them in the operating theater. eddie then paralyses drake with the dark light training eddie gave him while drake was a prisoner of the styx. eddie tells drake, who is still conscious, only unable to move, that his manipulations have been indirectly responsible for most of the plotlines in the series, and that he had misjudged how events would play out. he tells drake that he wants drake and his friends to win so he can take control of the styx. he then knocks drake unconscious and leaves. the second officer, chester, and mrs. burrows unsuccessfully try to open the door until mrs. burrows tells colly to wake up drake so he can open the door. this succeeds, and they escape the north block only moments before it explodes. the second officer leaves the group, and mrs. burrows, chester, drake, and colly head for the surface. they head to eddie's warehouse to find that he has flown the coop, leaving behind only an unconscious jeff rawls. part 5 : reunion drake rescues will, bartleby and elliott from the fallout shelter, and takes them to the rest of the group are camping with a gypsy band. they then leave for a safe house. meanwhile, the rebecca twins return to the colony, presenting the old styx the dominion virus, their suspiscions that will or elliott drank the vaccine, and the new germainian army. the safe house is revealed to be a country estate owned by drake's father, parry. mrs. rawls, in highfield, is not under the influence of the styx as it initially appeared, but is only pretending to be darklit so she can spy on the styx for drake. eddie appears, foiling an attempt to make her place a bomb for the styx, and takes her away from highfield. drake returns from town one morning with two things: a skateboard for chester and a book based on dr. burrows's journal for will. will is devastated when he learns that the book, the highfield mole, is not a serious academic work but a novel to amuse children. in the epilogue, a news report about the closure of the three hospitals to which drake provided samples of elliott's blood is interrupted by a bulletin about a styx attack on the royal mint, and that the police (who, along with the rest of the government, are being manipulated by the styx) believe the mastermind behind the plot is drake. errata *in freefall, the rebecca twin with the broken teeth was referred to as "rebecca two"; in closer, she was "rebecca one." ||| 2 ||| 2
mrs. rachel bruner inherited a large real estate investment business from her husband, and has run it successfully for some time. she has read the fbi nobody knows and thinks it should get a wider distribution than it has so far. mrs. bruner has attracted the bureau's attention by buying 10,000 copies of the book and sending them to persons of influence, including cabinet members, supreme court justices, members of congress, various state legislators, heads of corporations and banks, and so on. mrs. bruner believes that, in retaliation, the fbi is following her and her family, that it has tapped her phones, and that it has questioned some of her employees. she blames the bureau's director, j. edgar hoover, and she wants wolfe to stop him. wolfe accepts the job, over archie's objections. archie believes that the task is an impossible one and that taking it on will make a powerful enemy of the fbi. but mrs. bruner has offered a $100,000 retainer, and will pay both expenses and a fee to be determined by wolfe, contingent on a successful outcome. wolfe will not return the retainer. to do so would be to imply that he is afraid of what he terms a "bully." wolfe plans to get evidence of fbi malfeasance and use it to force the fbi to leave mrs. bruner alone. at first, archie pursues various leads with little success, but then doc vollmer conveys to archie a message that calls him to a meeting in a hotel room, and that warns him to "be sure you're loose." although suspicious of being set up by the fbi, archie goes to the hotel room, where he finds inspector cramer and a carton of milk. cramer has news, but he doesn't want it known that he's passed it along to wolfe – hence the secret meeting. the fbi knows by now that wolfe has accepted mrs. bruner's job and it has asked the state government to revoke wolfe's and archie's licenses to do business as private investigators. in turn, the state has asked the police commissioner for whatever negative information he has on wolfe, and the commissioner has asked cramer for a report. cramer knows that wolfe has already annoyed the fbi, but before he writes the report he wants the full picture. archie surmises that cramer brought the milk, archie's beverage of choice, to show that he's not eager to cooperate with the fbi's plan to harass wolfe. archie is at first undecided. normally he would check with wolfe before opening up to cramer, but he can't – their phone's surely tapped. archie's intelligence, guided by experience, tells him to empty the bag for cramer, and he does so. then cramer completes his own agenda by giving archie some unpublished information about the recent, unsolved murder of morris althaus, shot to death in his apartment. althaus was a free-lance magazine writer and it is known that he had been preparing an article on the fbi. however, neither a draft of an article nor background information was found in his apartment. (not even the bullet that killed him was found, although evidence indicates that the bullet passed through his chest, hit the wall and fell to the floor.) furthermore, an eyewitness saw men leaving the scene and got their car's license number, which cramer says belongs to the fbi. cramer's inference is that fbi agents entered althaus' apartment for a search, that they were surprised to find him there, that althaus threatened them with his own gun and that they shot him. cramer has tried to get the fbi's cooperation in his investigation, but its special agent in charge in new york, richard wragg, stonewalls him. with no evidence and no cooperation from the fbi, cramer is both blocked and seriously angry. later, in conference with wolfe, archie conjectures that cramer "… knew we had stung them somehow, and he had a murder he couldn't tag them for, and he decided to hand it to you." archie and wolfe agree that, even if they were able to establish that the fbi was responsible for althaus' death, it wouldn't help them complete their job for mrs. bruner. the only leverage they would have would be to trade their silence about the murder for the fbi's agreement to stop harassing mrs. bruner. that's not wolfe's style. so wolfe chooses to demonstrate instead that the fbi did not kill althaus. but he still needs leverage, and he decides that the best way to obtain it is to entice the fbi into an illegal entry. wolfe enlists the help of his old friend lewis hewitt, a millionaire orchid fancier with an estate on long island. hewitt will host a dinner of the ten for aristology, a group of gourmets (one that also figures in "poison à la carte"). the publicity given the newspapers states that wolfe and archie will attend and that fritz will prepare the dinner. two actors who strongly resemble wolfe and archie in superficial physical respects go in their place, thereby giving any fbi agents who might be watching the brownstone the impression that it is unoccupied. in fact it is not: wolfe and archie remain hidden in the darkened house; also present are saul panzer, fred durkin and orrie cather, who were smuggled, along with the actors, into the house the day before. meantime, archie, acting on his own, has located evidence pointing to the identity of althaus' actual murderer. to secure the evidence, though, he has to leave it roughly where he found it. the situation preys on archie's nerves: the timing of wolfe's trap forces archie to wait for a couple of days, and he worries that the murderer will decide to dispose of the evidence permanently. wolfe's plan to trap the fbi works as intended, and wolfe catches two of its agents inside his house, with witnesses who can testify that they broke in. he allows the agents to leave, but only after appropriating their credentials, which fbi agents are permitted to display but not to relinquish. when archie later describes this scene to inspector cramer, he sees a rare and broad smile crease the inspector's face. the credentials provide the leverage wolfe needs to complete his job for mrs bruner. wragg comes to wolfe's office. wolfe engages to leave the credentials in a safe deposit box and take no action against the fbi, if the harassment of mrs. bruner, her family and her employees stops. wragg agrees. and as to the murder, archie is at last able to tell cramer that the fbi did not in fact kill althaus, and where the evidence identifying althaus' murderer can be found. wragg then hands over the missing bullet, taken by the agents who searched the apartment, so that cramer can close the case without having to put any of wragg's men on the witness stand at a trial. in the final scene, a new visitor arrives at the front door. though he is not mentioned by name, archie refers to him as "the big fish," suggesting that j. edgar hoover has come in person to retrieve the agents' credentials. wolfe refuses to let him in, leaving him to keep ringing the doorbell. ||| 6 ||| 6
the story begins in london during the summer of 1900. two children, digory kirke and polly plummer, meet while playing in the adjacent gardens of a row of terraced houses. they decide to explore the attic connecting the houses, but take the wrong door and surprise digory's uncle andrew in his study. uncle andrew tricks polly into touching a yellow magic ring, causing her to vanish. then he explains to digory that he has been dabbling in magic, and that the rings allow travel between one world and another. he persuades digory, effectively through blackmail, to take another yellow ring to follow wherever polly has gone, and two green rings so that both can return. digory finds himself transported to a sleepy woodland with an almost narcotic effect; he finds polly nearby. the woodland is filled with pools. digory and polly surmise that the world is not really a proper world at all but a "wood between the worlds," similar to the attic that links their rowhouses back in england, and that each pool leads to a separate universe. they decide to explore a different world before returning to england, and jump into one of the nearby pools. they then find themselves in a desolate abandoned city of the ancient world of charn. inside the ruined palace, they discover statuesque figures of charn's former kings and queens, which degenerate from the fair and wise to the unhappy and cruel. they find a bell with a hammer, with these words: make your choice, adventurous stranger strike the bell and bide the danger or wonder, till it drives you mad what would have followed if you had despite protests from polly, digory rings the bell. this awakens the last of the statues, a witch named jadis, who, to avoid defeat in battle, had deliberately killed every living thing in charn by speaking a &#34;deplorable word.&#34; as the only survivor left in her world, she placed herself in an enchanted sleep that would only be broken by someone ringing the bell. the children realize jadis&#39;s evil nature and attempt to flee, but she follows them back to england by clinging to them as they clutch their rings. in england, she dismisses uncle andrew as a mere dabbler in magic. she discovers that her magic does not work in england but she still has her strength. she enslaves uncle andrew and orders him to fetch her a chariot, so she can set about conquering earth. they leave, and she returns standing atop a hansom with no driver, followed by a fire engine. there is a collision at the front door of the kirke house, and police arrive. jadis breaks off a rod from a nearby lamp-post and brandishes it as a weapon. polly and digory grab her and put on their magic rings to take her out of their world, dragging with them uncle andrew, frank the cab-driver, and frank&#39;s horse, since all were touching one another when digory and polly grabbed their rings. in the wood between the worlds they jump into a pool, hoping it leads back to charn. instead they stumble into a dark void that jadis recognizes as a world not yet created. they then all witness the creation of a new world by the lion aslan, who brings various entities, stars, plants, and animals, into existence as he sings. jadis attempts to kill aslan with the iron bar from the lamp-post, but it deflects harmlessly off of him and begins to sprout into a new lamp-post &#34;tree.&#34; jadis flees. aslan gives some animals the power of speech, commanding them to use it for justice and merriment. digory&#39;s uncle is frozen with fear and unable to communicate with the talking animals, who mistake him for a kind of tree. aslan confronts digory with his responsibility for bringing jadis into his young world, and tells digory he must atone by helping to protect narnia from her evil. aslan transforms the cabbie&#39;s horse into a winged horse named fledge, and digory and polly fly on him to a garden high in the mountains. digory&#39;s task is to take an apple from a tree in this garden, and plant it in narnia. in the garden digory finds a sign reading: come in my gold gates or not at all take of my fruit for others or forbear for those who steal or those who climb my wall shall find their heart's desire and find despair digory picks one of the apples for his mission, but has to resist temptation to eat one for himself after he smells the apples. as he prepares to leave he is shocked to see the witch jadis. she has eaten one of the magic apples, thereby becoming immortal, but her face is now &#34;deadly white;&#34; digory begins to understand what the last line in the sign means. she tempts digory to either eat an apple himself and join her in immortality, or steal one back to earth to heal his dying mother. digory resists temptation, knowing that his mother would never condone theft. however the clincher comes when the witch suggests he leave polly behind, not knowing polly can get away by her own ring. at this, digory sees through the witch&#39;s ploy. foiled, the witch departs for the north. digory returns to narnia with an apple, which is planted in narnian soil. a new tree springs up, which aslan says will repel the witch for centuries to come. aslan informs digory that a stolen apple would have healed his mother, but at a terrible price: anyone who steals the apples gets their heart&#39;s desire, but it comes in a form that makes it unlikeable. in the case of the witch, she now has her heart&#39;s desire for immortality, but it only means eternal misery because of her evil heart. moreover, the magic apples are now a horror to her, which is why the tree repels her. with aslan&#39;s permission, digory then takes an apple from the new tree to heal his mother. aslan promises the apple will now bring joy. aslan returns digory, polly, and uncle andrew to england; frank and his wife, helen (transported from england by aslan) stay to rule narnia as its first king and queen. digory&#39;s apple restores his dying mother to health, and he and polly remain lifelong friends. uncle andrew reforms and gives up magic but he still enjoys bragging about his adventures with the witch on their tour of london. digory plants the apple&#39;s core, together with uncle andrew&#39;s magic rings, in the back yard of his aunt&#39;s home in london. years later the tree that grows from it blows down in a storm. digory has its wood made into a wardrobe, thus linking the story to the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, in which digory has become the old professor in whose country house lucy pevensie finds the wardrobe and the way into narnia. ||| 0 ||| 2

at the end of witches abroad, magrat garlick, nanny ogg and granny weatherwax (and greebo) left genua bound for home, in lancre. lords and ladies begins as they arrive back. magrat makes her way to lancre castle, where she meets king verence ii of lancre with whom she has a definite understanding that they may want to be in a relationship. however, he surprises her by informing her that the two of them are about to be married, and that he has arranged the whole wedding, including things such as the wedding dress, guest list, entertainment, date and time without her involvement. following an argument with granny weatherwax, magrat moves into lancre castle with verence (though not in the same room - yet) prior to the wedding, ignoring any question of scandal. granny discovers that there has been some sort of magic performed at a circle of stones, on the edge of lancre. these stones contain "the love of iron", which attracts all iron to them, preventing any iron from passing through. this circle is also a gateway between the discworld and the land of the elves. usually, this gateway is strong, but at certain times, known as "circle time", the barrier becomes less potent. circle time is easily recognised by the arrival of crop circles in areas near to the stone circle. it is implied that if a crop circle should open inside the stone circle, the barrier would collapse. granny and nanny ogg discover that the young women practising witchcraft near the stone circle are local girls led by diamanda tockley, and including agnes nitt (who will become a witch in a later story). the two elderly witches try to convince them to stop, but they are ignored and eventually, diamanda runs through the stone circle into the land of the elves, followed by granny weatherwax. when the two see the elves for what they really are, they attempt to escape, but diamanda is shot by a stone-tipped arrow. granny picks her up and they escape into lancre, followed by an elf who manages to escape as well. just as the elf is about to kill granny, he is knocked out by nanny ogg who arrives just in time. granny and nanny take diamanda and the captured elf to lancre castle, where granny leaves diamanda to the nursing of magrat. they then put the elf in the castle dungeon, surrounded by iron, since elves hate the touch of iron as it limits their power. shawn ogg, guard, privy cleaner, fanfare blower and general (or private) dogsbody of lancre castle is given the task of keeping the elf locked up and diamanda safe from the elves, whilst the guests to the wedding of magrat and verence go to see the entertainment (a play), which is unexpectedly staged near the stone circle. the three witches are not at the entertainment for different reasons; magrat does not go because she has found a letter in verence's bedroom which angers her (the details of the letter are not disclosed at this point), granny does not go because she has been whisked away from the castle in a moment of passion by mustrum ridcully, archchancellor of unseen university who is a guest at the wedding (he has brought the librarian, ponder stibbons and the bursar along as well) and who was a former love interest for granny in their (much) younger days and nanny has been taken out to dinner by casanunda (whom she first met during witches abroad). the play causes sufficient belief that the barrier in the stone circle is broken and the elves come through. using a kind of hypnosis, they coerce the lancrastrians to pull down the stone circle and take control of verence, whom the queen of the elves intends to marry in order to make her rule of lancre official. magrat, having escaped from the castle (where she was chased by the elf after it was released by the hypnotised diamanda tockley) arrives in a suit of armour belonging to a previous queen of lancre called ynci (the short-tempered). she attacks the elf queen, but is beaten. granny, who has been captured by the elves attacks the queen with magic, but it seems to overcome her and she collapses to the ground, whereon her bees swarm from their hive and land on the prone body. since the queen's attention is taken up by granny weatherwax, her hold on magrat is lessened. the young queen-to-be attacks the elf queen and, with help from the elf queen's real husband (who was called on to help by nanny ogg and casanunda) the elf queen is defeated and the elves vanish back to their land. granny weatherwax appears to be dead and the two remaining witches go to her cottage to look around and read her will. however, they find a note, left by granny, which indicates that she may, in fact, still be alive. they rush back to the castle and break a window, upon which grannys' bees land on her again. it transpires that she has been "borrowing" the hive mind of the bees to escape the elf queen and give magrat her chance to defeat her. granny is the first witch to successfully "borrow" the hive mind, since this involves splitting your mind over dozens of bees (as opposed to borrowing the single mind of other animals). magrat and verence are married (despite the letter, which was written by granny whilst the three witches were away, urging him to organise the marriage to magrat, so as to stop her from getting in the way of her own life). later, the playwright, hwel arrives and writes a play based on the story (ignoring the parts that were too expensive to put on a stage, or which he didn't believe). he called the play the "taming of the vole", since he didn't think anyone would want to see a play called "things that happened on a midsummer night". ||| 2 ||| 2
as in the other pendragon books, this book covers bobby's adventure and those of mark and courtney, his friends on second earth. bobby's adventures are chronicled as an epistolary novel and those of his friends in the third-person narrative. the story starts after bobby pendragon has spoken with loor, who explains to him, the lead traveler and main character, the situation on zadaa, introduces bobby to her sister and her acolyte saangi and her friends, bokka and teek. soon afterwards, saint dane, who is disguised as a batu warrior, beats bobby up with a wooden staff. bobby is almost killed but is rescued by pelle a zinj, the kind prince, and recovers quickly in a batu hospital. after bobby has recovered, he decides to start training to be a warrior. alder, the traveler from denduron, joins loor and saangi to help train him. for a month, bobby works hard in a deserted training camp. finally, at the end of the month, they all celebrate his successful training but are interrupted by an attack by a group of rokador, who shoots bokka with an arrow and flee. as bokka dies, he gives bobby and loor a map to the underground city kidik, and tell them that saint dane is there. loor and bobby decide to attend the batu festival of azhra first, because pelle a zinj has invited them personally. at the festival, pelle a zinj is killed by a rokador. after this, it rains, but still there is no ready supply water for the batu. this convinces the batu that the rokador are indeed holding back the water and they start making preparations for war. meanwhile, bobby and loor begin their journey to the city of kidik. there, they find an underground ocean of fresh water. they take a boat across this, arriving on an island where saint dane captures them and puts them in a prison-like room. bobby and loor later escape and learn that after an epidemic virus had killed most of the rokador, saint dane was able to convince the survivors to attack the batu. the plans was to hold back the water, making the batu starve; when the batu attacked, the rokador would flood the entire village, drowning all. saangi and alder join bobby and loor. as the rokador prepare to flood the underground, the protagonists foil their plans by flooding it prematurely, presumably to the ruin of both tribes. rather than abandon one another, warriors of both tribes co-operate to escape the flood. the heroes escape from the floods by riding a 'dygo', the machine that the rokador use for making tunnels. all the water shoots out from the underground and creates a river which flows by the city of xhaxhu, providing water for both people. bobby then returns to loor's house, where he attempts to share a kiss with her. she refuses him, arguing that to become lovebirds would distract them from their purpose of preventing the destruction of halla. bobby accepts this without complaint. bobby goes back to the flume to try to return to second earth (earth in modern-times), whereupon saint dane comes out of the flume in a fury and kills loor with a sword. he then tries to kill bobby, but bobby uses his training to disarm him. bobby then raises the same sword that killed loor as saint dane jumped on top of him, impaling him in a way that should have killed him. however, saint dane disappears and reappears at the entrance to the flume, proving the suggestion given in earlier books that he cannot be killed. saint dane then travels to a territory called quillan. bobby goes back to loor. his own desire that she live rather than die appears to resurrect or revive her, in that her wound closes of its own accord while she resumes full faculty, memory, and mobility. moments later, bobby gets a message from quillan from people named veego and laberge; to investigate this, he embarks for quillan. the story ends with him writing his record in what is revealed to be the residence of those who sent him the message. the story begins when mark and courtney have realized that they have accidentally destroyed the flume to eelong trying to help bobby. courtney therefore becomes severely depressed and stops coming to school. eventually she decides to go to summer school for six weeks in order to recover, so that mark is left to read bobby's journals alone. throughout the summer, mark collects bobby's journals and reads them, and begins to have conversations with andy mitchell, the former school bully. mark soon realizes that mitchell is an adept in mathematics and became a bully for having been a misfit. gradually mark and mitchell become friends. at her summer school, courtney meets a boy named whitney wilcox, whom she befriends and of whom she begins to entertain romantic thoughts. before long, he invites her out for pizza. en route, she is struck down by a black car which seems to have been following her. from the car emerges whitney, who is here revealed to be saint dane. looking upon courtney, he remarks cryptically "i give, and i take away" and departs in the form of a raven. as courtney loses consciousness as a result of her injuries, she sends a cellphone message to mark, who upon inferring that she is in danger convinces andy mitchell to drive him to courtney's summer school. there they find courtney, badly injured and unconscious. they call the local ambulance and hurry courtney to the hospital. courtney slowly begins to recover. in the last scene of the book, courtney's heart rate suddenly begins to slow, whereupon andy mitchell, unseen, brings it to normal by a means, implied, to be the same kind of "thing" used by bobby to revive loor. this suggests that andy mitchell is another alter-ego assumed by saint dane. ||| 2 ||| 2
detective harry bosch is pursuing "the dollmaker", a serial killer who uses makeup to paint his victims. he gets a tip from a prostitute that a recent customer of hers, norman church, had a large amount of women's makeup in his bathroom. bosch goes to church's garage, identifies himself as police, breaks in the door. church is naked and shaved. bosch tells him to not move, but church starts to pull something from under his pillow, and bosch shoots him. bosch is investigated by internal affairs and cleared in the shooting; but, since he did not follow police procedure, he is transferred from the elite robbery-homicide division (rhd) back to the hollywood table. the makeup is found to match those of nine of the dollmaker's victims. four years later, bosch is sued by church's widow. her attorney portrays bosch as a cowboy and a vigilante, seeking revenge for the unsolved murder of his mother when he was a child. during the trial, the police receive a note, purportedly from the dollmaker, which leads to the discovery of a new victim with the same modus operandi. this victim was encased in concrete, unlike the original eleven victims, but all other aspects of the killing are the same, including the signature cross painted on a toenail. the concrete blonde victim, along with two other of the original victims, fit a different pattern: large-breasted blondes in the local adult entertainment industry who also advertise as high-class prostitutes in the local sex rags. bosch and his task force suspect that "the follower" is detective mora from ad-vice. mora has ties to the adult video industry, had insider knowledge of the dollmaker case, and was not at work during the killings not attributed to norman church. the task force put mora under surveillance and bosch breaks into mora's house looking for evidence that he is the follower. instead he finds that mora has been making pornographic movies with underage children. mora returns to his house, finds bosch and threatens to kill him. the rest of the task force arrive; they search mora's house and determine that he is not the follower. mora does have information on who he believes is the follower, and makes a deal: he provides the name of professor locke, agrees to quit the police force, and all of his crimes will be ignored. mora got information that locke had been seen on the set of adult movies where the slain women were cast members. when bosch returns to his office he finds another note from the follower, saying that he will be taking 'his blonde'. bosch assumes that he means his girlfriend sylvia; when she does not answer her phone, he sends the police to her house. he arrives to an empty house, when a real estate agent shows up to show the house. bosch finds sylvia at his house and takes her to a hotel to protect her. sylvia tells bosch that they must have some time apart for her to decide if she can live with him and his dangerous job. the next day bosch returns to court as the jury is to restart their deliberations. honey chandler, the widow's attorney, does not appear. bosch sends the police to her house as she is also a blonde. the jury reaches a verdict for the plaintiff and awards compensatory damages of one dollar and punitive damages of one dollar to church's widow. when bosch finally arrives at chandler's house she has been dead 48 hours, killed in the same manner as the other dollmaker killings, except that she also has burn and bite marks all over her body. locke, who had been missing for several days, shows up at the crime scene. bosch and edgar interrogate him but discover that he has a solid alibi and dismiss him as a suspect. bosch follows bremmer from the crime scene to his house. he asks bremmer if he can come in for a drink to discuss his court case. when bremmer returns with two beers bosch confronts him as being the follower. bremmer fights bosch and gets control of his gun. bosch, playing on bremmer's pride, gets him to confess. bosch had found a note that the follower had mailed to chandler, which mentioned an article in the los angeles times. bosch had noticed that it had been mailed before that article was published, which led him to suspect bremmer. bremmer had tortured chandler to find out where she had hidden the note and envelope. bremmer attempts to shoot bosch but the gun is empty; bosch grabs the magazine he had hidden in his sock, hits bremmer with it and arrests him. bosch had hidden a recording device in the room while bremmer was getting the beer. the next day bosch forces the district attorney's office to charge bremmer with first degree murder, as the filing attorney is not satisfied with the amount of evidence. the police then obtain a warrant to obtain blood, hair and teeth molds of bremmer;

among us live the others. they are humans who can enter the twilight, a shadowy world that exists alongside our real world, and gain unnatural powers from it. as long as they are in the twilight, others are drained of their life essence and may be consumed if they remain in it for too long. others are made up of two distinct groups- the light others and dark others. a long time ago, the light and dark others fought a fierce battle in which neither side could win. in the end, both sides signed a great treaty- a set of laws which would govern them and the use of powers. light others created night watch, to ensure that the dark others wouldn't break the treaty while dark others created day watch, to watch the light others as well. both sides answer to the inquisition&mdash;an organisation which ensures that neither of the two sides become too powerful. the book is separated into three novellas: anton gorodetsky is assigned by gesser to investigate mysterious warning letters sent to both the watches and the inquisition. in the letters, a powerful great light other promises a human that they will turn him into an 'other', which the human deeply desires. however, as far as the others are concerned this is impossible and as such, the light other is in danger because refusal to fulfill this human's request means that he or she will dematerialise in the twilight. anton is assigned the case and goes to the assol, a rich district in moscow where the letters came from. vampire kostya saushkin from the day watch has also been assigned to the case, along with edgar and vitezislav from the inquisition. anton discovers that the human is a 60-year old businessman, the son of gesser. the four confront gesser about making the promise to turn his son into an other but gesser denies even knowing his son was alive. it is then revealed that his son is a potential other for whom gesser claims the right to initiate. it is revealed later in the book that the witch, arina, used the book of fuaran to transform gesser's son into an other. anton joins his wife svetlana (who left the night watch), her mother, and their daughter (nadya) on a vacation in a remote area. whilst there, he learns an incident where werewolves tried attacked two human children but who were saved by a mysterious woman living in the forest. anton magically reads the older girl's memory, and notices that she saw a book titled "fuaran" on the shelf. anton can hardly believe it, as fuaran is a legendary and extremely powerful artifact, believed to be lost ages ago or maybe never to have existed at all. according to stories, the book, written by an ancient witch (named fuaran) contains a spell able to turn an ordinary human into an other. anton finds the witch's cottage and the witch, arina, who turns out to be level 1 or higher, but not fuaran. instead, all anton finds is a book about the legend of fuaran which is co-authored by arina. the book explains how fauran discovered how to raise the power of an other, and grant a human the powers of an other. according to the book, the average magical temperature of the world was 97 degrees, while humans had a magical temperature of 97 or higher. their warmth is fed into their surroundings, while the others have a magical temperature under 97, and thus soak up the 'warmth' that surrounded them. the lower an others magical temperature, the more they soaked up. seventh level others had a magical temperature of about 90, while others without classification where in the 40s. the rarest type of other is one who had no magical temperature at all, a zero other, who's power was near limitless due to the fact they only absorbed magic. after a talk with svetlana, anton discovers nadya is an absolute zero other. later, as anton is relaxing in a hammock, he opens his eyes to find edgar (an inquisitor) standing over him. edgar explains to anton that arina was wanted for questioning. in turns out the witch played a major role in a joint watch experiment to create the perfect socialist state in the 20s. arina was meant to put a potion in the bread that, over time, would cause whoever ate it to fully believe in newly arising government. instead, all the subjects were turned quickly to the cause, which lead to the downfall of the government and the death of nearly all the subjects, supposedly due to the arina's intentional sabotage. confronted by anton and edgar, arina dives into the fourth level of the twilight, where it takes time before the pair manage to follow her, only to find that she had escaped. edgar and anton return to the real world and decide that it would not be smart to search a higher others house, as arina had proven herself to be. having lost their target, the duo split ways, edgar to get backup in order to find the witch and anton to return to his family. once back home sveta and anton learn that while sveta's mother was out in the forest with their daughter, her 'old friend' took their daughter for a walk. sveta and anton knew instantly it was arina, and through magical means contacted her. the inquisition had erected a dome to stop the witch from escaping, and she was holding nadya hostage with demands that they find her a means to escape. after sveta sends out magical means to search for nadya, which nearly blew anton away, and discovers nothing, the werewolves, who had felt sveta's power and were afraid she would come after them, showed up. it turned out to be a man in his twenties with three children. they admitted having seen where arina took nadya and agreed that as long as they were pardoned for hunting those children, they would help track down and fight arina. in the end, after a battle between arina and a very angry sveta, nadya is saved, and with no deaths. sveta, who traveled to arina via the fifth level of the twilight, seemed changed, as though she had a new understanding on life. after forcing arina to agree not to hurt any human or other unless in self-defense, sveta agreed to help her find a means to leave. anton later traveled to moscow in order to talk to gesar, at which point gesar received a phone call, asking him to go to the witches hut, where anton had only just been. after traveling there with anton through magical means, they meet kostya, edgar, zabulon and svetlana. vitezoslav's ashes have been found in a hidden room with no indication of who could have killed him, except that it would have to be someone powerful, as vitezoslav was a higher vampire. at first, they suspect arina. however, it soon turns out that the other who killed vitezoslav and took the book is kostya, who himself became a higher vampire after drinking a blood cocktail made from donors in order to raise a vampire to this max potential (a mix of blood from 12 donors). originally, vitezoslav found the book and phoned edgar, who didn't believe the vampire had found the actual book of fuaran. but kostya wasn't convinced the book was a fake and join vitezoslav at the hut. the inquisitor wanted to see if the book actually worked and tried it on kostya, using his cocktail of a blood mixture made from 12 donors, increasing his powers exponentially, after which kostya challenged vitezoslav to a vampire duel. the loser of such a duel is ashed. his ultimate goal is to travel to the international space station and read the book while looking at the earth from orbit (the spell of fuaran works on everyone in the caster's range of sight), turning all humans into others, so at last he will not be different from the rest. all but kostya realize that this will be a disaster - "you step on someone's foot in a tram, he curses at you; now he can incinerate you." also, what most others do not realize is that it is, in fact, humans who emit magical energy. the others absorb it more than they emit, allowing them to use it. the magic level of an other depends on the absorb/emit ratio. there were several "zero" others in history: jesus (yehoshua), merlin, and anton and svetlana's daughter. their power is nearly unlimited as all they do is absorb magic. if kostya manages to turn all humans into others, the amount of magic energy available will drastically decrease. to demonstrate the effectiveness of "fuaran" to anton, he uses it on a human, turning him into a low-level other. what neither kostya nor anton realized at the moment was that anton was affected too - as he was standing right in front of kostya - turning him into a mage without classification (gesser/zabulon/sveta's level).kostya makes it to the baikonur cosmodrome and mind-controls the humans there to suit him up for the rocket launch. anton catches up and confronts him, with gesar, zabulon, and edgar all linked to his mind, and feeding him energy from everyone they have the right to leach it from. each is telling him to use a different destructive spell on the vampire. they realize that kostya is not planning to steal a rocket, as not even the higher vampire is capable of launching a rocket into orbit by himself. he is instead planning to open a portal to the space station. as a precaution, he is still putting on a spacesuit. however, when kostya was about to open the portal, anton took all the energy channeled into him by gesar, zabulon, and edgar and spent it to create a shield around himself in order to shield his thoughts from kostya. what anton did not want the vampire to realize was that because kostya was an other, an other without classification to boot, he would not be able to perform any magic in the vast emptiness of space. there would be no energy there from which he could draw on, in space he was separated from the source of all others energy. kostya, assuming the shield was put up because anton was afraid and wanted to protect himself from harm, expressed his surprise at such an act of cowardice and opened the portal. only when the vampire stepped through it did anton relax - the threat was over. it takes thousands of calculations to put a rocket into orbit. he knew that kostya could not possibly calculate the exact position of the station. the portal deposited kostya into orbit, leaving him to float in his spacesuit, unable to perform any magic. he could not make a corrective teleport into the space station, he could not open a portal back to the planet. he could only remain in orbit as that orbit decayed and he ended up burning up in the atmosphere upon re-entry, along with the book. with the death of kostya and others in the recent past, the day watch in moscow is down to one higher level magician (zavulon) while the night watch in moscow has four (gesar/olga/sveta/anton). ||| 2 ||| 2
the book follows an ensemble of protagonists who are investigating what first appear to be freak events related to the world's oceans. the book has several sub-plots and will occasionally follow minor unrelated characters to illustrate how events unfold around the globe. sigur johanson, a norwegian maritime biologist working at the norwegian university of science and technology in trondheim is asked to analyze a new species of marine worms. after several expeditions it becomes clear that the worms, together with bacteria, are destabilizing the methane clathrate in the continental shelf. when the continental slope collapses the subterranean landslide causes a tsunami that hits most of the north sea's coasts, killing millions and severely damaging the infrastructure in the coastal regions. at the same time leon anawak, a maritime scientist who investigates the behavior of whales and works for a whale watching company, makes startling observations in the whales' behavior. in addition, he is called to investigate an incident where whales and sea-borne mussels seemed to have attacked and incapacitated a commercial freighter. when he returns to his whale watching job, he witnesses how humpback whales and orcas attack the watcher's boats. the whales work together to capsize the boats and then kill the people drifting in the water. a large number of tourists and close colleagues of anawak are killed. the events that are witnessed by the protagonists are only part of a worldwide phenomenon. several other attacks are briefly described in the plot: swimmers are driven from the coast by sharks and venomous jellyfish. commercial ships are attacked and sometimes destroyed in a variety of ways. france sees an outbreak of an epidemic that is caused by lobsters contaminated with a highly lethal type of pfiesteria. when it becomes clear that all those events are related, an international scientific task force is created under the lead of the united states. the task force is led by lieutenant general judith li, a close friend and adviser to the president; the protagonists become part of it. while the task force is in session, the attacks on humanity continue: the north american east coast is overrun by pfiesteria-infested crabs that attack new york city, washington d.c. and later boston. the epidemic causes millions of deaths and renders the affected cities uninhabitable. the gulf stream has also ceased to exist, an event that may initiate a global climate change that would threaten human civilization. during a task force meeting, sigur johanson finally announces his hypothesis: the phenomena are intentional attacks by an unknown sentient species from the depths of the oceans; he states that this is the only logical conclusion, since the attacks are outside the power of any human agency and cannot be a natural phenomenon. johanson calls them "yrr", after three letters he typed randomly on his computer. the goal of the yrr is to eliminate the human race, which is devastating the earth's oceans. general li and a small group of scientists take to the sea on the helicopter carrier uss independence in an attempt to find the yrr and make contact with them. they discover that the yrr are single-cell organisms that operate in groups (or swarms, hence the novel's title), controlled by a single hive-mind that may have existed for hundreds of millions of years. the yrr form a collective intelligence and have inheritable memories that are passed on by manipulating parts of their dna. individual yrr recognize each other by using a specific pheromone. the scientists have some success in investigating the yrr and make limited contact. the attacks do not cease, however. sigur johanson also finds out that general li has not been honest with them. one of the scientists has been working on a modified pheromone to eradicate the yrr completely. johanson disagrees with this approach because the elimination of the yrr may completely destroy the maritime ecosystem and thus the human race. li, however, is unwilling to accept that dominance over the earth may not be a god-given birthright of mankind, and the united states in particular. she will rather take the risk than allow the us power to wane. while she gives orders to have johanson killed, the ship is attacked and crippled by the yrr and a final showdown ensues on the sinking independence. li races for the ship's midget submarines with two torpedoes containing the modified pheromone. the scientists are trying to stop her and at the same time implement their own plan to save humanity. she is stopped at the last moment by johanson who gives his own life to detonate the torpedoes and kill li. karen weaver, a scientific journalist, then manages to get hold of the last surviving submarine and dives into the depth of the oceans. there she releases a dead human pumped full of the yrr's natural pheromone, hoping to trigger an "emotional" response. this works and the yrr cease their attacks on humanity. the epilogue reveals that a year later, mankind is still recovering from the conflict with the swarm. the knowledge that humans are not the only intelligent lifeform on earth has plunged most religious groups into chaos, while parts of the world still suffer from the epidemic the yrr sent to destroy the threat to their marine homeland. humanity now faces the difficult task of rebuilding their society and industry without coming into conflict with the ever-watching superpower under the sea again. ||| 5 ||| 5
the book begins from the point of view of the mysterious stranger, also known as x, the renegade ethical who has been contacting people in the valley and enlisting their aid. he had posed as the engineer barry thorne on the airship parseval where he had murdered milton firebrass and several others, all of whom were fellow ethicals. he is now posing as a mayan named ah qaaq and is traveling in the company of the chinese poet li po. through his internal reverie he reveals some of his secrets. his identity had been discovered by monat grrautut, who was the director of the riverworld project. monat had recalled him to the dark tower to be judged. however, he used a remote command to kill all the inhabitants of the tower and stopped the resurrections so that agents in the valley could not return to the tower. stuck in the valley like the others he began to make his way upriver, hoping to catch a ride on one of the riverboats. his reverie ends on one of the most traumatic days on the riverworld. on that day the left bank grailstones fail to fire. they had done so once before, when the meteorite which sam clemens discovered, broke the circuit which powered them. that time the damage had been repaired by the ethicals. but this time they are all either dead or stuck in the valley. one day after the grailstones fail the inhabitants of the left bank invade the right en masse, half of humanity dies in the conflict. at the same time richard burton and his friends have joined the crew of king john's ship the rex grandissimus. they participate in the defense of the boat after the grailstones fail and burton, masquerading as a dark age british warrior, eventually becomes king john's security chief. one day tom mix, jack london, and peter jairus frigate apply to join the crew. burton, recognizing frigate, attacks him. realizing his mistake burton eventually becomes friendly with frigate and becomes an ally of mix and london. the false frigate has disappeared, but his travelling companion, monat grrautut, has boarded sam clemens' ship. shortly after boarding, monat is murdered by the renegade ethical. eventually the two riverboats reach virolando, a wide lake which is the last inhabited stretch before the headwaters. it is also home to the pacifist church of the second chance, where hermann göring has become a priest. king john and clemens finally get to square off. initially they begin with an aerial dog fight. when the planes are destroyed the two great riverboats attack each other. in the ensuing conflict both riverboats are sunk, most of the crews die, and the two captains are killed. king john is killed by clemens and clemens dies of a heart attack after being pulled from the water by his mortal enemy erik bloodaxe. clemens dies before he notices that bloodaxe has become an adherent of the church of the second chance, and seeks no revenge against clemens. among the survivors are burton, frigate, alice, kaz, joe miller, li po, ah qaaq, and nur ed din. they are joined by the american piano player tom turpin, the english novelist aphra behn, a man claiming to be gilgamesh, and the french soldier jean marcelin, baron de marbot. they take one of the ship's launches, the only craft to survive the fight, and proceed upriver. they scale the waterfall at the end of the river and make their way, after much difficulty, to the polar sea. when they arrive at the tower they unmask ah qaaq as the renegade ethical and take him prisoner. he explains his identity as loga, son of king priam of troy. like all children who died before age five, he was resurrected centuries ago and raised by the alien ethicals to be one of their agents. he reveals also the purpose of the riverworld. it is meant as a grand moral test, to allow humanity to progress to the point where they can achieve enlightenment. when the project is brought to a close the souls of those who have not achieved enlightenment will be set loose to wander the universe aimlessly. loga became obsessed with sparing his earthly family this fate and worked to sabotage the project. he was the one who awakened burton prematurely, recruited clemens and the others, and he used satellites to direct the meteorite to land near clemens. while this is all being revealed they discover that there is a problem with the computer which runs the tower. a part malfunctioned, and since no one was around to repair it the problem has reached a critical point. if nothing is done the computer will die, releasing all the stored wathans, or souls, of the people who died on the riverworld. without the wathans these people can never be brought back to life. in addition, monat has locked out other users from accessing the computer. göring, who had followed the group to the tower, attempts to fix the computer, but is killed by security measures put in place by monat. alice then devises a way to get around this programming, and deactivate the security. loga then is able to repair the computer. ||| 5 ||| 5
before the fact is the story of lina, a "born victim". she is raised in the country in the early decades of the 20th century and, at 28, she is still a virgin and in danger of becoming an old spinster. she finds country life with her parents rather boring, and only lives for strangers who might be passing through or who have been invited by someone living in or near their village. when the novel opens, such a stranger has just arrived: 27 year-old johnnie aysgarth, from an impoverished family who are, as she is told, "of rotten stock". general mclaidlaw, lina's father, is opposed to the marriage, and everyone seems to know that all that johnnie is after is lina's money. lina herself has been told from an early age that joyce, her younger sister, got the looks and she (lina) got the brains. in spite of these difficulties, lina and johnnie get married after only a short engagement. they go to paris on their honeymoon, where they stay at the best hotels and dine at the best restaurants, and, on their return, move into an eight-bedroom house in london. only six weeks later, johnnie, who is jobless, admits to his wife that they have been living on borrowed money and that it has run out. gradually, unwillingly, lina takes charge of the couple's finances and suggests that johnnie get a regular job. they leave the expensive house and move to the country; they settle down in a part of dorset where they know no one and start living in a more modest house. for the time being, they rely entirely on lina's allowance. reluctantly, johnnie takes a job as the steward of a large estate of a captain melbeck. lina always wanted to have children, but, as it turns out, she never gets pregnant. as time goes by, lina gradually learns that johnnie is a crook. apart from being a compulsive liar, he turns out to be * a thief: during a tennis party, he steals an expensive diamond belonging to one of the guests and, soon afterwards, a piece of lina's own jewelry. also, he sells lina's four hepplewhite chairs to an antique shop in bournemouth. * a forger: he forges lina's signature and cashes one of her cheques. * an embezzler: he embezzles captain melbeck's money to pay his gambling debts. luckily, melbeck doesn't prosecute. * an adulterer: during their marriage, he has affairs with many women and village girls, including lina's best friend, janet caldwell - he has a flat in bournemouth especially for that purpose - and ella, their parlour maid, by whom he has a son. * eventually, a murderer: he incites general mclaidlaw to do a trick involving chairs while he and lina are staying with the general for christmas. this is too much physical exercise for the general, and he dies suddenly. some years later, johnnie cheats a rich school friend of his, beaky thwaite, out of his money by traveling incognito to paris with him, going to a brothel and having him drink a whole beaker of brandy in one gulp so that he drops dead. however, lina's own death will be johnnie's first "real" murder. he goes to great lengths to conceive an undetectable murder. when isobel sedbusk, the author of detective stories, happens to spend the summer in their village, he associates with her and, on the pretext of discussing material for her new book, elicits a new method of murder from her: swallowing an alkali commonly used, but never suspected of being poisonous, and which leaves no trace in the human body for a post-mortem to find. at the very end of the novel, lina, who really seems to have gone mad, catches the flu. she has been waiting for her husband to try to murder her for months now. when he brings her a drink, she swallows it deliberately, knowing that it is a poisonous cocktail. johnny is going to get away with it ("people did die of influenza."), which is what lina, so much in love with her husband, hopes will happen. the novel covers a period of approximately ten years: johnnie aysgarth's courtship of, and marriage to, lina mclaidlaw, the disintegration of their marriage and her imminent death &mdash; although it is uncertain that she is really going to die. the whole story is told from lina aysgarth's point of view. we know everything she does and everything she thinks. on the other hand, we know practically nothing about the villain except for what lina sees and gathers, creating more suspense. ||| 1 ||| 0
the novel posits that space around the milky way is divided into concentric layers called zones, each being constrained by different laws of physics and each allowing for different degrees of biological and technological advancement. the innermost, the "unthinking depths", surrounds the galactic core and is incapable of supporting advanced life forms at all. the next layer, the "slow zone", is roughly equivalent to the real world in behavior and potential. further out, the zone named the "beyond" can support futuristic technologies such as ai and ftl travel. the outermost zone, the "transcend", contains most of the galactic halo and is populated by incomprehensibly vast and powerful posthuman entities. a human expedition investigates a five-billion-year-old data archive that offers the possibility of unimaginable riches for the ambitious young civilization of the straumli realm. the expedition's facility, called high lab, is gradually compromised by a dormant super-intelligent entity (actually encoded within the archive) later known as the blight. the blight rapidly learns how to infiltrate and control the computer systems of high lab, and even develops the ability to possess and control the living humans. the novel starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of this superintelligence through exponentially accelerating developmental stages, culminating in a transcendent, nigh-omnipotent power that is unfathomable to mere humans. shortly before its final "flowering", the changes in a single minute of the blight's life are said to exceed those of 10,000 years of human civilization. recognizing the danger of what they have awakened, the researchers at high lab attempt to flee in two ships. suspicious, the blight discovers that one of the ships contains a data storage device in its cargo manifest; assuming it contains information that could harm it, the blight destroys the ship. the second ship is allowed to escape, unharmed, as the blight assumes that it is no threat; but later realizes that it actually held a countermeasure, one of the few things in the universe that the blight fears. the ship lands on a distant planet with a medieval-level civilization of dog-like creatures dubbed "tines", who live in packs as group minds. the ship is revealed to be a sleeper ship, carrying most of high lab's children in "coldsleep boxes". the boxes are rapidly failing and the surviving adults begin unloading them, but are killed when one of two rival forces of tines seize the ship. the faction that initially contacts the humans, led by a tine known as steel, kills the adults and destroys many of the coldsleep boxes. they also capture a boy named jefri olsndot, whom steel intended on killing but eventually exploits in order to develop advanced technology (such as cannon and radio communication). jefri's older sister, johanna, is rescued by pilgrim and scriber, wandering tines who bring her to the rival faction, led by woodcarver. she is asked to help develop technology that could gain the upper hand in the impending war. a distress signal from the sleeper ship eventually reaches "relay", a major node in the galactic communications network. a benign transcendent entity (known as a "power") named "old one" contacts relay, seeking information about the blight and the humans who released it. old one constructs a seemingly human man, pham nuwen, to act as its agent. pham and ravna bergsndot – a human employee of relay's owners, the wealthy vrinimi organization – trace the sleeper ship's signal to the tines world. old one designs a vessel, the out of band ii, to reach the tines world and to investigate what the ship carried with it from the high lab. the blight attacks relay and old one. old one gives pham the information necessary to activate the blight countermeasure while dying (a process known as godshatter), and pham and ravna escape relay's destruction in the out of band ii. after arriving at the tines homeworld and allying with woodcarver to defeat steel, pham initiates the countermeasure, which extends the slow zone by thousands of light-years to enclose the blight. this ends the threat of the blight at the cost of wrecking thousands of uninvolved civilizations, causing trillions of deaths and potentially the extinction of several galactic races. the process also kills pham and strands the other humans on the tines world, now in the depths of the "slow zone" where rescue by an advanced civilization is impossible. ||| 2 ||| 5

both the novel and the tv series were based around the hensman brothers, robin (played in the tv series by craig mcfarlane), john (played by howard taylor) and harold (played by paul erangey (died 2004), who spend eight months living as outlaws in the forest of brendon chase. as in much british children's literature of the era, their parents are absent, and living in india, at the time part of the british empire, while in the tv series their mother has died and it is only their father who is abroad. they are cared for by their aunt ellen, a strict and somewhat cold spinster (played in the tv series by rosalie crutchley). at the end of the easter holidays, harold falls ill with the measles, so robin and john are unable to return to boarding school (described as "banchester" - the name is similar to winchester college, but it was inspired by rugby school where the author taught art). they decide to run away and fend for themselves, taking some food from their aunt's house, and also taking a rifle and ammunition so they can survive in the wild. despite continued attempts to catch them (usually involving police sergeant bunting, played in the tv series by michael robbins, and the reverend whiting, played in the series by christopher biggins) the three brothers - robin and john are later joined by harold when he recovers from his illness - prove sufficiently quick-witted and ingenious to evade capture for eight months, surviving on what they can kill (the acceptance of which is one of the most interesting aspects of both the book and the tv series today) and on supplies occasionally taken from other sources. in the book, though not the tv series, robin is known as "robin hood", john as "big john" and harold as "little john". a recurring subplot only in the tv series involves the brazenly cynical journalist monica hurling (played by liza goddard) from a fictional newspaper called "the london planet" (clearly based on the more populist papers of the 1920s, such as the daily express), who has written a number of stories stirring up public interest in the hensman boys, while the paper has offered a £50 reward to whoever can find them. she represents an amoral, sophisticated london, and the conflict between her and the conservative rural community where she is reporting has wider resonance in terms of social history. this character, however, does not appear in the book. in the later part of their time living in the wild, the boys - who by this time have long been wearing rabbit skins, their clothes having worn out - encounter an eccentric elderly charcoal burner called smokoe joe (played in the tv series by paul curran), who becomes a close friend. when smokoe joe is seriously injured, one of the boys saves his life by running for the doctor, thereby risking capture. after a christmas spent with smokoe joe in his hut, the boys are 'run to ground' when the doctor, who has kept their secret until that moment, arrives with their father who has returned, and the story ends there in the forest (christmas is not specifically referred to in the tv series). the bear that had escaped in the forest near the end of their adventure settles down to hibernate for the winter in the hollow oak tree where they had lived. ||| 0 ||| 6
the asteroid itself is an elongated prolate spheroid which appears to be virtually identical to juno, a large asteroid in the main belt. it has been hollowed out along its long axis, and subdivided into seven vast cylindrical chambers. it rotates to provide artificial gravity. the chambers are terraformed, the second and third containing abandoned cities which appear to be built by humans from earth's future. the humans who built the stone seem to come from approximately 1,200 years in the future. their libraries record that human civilization was nearly destroyed by "the death," a calamitous world war involving nuclear weapons, in 2005. events recorded in the libraries prior to the death (with the exception of the arrival of the stone itself) are almost identical to events occurring on earth in the explorers' present time. rising tensions between the u.s. and u.s.s.r., now exacerbated by both rumors of the information in the libraries and the general situation on the stone (the soviets and their allies have only limited access to the asteroid), suggest that not only is such a war imminent, but the appearance of the stone may actually make it worse than recorded. since the stone appears immediately prior to the recorded date of the death, and there is no record of its own appearance at the time, the scientists reason that the stone may come from an alternate future. patricia luisa vasquez, a brilliant but naïve young theoretical physicist from caltech, is hastily sent to the stone to determine if the death can be avoided on the current timeline, and to work out the mysteries of the corridor. a startling discovery is that the stone is larger on the inside than outside: the seventh chamber extends beyond the end of the asteroid and appears to go on forever. when patricia is mysteriously abducted by a strange looking human and an alien, an expedition is sent after her. they travel down the final chamber (called "the corridor" or "the way"), where they encounter humanity's descendants. the society of human descendents, called the hexamon, live in the axis city, a large structure on the axis of the way, one million kilometers from the stone, which they call thistledown. the hexamon is presided over by a governing body known as the nexus. it is loosely divided into two social groups, naderites and geshels, based on widely differing cultural and political viewpoints. the conservative naderites reject much of the high technology trappings of their society for a simpler life. they are in fact, followers of ralph nader, whom they call "the good man". nader, who was "martyred" during the death, came to be canonized by the followers who took his name. this was largely because he opposed the technology (particularly nuclear energy) that led to the catastrophic war. the futuristic geshels, on the other hand, embrace all manner of technological advances including human augmentation and artificial bodies. many radical geshels go so far as to choose non-human (or neomorphic) shapes for themselves, as opposed to moderate ones who choose a more human (or homorphic) appearance. ||| 5 ||| 5
when upper middle class businessman rex fortescue dies while having tea, the police are shocked. the diagnosis is death by taxine - a poison found as a mixture of cardiotoxic diterpenes in the leaves, but not the berries (darils), of the european yew tree. his wife was the main suspect in the murder, until she also was murdered, after drinking tea laced with cyanide. going on the only clue, a pocket full of rye found on the victim, miss marple begins investigating. marple realizes the murders are arranged according to the pattern of a childhood nursery rhyme, sing a song of sixpence. the next to be murdered is a maid named gladys with whom miss marple was acquainted. she knew gladys to be romantic and gullible. the other maid, ellen, was hanging out the washing when she found glady's body all mangled up in the clothes line with a peg on her nose. the younger fortescue son, lancelot, suddenly arrives from kenya with his new wife. the older son, percival, admits that his father was senile and ruining the business. miss marple discovers that the use of the rhyme in the crimes was to point the finger at an old dealing of the blackbird mine, in which old fortescue was suspected of having killed his partner, mackenzie, and swindled the mine from his partner's family. the mine is in kenya. thinking that one of the two mackenzie children is responsible, miss marple and inspector neele trace jennifer fortescue (percival's wife) to be the daughter of mackenzie - something that she does indeed admit, as well as taking responsibility for placing dead blackbirds near rex at various times to remind him of his past crimes. jennifer's involvement, however, turns out to be a red herring as the murderer is, in fact, lancelot. he had found out that the blackbird mine was valuable and wanted to inherit it, and so he met and romanced his scapegoat gladys. he talked her into joining the fortescue household and administering the poison in rex's morning marmalade, telling her that it was a truth drug and fabricating her a story about needing old fortescue to tell the truth in order to clear his name for something that he had been falsely accused of. then, he killed gladys so that she would not turn him in, and killed his stepmother so that the inheritance went to the children. ||| 6 ||| 6

after a brief overview of research into mescaline, huxley recounts that he was given 4/10 of a gram at 11:00 am one day in may 1953. huxley writes that he hoped to gain insight into extraordinary states of mind and expected to see brightly colored visionary landscapes. when he only sees lights and shapes, he puts this down to being a bad visualiser, however, he experiences a great change in his perception of the external world. by 12:30 pm, a vase of flowers becomes the "miracle, moment by moment, of naked existence". the experience, he asserts, is neither agreeable nor disagreeable, but simply "is". he likens it to meister eckhart’s ‘istigheit’ or ‘is-ness’, and plato’s ‘being’ but not separated from ‘becoming’. he feels he understands the hindu concept of satchitananda, as well as the zen koan that ‘the dharma body of the buddha is in the hedge’ and buddhist suchness. in this state, huxley explains he didn’t have an ‘i’, but instead a ‘not-i’. meaning and existence, pattern and colour become more significant than spatial relationships and time. duration is replaced by a perpetual present. reflecting on the experience afterwards, huxley finds himself in agreement with philosopher c.d. broad that to enable us to live, the brain and nervous system eliminate unessential information from the totality of the mind at large. in summary, huxley writes that the ability to think straight is not reduced while under the influence of mescaline, visual impressions are intensified, and the human experimenter will see no reason for action because the experience is so fascinating. temporarily leaving the chronological flow, he mentions that four or five hours into the experience he was taken to the world’s biggest drug store (wbds) where he was presented with books on art. in one book, the dress in botticelli’s judith provokes a reflection on drapery as a major artistic theme as it allows painters to include the abstract in representational art, to create mood, and also to represent the mystery of pure being. huxley feels that human affairs are somewhat irrelevant whilst on mescaline and attempts to shed light on this by reflecting on paintings featuring people. cézanne’s self portrait with a straw hat seems to him as incredibly pretentious, while vermeer’s human still lives (also, the le nain brothers and vuillard) are the nearest to reflecting this not-self state. for huxley, the reconciliation of these cleansed perceptions with humanity reflects the age old debate between active and contemplative life, known as the way of martha and the way of mary. as huxley believes that contemplation should also include action and charity, he concludes that the experience represents contemplation at its height, but not its fullness. correct behaviour and alertness are needed. nonetheless, huxley maintains that even quietistic contemplation has an ethical value, because it is concerned with negative virtues and acts to channel the transcendent into the world. after listening to mozart’s c- minor piano concerto, gesualdo’s madrigals and alban berg’s lyric suite, huxley heads into the garden. outside, the garden chairs take on such an immense intensity that he fears being overwhelmed; this gives him an insight into madness. he reflects that spiritual literature, including the works of jacob boehme, william law and the tibetan book of the dead, talk of these pains and terrors. huxley speculates that schizophrenia is the inability to escape from this reality into the world of common sense and thus help would be essential. after lunch and the drive to the wbds he returns home and to his ordinary state of mind. his final insight is taken from buddhist scripture: that within sameness there is difference, although that difference is not different from sameness. the book finishes with huxley’s final reflections on the meaning of his experience. firstly, the urge to transcend one’s self is universal through times and cultures (and was characterized by h.g. wells as the door in the wall). he reasons that better, healthier ‘doors’ are needed than alcohol and tobacco. mescaline has the advantage of not provoking violence in takers, but its effects last an inconveniently long time and some users can have negative reactions. ideally, self-transcendence would be found in religion, but huxley feels that it is unlikely that this will ever happen. christianity and mescaline seem well-suited for each other; the native american church for instance uses the drug as a sacrament, where its use combines religious feeling with decorum. huxley concludes that mescaline is not enlightenment or the beatific vision, but a 'gratuitous grace' (a term taken from st thomas aquinas’ summa theologica). it is not necessary but helpful, especially so for the intellectual, who can become the victim of words and symbols. although systematic reasoning is important, direct perception has intrinsic value too. finally, huxley maintains that the person who has this experience will be transformed for the better. ||| 4 ||| 5
the main protagonists are an american millionaire, theodore racksole, and his daughter nella (helen). while staying at the supremely exclusive grand babylon hotel, nella asks for a steak and bass beer for dinner, but the order is refused. to get her what she wants racksole buys the entire hotel, for £400,000 "and a guinea" (so the previous owner can say that he haggled with the multi-millionaire businessman). strange things are happening in the hotel. first, racksole notices the headwaiter, jules, winking at his daughter's friend, reginald dimmock, while they consume their expensive steak. he dismisses the headwaiter. the next day miss spencer, the pretty, efficient hotel clerk who has been employed there for years, disappears. it appears that she just took her things and left, no one knows when or where. and prince eugen, a prince regnant of posen, who was to come to the hotel and meet his youthful uncle prince aribert (he and the nephew are of the same age), never turns up. then the body of dimmock, who was an equerry to the princes, come ahead to prepare for their visit, is found. he was obviously poisoned. and soon after, dimmock's body disappears. the same evening the hotel is having a ball in the gold room, hosted by a mr and mrs sampson levi. there is a special secret window though which one can observe the room and the guests. racksole looks out of it and sees among the guests the dismissed headwaiter, jules. racksole runs out to confront him and throw him out, but can't find him. he comes back to the secret window to find jules, staring intensely into the ball room. racksole orders him out of the hotel for the second time. prince aribert, who met nella in paris while he was travelling incognito under the name of count steenbock, confides the whole story to her. he tells her that prince eugen never arrived, and no one knows where he is. he was last seen at ostend. his majesty the emperor sent a telegram to aribert, requesting the whereabouts of eugen. aribert, who does not know whether there might be a secret love affair, or an abduction, is facing a dilemma. at last he decides to go to berlin and state the facts to the emperor. nella promises him help and support in london. after the departure of aribert, an old lady signs into the hotel under the name of 'baroness zerlinski'. some chance remarks about hotel rooms convinced nella, who was substituting for the hotel clerk, that it was, in fact miss spenser in disguise. when she finds out that miss spenser suddenly checks out and departs for ostend, nella too goes to ostend, leaving a short message for her father as to her whereabouts. in ostend, nella follows miss spenser into a house, and tries to find out what's going on, threatening the latter with a revolver. miss spenser says that she was under orders of jules, the headwaiter, whose real name is tom jackson and who is, she claims, her husband. she says that jackson/jules quarrelled with dimmock and that he had some "money business" with prince eugen. she admits that the prince was a captive in that same house, and she looked after him. he was abducted to prevent him arriving to london, for it would have "upset the scheme". then miss spenser fakes a faint, and nella, who comes nearer to see if she can help her, is overpowered. nella loses consciousness. ||| 6 ||| 6
the novel takes place on a future earth (vidphones, telepaths, androids, ionocraft are normal) recently conquered by aliens from ganymede: limbless, worm-like creatures whose physical needs are attended to by a slave-race of specialist 'creeches'. mekkis is the leader of a ganymedean faction that opposed the war when his oracle (a creature capable of precognition) foresaw a 'coming darkness'. the apparent success of the invasion means he is now discredited. as a result, mekkis is saddled with the troublesome bale of tennessee, home to the last remaining core of resistance, the 'neeg-parts' led by black muslim leader percy x. unknown to all concerned, another resistance movement operates covertly under cover of the world psychiatric association. one of its agents, doctor paul rivers, is seeking to protect percy x by assassinating his former girlfriend, tv host joan hiashi who is collaborating with the ganymedeans to capture percy x. although joan hiashi switches sides after discovering that percy x is a trained telepath who can read her mind, percy x is still captured thanks to a tracking device planted on her by racist landowner gus swenesgard. mekkis offers percy x the chance to become the puppet ruler of tennessee. when the offer is violently declined, mekkis sends percy x and joan to the norwegian clinic of psychiatric genius rudolph balkani, who has had exceptional success turning resistors into enthusiastic collaborators via sensory deprivation therapy. dr. rivers manages to free joan and percy x, replacing them with androids. on discovering the ruse, rudolph balkani commits suicide. this along with a number of other suicides (encouraged by the world psychiatric association) lead the ganymedians to wrongly assume that balkani has helped the resistance infiltrate their collaborationist regime. judging their proxy rule of earth to be impractical, they decide to withdraw from the planet and destroy all life through a device that will block the sun's rays. meanwhile the neeg-parts have seized a cache of weapons developed by rudolph balkani during the war — machines that turn illusions thought up by their users into reality, and a 'hell-weapon' that was never used against the aliens, as it would destroy humanity as well. after most of his troops desert due to the psychological problems caused by the illusion machines, percy x is finally defeated by an army of robots created by gus swenesgard. dr. rivers is sent to kill percy x, both to prevent his capture and stop him activating the hell-weapon. mekkis has become obsessed with the theories of rudolph balkani. in order to get revenge on his enemies he forms a telepathic link with percy x that will enable the hell-weapon to destroy those ganymedians who are not on earth. after killing percy x, rivers is able to switch off the device before humanity is destroyed, but the ganymedians instinctively form a group mind in times of danger, and so become trapped in a permanent existential and experiential 'hell' within a dark void, unable to contact their creeches for help. the novel ends with the creeches returning to ganymede to start their own society, and the world psychiatric association supporting gus swenesgard as a useful puppet ruler until democracy is restored, though dr. rivers can't help wondering as to their true motives. it:l'ora dei grandi vermi ||| 2 ||| 5

bloody bones begins on saint patrick's day, shortly after the events of the previous anita blake novel, the lunatic cafe. like the previous novels, the novel opens with anita considering a possible job. this time, her manager, bert, is calculating a possible bid for a mass zombie raising in branson, missouri. bert explains that a law firm is soliciting bids to raise an entire graveyard in order to determine who owns a piece of land needed for a resort complex. the graves are unmarked and may contain corpses at least 100 years old, anita finds out later there are some that are much older than that, which will make the raising very difficult. in anita's opinion, she is the only person in the world who might be able to raise that many ancient unmarked graves without a human sacrifice. she agrees to take the job, and takes larry along to boost her powers, and as a training experience. (she and bert agree that although john burke also has the power to make a good second, his pride is such that it's best that he not even learn that anita took a job that he was not strong enough to take on his own). arriving in branson, anita meets raymond stirling, the lawyer in charge of the development project and his assistants, lionel bayard, ms harrison and beau, and learns that stirling is in a dispute with magnus and dorcas bouvier, two siblings who claim to own the land at issue and refuse to sell. if the corpses on the land confirm that it belongs to the bouviers, stirling's project will be unable to continue. after reviewing the site and making plans to explore the site further that evening, anita receives a call from dolph. dolph asks anita for advice on a crime scene back in st. louis and also asks her to assist the local police with a nearby crime scene. anita and larry drive to the scene and meet sergeant freemont, who appears to want to crack the case herself and resents their intrusion. anita inspects the murder victims—three teen-aged or younger boys cut apart with a blade. each of the boys' faces have been disfigured or removed, and freemont reveals that a teenaged boy and girl were murdered earlier, with similar wounds. anita warns freemont that in her opinion, the boys were cut apart by a sword wielded by something as fast and strong as a vampire, with enough mental power to hold two of the boys motionless while killing the third. larry is seriously shaken by viewing his first murder scene. anita and larry then go to the bouviers' restaurant, named "bloody bones," to investigate the land dispute and to get dinner. there, they meet magnus and dorrie, each of whom is part-fey. magnus is using glamour to host a date night. by touching the restaurant patrons, he makes them irresistibly attractive for one night, in return for drawing some power for himself. after trying unsuccessfully to seduce anita, magnus is coy about why the bouviers refuse to sell their land. magnus also admits to destroying several trees outside the restaurant while in a drunken rage, causing anita to consider him as a suspect for the recent killings. during dinner, dolph pages anita again, and asks her to assist on another possible local vampire crime. anita tells dolph that magnus is part-fey and a potential suspect, then anita and larry drive to the home of mr. and mrs. quinlan. there, they meet sheriff david st. john, his wife beth, deputy zack coltraine, mr. and mrs. quinlan, and their son jeff. jeff's older sister, ellie is lying in her bed, dead of a vampire bite. anita and larry eventually deduce that her death was probably voluntary, and learn that ellie's boyfriend andy recently disappeared. they guess that ellie's boyfriend has recently been raised as a vampire and turned her as well, but mr. quinlan refuses to believe them and demands that anita stake ellie to prevent her from rising. anita asks him to wait twenty-four hours to "cool off" and promises to stake ellie if her father demands it after that time. after instructing the quinlans to place the host at each doorway to prevent any vampires from reentering the home, anita explains that the vampire that turned ellie probably has a resting place nearby, and that they may catch it if they attempt a nighttime hunt. she heads out into the woods after it, together with larry, sheriff st. john, deputy coltraine, and two other police officers, wallace and granger. during the hunt, anita learns that wallace was a survivor of a vampire attack and shows him her own scars in an effort to put him at ease. during the hunt, anita and the others are ambushed by a pack of vampires. in the fight, anita kills two vampires, but granger is bitten, wallace's arm is broken, and xavier kills coltrain with a sword. while the hunters regroup, granger, now under vampire control, attempts to shoot larry, and anita is forced to kill him. the group then hears screams from the quinlan home, and st. john and anita run for the house, leaving larry and wallace to bring up the rear. when anita gets to the house, beth st. john is dead and jeff has been taken. (apparently, xavier was able to shapeshift and fit through a pet door). sheriff st. john kills a brown haired, female vampire. anita shoots at xavier, but he's too fast to hit. later, sergeant freemont arrives at the scene. she explains that after dolph told her that magnus was part fey, she went to arrest him. mangus used glamour to escape, and is now wanted for using magic on police officers during the course of his escape. fbi agents elwood and bradford arrive and speak to anita, who agrees to attempt to identify and contact the master of the city. anita calls jean-claude for information. jean-claude explains that he thinks he knows the vampire anita saw, and that it is an "exotic" vampire of a sort concealed from humans. among other things, it is a pedophile. jean-claude offers to come to branson to set up a meeting with the master of the city. with jeff quinlan in the hands of a monster, anita is forced to accept jean-claude's help. with no way to pursue the quinlan case, anita and larry return to the graveyard to "walk the graveyard" and attempt to sense the location and identities of the corpses in preparation for a later attempt to raise the dead. anita and larry experiment with combining powers, and are surprised at the degree to which they are able to magnify each other's abilities. however, their powers attract magnus, who appears and insists that they not raise the dead in that graveyard. stirling orders beau to shoot magnus for trespassing, but anita, realizing that stirling intended the evening as a trap for magnus, draws her own gun and buys magnus time to escape. anita and larry return to their hotel suite to find jean-claude and jason. jean-claude has flown in on his private jet, but it is now too late in the night to track down the master before dawn. jean-claude informs anita of xavier's name, then retires for the morning in her bed. jason visits with anita and larry, and challenges anita for dominance. anita wins, of course, and figures out that jean-claude has ordered jason to show his lycanthrope side in an effort to dissuade anita from marrying richard. jason acknowledges anita as dominant and goes to bed. later that morning, dorcas bouvier bursts into anita's hotel suite and demands to see magnus. after dorcas bursts into the bedroom and sees jean-claude and jason, she accepts that anita has not fallen victim to magnus's charms and explains why the bouviers refuse to sell their land. centuries ago their ancestor, a member of the fey, emigrated to colonial north america with a more powerful fey, rawhead and bloody bones trapped in a magic box. while rawhead was trapped, bouvier was able to create a potion from its blood and increase his own powers, but eventually, rawhead escaped and went on a murderous rampage. after a pitched battle, rawhead was sealed beneath the ground, and the bouvier family has remained in branson in order to prevent rawhead from escaping. anita convinces dorcas to take her to see the mound where rawhead is trapped, and they agree to go to the mound the following day. that evening, jean-claude prepares the group to meet seraphina, the master of branson. he explains that his visit raises issues of vampire politics. although vampires' interactions with one another are somewhat constrained by the laws of the vampire council, conflicts are still possible, and he has negotiated a delicate truce with seraphina. although the group must be prepared to fight, they may not strike the first blow. jean-claude and anita, accompanied by larry and jason, visit an apparently ruined and abandoned home, cloaked in magical shadow, and meet ivy, bruce, kissa, janos, pallas and bettina. the branson vampires engage in a calculated plan to force jean-claude's party to break the truce. without offering violence to his group, they threaten to torture two young women, then sexually harass jason. jean-claude is forced to challenge janos to a contest of power, which he begins to lose. ultimately, anita escapes the trap by baiting ivy into attacking her, allowing the group to use violence in their own defense. in the ensuing battle, larry kills bruce, and pallas and bettina are first shot, then torn apart. (however, because they are rotting vampires, they are almost impossible to kill.) anita is forced to give blood to save jean-claude's life. once jean-claude is stabilized, magnus appears and offers to convey the group to see seraphina under a flag of truce. seraphina toys with the group, but ultimately agrees that a murderous pedophile master vampire in her territory is a threat, and agrees to track down xavier. jean-claude is astounded that seraphina has somehow become powerful enough to assert mastery over vampires as formidable as janos. the group returns to the hotel to clean up. anita learns more about jean-claude's history and momentarily surrenders to her lust and kisses jean-claude, but stops when he draws blood (though he claims it was by accident). she stays with jean-claude as dawn comes and he "dies" for the day and is surprised at her growing sympathy towards him. anita then falls asleep herself and is visited in her dream by seraphina, who promises to reunite anita with her deceased mother if anita agrees to serve seraphina. anita wakes, and begins planning to kill seraphina. anita and larry meet up with dorcas bouvier, who takes them to the mound where bloody bones is imprisoned. when they arrive, they surprise magnus in the act of drinking bloody bones's blood, and dorcas realizes that magnus has been using bloody bones to boost his power for years. anita proposes that instead of raising the entire bouvier graveyard, she raise just enough zombies to confirm the bouviers' claim to the land and prevent stirling from digging up the graveyard and freeing bloody bones. that evening, accompanied by stirling, bayard, and harrison, anita and larry combine their powers to animate a few of the ancient corpses in the bouvier graveyard. just before anita completes the circle of blood needed to activate their power, she feels bloody bones stir and realizes that raising even a few zombies will free the monster. she stops, but ivy flies from the darkness and attacks. anita kills ivy in self-defense, but ivy's blood falls on the remaining span of the circle, closing the loop and activating her power. similar to anita's inadvertent human sacrifices in the laughing corpse, ivy's death supercharges anita's power, forcing her to animate every corpse in the graveyard. at that point, stirling and harrison draw guns, and stirling shoots bayard. apparently, seraphina and bloody bones promised stirling the land in return for bloody bones's freedom, and stirling had planned on killing anita once she raised the bouviers and freed the fey. anita orders the zombies to attack stirling and harrison and incapacitates them both. while she considers whether to kill them, janos arrives with a newly risen ellie, accompanied by bettina, pallas, kissa, xavier and their hostage, jeff quinlan. the vampires feed on and kill stirling and harrison, and inform anita that xavier has been serving seraphina since her arrival in branson. seraphina's vampires fly away, and anita goes to confront them and attempt rescue jeff, with the help of jean-claude, larry, and jason. bloody bones arrives and demands its freedom, but seraphina breaks her word to the fey and announces her intent to continue drinking its power forever. with her oath broken, larry and anita are able to break her spell over bloody bones, and it draws a sword and impales seraphina. bloody bones admits to anita that it has been able to manifest its form as a result of magnus's interference, and that it killed the teenagers for being bad children. realizing that bloody bones is mortal as long as it continues to share power with magnus, anita shoots the boggle, slowing it down long enough for xavier to kill it with a greatsword forged of cold iron. anita infers that xavier is a fey raised as a vampire, although xavier denies it. seraphina regains control, and decides that anita's blood might make an acceptable second choice for bloody bones's. in return for anita surrendering herself, seraphina agrees to let the others go. the next morning, anita wakes up next to seraphina in her coffin. she forces her way out and learns that the coffins of seraphina's vampires have been moved to the bloody bones bar and grill. (ellie does not have a coffin and is sleeping on the floor.) anita tries to escape, but magnus stops her. in the course of the fight, anita drips some of her blood on ellie and realizes that she can raise ellie as if she were a zombie. she does so and orders ellie to hold magnus while she makes her escape. with ellie clinging to his waist, magnus chases anita outside and is burned to death when ellie burns in the sunlight. anita contacts agent bradford and tells him where the vampires are resting. with anita, larry and the local authorities, bradford douses the bloody bones restaurant with gasoline and prepares to set it on fire. anita feels seraphina in her mind and forces the agents to handcuff her and lock her in a car so that seraphina cannot use her control over anita to interfere. as the fire consumes all of the vampires inside, including the now-dead jeff quinlan, seraphina forces anita to relive the death of her own mother, renewing her earlier trauma. in the epilogue, anita explains that dorcas, now free of the family curse, sold the bouvier land and left branson with her children, that the quinlans are suing animators, inc. because of anita's refusal to stake ellie when asked, and that anita herself is continuing her life in st. louis, notwithstanding the fresh emotional wounds. ||| 3 ||| 6
the novel is about peter's relationship with his younger brother, fudge, who always causes trouble for peter and his family. four-year-old fudge has gained a high vocabulary for his age owing to his curiosity. he also knows where babies come from and plans to be a bird when he grows up. according to his older brother, peter, he is the biggest pain ever invented, but is loved all the same. when peter's mother, anne, announces that she is pregnant for the third time, peter decides to run away from home. he worries that the baby will be like a carbon copy of fudge, but when anne gives birth to a beautiful baby girl they name tamara roxanne, who soon comes to be called "tootsie," he finds that his fears are unfounded. fudge, however, becomes jealous of all the attention she is getting and acts out. fudge's father (warren) decides to take a leave of absence from his advertising agency job to write a book. anne decides to return to university in order to pursue art history courses. peter's parents announce that they are moving to princeton, new jersey for a year in order for his parents to pursue their respective goals. peter unenthusiastic about the idea. furthermore, when he learns that fudge is enrolled at the same school as peter, he feels even worse. his best friend, jimmy fargo, however, tries to see the bright side: peter will be far away from his nemesis, sheila tubman, and jimmy promises that he will visit peter in princeton. princeton proves boring for peter until he meets a local boy named alex santo. discovering that they will be in the same class at school, they become friends. fudge makes a new friend of his own, a self-proclaimed bird expert named daniel manheim, who is jewish. at school, peter (who is 11 years old at the start of the book) is in sixth grade, while fudge is in kindergarten at the same elementary school. fudge resents his assigned teacher because she refers to him by his legal name, farley (the teacher disapproved of the nickname "fudge") and acts out by climbing to the top of the cabinetry in his classroom and refusing to budge; fudge is eventually moved to the other class, whose teacher accepts the nickname. over the course of the following year, peter and fudge each experience their own highs and lows: *fudge gets a myna bird he names uncle feather and then decides that he wants to be one when he grows up. *peter develops a crush on a local girl named joanne mcfadden. *jimmy comes to visit peter, but when he and alex meet and become fast friends, peter can't help feeling left out and resentful. *fudge receives a new bike for christmas, then tells peter a shocking secret—that he's always known santa isn't real. *fudge meets his favorite author, brian tumkin, and causes an awkward moment for peter at a school assembly. *after fudge plays a practical joke on peter, he refuses to bring him to a picnic he is having with alex. afterwards, fudge goes missing and peter thinks he is to blame, until he and daniel are found at a local bakery. at the end of their time in princeton, warren and anne talk about moving back to new york city. although peter has gotten accustomed to life there, he looks forward to going back to his "normal" life in the big city. the timeframe for this story is presumably 1978, as the book talks a lot about superman, which was the year the film debuted. peter says how he had seen it when he was still in new york city, but it had not yet played in princeton, so the friends he made there have not yet seen it. jimmy fargo claims to have already seen it twice; to which the second time he saw it was better. the story also mentions a coming of age event for peter. fudge pours ice down peter's shirt in the onscreen shot of superman kissing lois lane, and joanne sits with him and offers him napkins to dry off the cold water. jimmy and alex have not yet gotten into girl-boy relationships and tease him for it. fudge is also inspired by the film, believing it may be possible he was born on krypton and can become like superman. later (post-2003) reprints contain edits to the book, including a different christmas list for peter, references to record players replaced with cds, mp3 players and tapes, and making anne only allergic to tree nuts instead of all kinds (resulting in her unable to eat peanut butter in the original). fudge also mentions at one part that he likes to watch the muppet show, sesame street, and the electric company. this was edited so he says that he likes to watch nickelodeon and cartoon network. ||| 0 ||| 7
the plot of the king's justice spans a period of two months, from may 1124 to july 1124. the novel begins as king kelson haldane is making final preparations to launch a military campaign into the province of meara. although meara has been a part of gwynedd for over a century, a descendant of the ancient mearan rulers, caitrin quinnell, has gathered an army and risen against kelson to secure her place as queen of an independent and sovereign meara. additionally, caitrin has allied herself with edmund loris, the rabidly anti-deryni former-archbishop who has managed to escape from his imprisonment. kelson plans to set the haldane potential in his uncle, prince nigel haldane, before his departure, ensuring that his family's legacy of magic will not perish if kelson should not survive the war. however, kelson's plan deeply concerns the camberian council, who has long believed that multiple haldanes cannot wield the haldane magic simultaneously. further complicating matters is the ill-timed return of kelson's mother, queen jehana, whose anti-deryni sentiments cause considerable friction with her son. nonetheless, kelson carries through with his plan and sets the haldane potential in his uncle. the following day, kelson sends off the first half of his army, placing it under the command of bishop duncan mclain and earl dhugal macardry. as caitrin's forces prepare to do battle with kelson's armies, kelson receives the homage of king liam lajos ii furstán of torenth, who travels to rhemuth to acknowledge kelson as overlord of torenth. however, kelson decides to take both liam and his mother as honorable hostages, ensuring that torenth will make no aggressive move against gwynedd while kelson is occupied with the mearan situation. shortly thereafter, kelson and duke alaric morgan lead the second half of the royal army out from rhemuth to meet the mearan rebels. over the following weeks, the gwyneddan armies attempt to hunt down and destroy the mearan forces. in the north, loris and sicard macardry, caitrin's husband, continually elude duncan and dhugal. meanwhile, in the south, kelson and morgan chase after caitrin's son, prince ithel, whose own acts of rape and destruction have fueled kelson's anger. kelson eventually succeeds in capturing ithel, who is summarily executed for his crimes. on the same day, sicard and loris lure the northern gwyneddan army into a trap. realizing that loris is determined to capture him, duncan orders dhugal to flee the battle, hoping that the rest of the army will survive. dhugal manages to escape the battle, but duncan is defeated and captured. in rhemuth, jehana suffers a crisis of conscience when her own deryni powers enable her to discover a torenthi plot to assassinate nigel. jehana finally decides to warn nigel, and the assassination attempt is foiled. loris tortures duncan horribly, mutilating the deryni bishop in an attempt to force him to confess to charges of heresy. that night, dhugal succeeds in contacting kelson and informs the king of duncan's plight. as kelson's army marches through the night to rescue their comrades, loris prepares to burn duncan at the stake. however, duncan's execution is interrupted by the arrival of kelson's army. both kelson and morgan use their deryni powers to protect duncan, but it is ultimately dhugal who rescues the bishop. kelson corners sicard, but the pretender's husband refuses to surrender. unwilling to allow sicard's defiance to cost additional lives, kelson kills sicard with a single arrow. the remaining mearan soldiers throw down their arms, and the gwyneddan army is victorious. after several days of resting the army, kelson leads his host to laas, the mearan city to which caitrin has fled. kelson demands the pretender's surrender, and dhugal convinces his aunt to accede to the king's terms. after kelson's army takes possession of the city, loris and his aide are executed for their crimes, and kelson reluctantly orders the execution of the last member of caitrin's family, prince judhael. with the pretender's bloodline extinguished and her army defeated, kelson secures his authority over the land of meara. ||| 2 ||| 2

ishmael begins with a newspaper ad: "teacher seeks pupil. must have an earnest desire to save the world. apply in person." the nameless narrator and protagonist begins his story, telling how he first reacted to this ad with scorn because of the absurdity of "wanting to save the world," a notion he feels that once he foolishly embraced himself as an adolescent during the counterculture movement of the 1960s. however, he responds to the ad anyway and, upon arriving at the address, finds himself in a room with a gorilla. he notices a polysemous sign that reads "with man gone, will there be hope for gorilla?" to the narrator's surprise, he finds that the gorilla, calling himself ishmael, can communicate telepathically. at first baffled by this, the man learns the story of how the gorilla came to be here and soon accepts ishmael as his teacher, regularly returning to ishmael's office throughout the plot. the novel continues from this point mainly as a socratic dialogue between ishmael and his new student as they hash out what ishmael refers to as "how things came to be this way" for mankind. ishmael's life, which began in the african wilderness, was spent mostly in a zoo and a menagerie, and since had been spent in the gazebo of a man that extricated him from physical captivity. he tells his student that it was at the menagerie that he learned about human language and culture and began to think about things that he never would have pondered in the wild. subsequently, ishmael tells his student that the subject for this learning experience will be captivity, primarily the captivity of man under a distorted civilizational system. the narrator claims to ishmael that he has a vague notion of living in some sort of cultural captivity and being lied to in some way but he can not explain his feelings. before proceeding ishmael lays some ground definitions for his student. he defines: * takers as people often referred to as "civilized." particularly, the culture born in an agricultural revolution that began about 10,000 years ago in the near east; this is the culture of ishmael's pupil and, presumably, the reader. * leavers as people of all other cultures; often derogatorily referred to by takers as "primitive." * a story as an interrelation between the gods, man, and the earth, with a beginning, middle, and end. * to enact is to strive to make a story come true. * a culture is a people who are enacting a story. ishmael proceeds to tease from his pupil the premises of the story (i.e. myth) being enacted by the takers: that they are the pinnacle of evolution, that the world was made for man, and that man is here to conquer and rule the world. this rule is meant to bring about a paradise, as man increases his mastery of the world, however, he is always failing because he is flawed. man doesn't know how to live and never will because that knowledge is unobtainable. so, however hard he labors to save the world, he is just going to go on defiling and spoiling it. ishmael points out to his student that when the takers decided there is something fundamentally wrong with humans, they took as evidence only their own culture's history- "they were looking at a half of one-percent of the evidence taken from a single culture-- not a reasonable sample on which to base such a sweeping conclusion." ishmael says: "there's nothing fundamentally wrong with people. given a story to enact that puts them in accord with the world, they will live in accord with the world. but given a story to enact that puts them at odds with the world, as yours does, they will live at odds with the world. given a story to enact in which they are the lords of the world, they will act as the lords of the world. and, given a story to enact in which the world is a foe to be conquered, they will conquer it like a foe, and one day, inevitably, their foe will lie bleeding to death at their feet, as the world is now." ishmael goes on to help his student discover that, contrary to what the takers think, there are immutable laws that life is subject to and it is possible to discern them by studying the biological community. together, ishmael and his student identify one set of survival strategies which appear to be evolutionarily stable for all species (later dubbed the &#34;law of limited competition&#34;): in short, &#34;you may compete to the full extent of your capabilities, but you may not hunt down competitors or destroy their food or deny them access to food. in other words, you may compete but you may not wage war.&#34; all species inevitably follow this law, or as a consequence go extinct. the takers believe themselves to be exempt from this law and flout it at every point. ishmael explains how the takers rendered themselves above the laws governing life, using the story of the fall of man as an example. his version of why the fruit was forbidden to adam and eve in the garden of eden is: eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil provides the gods with the knowledge of who shall live and who shall die—knowledge which they need to rule the world. the fruit nourishes only the gods, though. if adam (&#34;man&#34;) were to eat from this tree, he might think that he gained the gods&#39; wisdom (without this actually happening) and consequently destroy the world and himself through his arrogance. &#34;and so they said to him, you may eat of every tree in the garden, save the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for on the day you eat of that tree, you will certainly die.&#34; ishmael makes the point that this story of the fall of man, which the takers have adopted as their own, was in fact developed by leavers to explain the origin of the takers. if it were of taker origin, the story would be of liberating ascent instead of a sinful fall. ishmael and his student go on to discuss how, for the ancient semitic herders among whom the tale originated, the story of cain killing abel symbolizes the leaver being killed off and their lands taken so that it could be put under cultivation. these ancient herders realized that the takers were acting as if they were gods themselves, with all the wisdom of what is good and evil and how to rule the world. and as a result the gods banished these people from the garden and they were brought from a life of bounty in the hands of the gods to one of being the accursed tillers of the soil. to begin discerning the leavers&#39; story, ishmael proposes to his student a hypothesis: the takers&#39; agricultural revolution was a revolution against the leavers&#39; story. the leavers take what they need from the world and leave the rest alone. living in this manner (&#34;in the hands of the gods&#34;), leavers thrive in times of abundance and dwindle in times of scarcity. the takers however, practicing their unique form of agriculture (dubbed by quinn, totalitarian agriculture) produce enormous food surpluses, which allows them to thwart the gods when they decide it&#39;s the takers&#39; time to go hungry. &#34;when you have more food than you need, then the gods have no power over you.&#34; thus, ishmael points out that the takers revolution was not just a technological change, but also serves a mythological function. "so we have a new pair of names for you: the takers are 'those who know good and evil' and the leavers are 'those who live in the hands of the gods'." ishmael goes on to point out that by living in the hands of the gods, man is subject to the conditions under which evolution takes place. australopithecus became homo by living in the hands of the gods—man became man by living in the hands of the gods-- &#34;by living the way the bushmen of africa live; by living the way the krenakarore of brazil live... not the way the chicagoans live, not the way londoners live.&#34; &#34;in the hands of the gods is where evolution happens.&#34; according to the takers&#39; story, creation came to an end with man. &#34;in order to make their story come true, the takers have to put an end to creation itself-- and they&#39;re doing a damn good job of it!&#34; ishmael brings together his synopsis on human culture by examining the story enacted by leaver cultures, which provides a model of how to live—an alternative story for the takers to enact. "the premise of the takers' story is 'the world belongs to man.' ...the premise of the leavers' story is 'man belongs to the world.'" "for three million years, man belonged to the world and because he belonged to the world, he grew and developed and became brighter and more dexterous until one day, he was so bright and so dexterous that we had to call him homo sapiens sapiens-- which means he was us." "the leavers' story is 'the gods made man for the world, the same way they made salmon and sparrows for the world. this seems to have worked well so far so we can take it easy and leave the running of the world to the gods'." ishmael emphasizes that &#34;not in any sense is the takers story &#39;chapter two&#39; of the story which was being enacted here during the first three million years of human life. the leavers&#39; story has its own &#39;chapter two&#39;.&#34; in evolution, observes ishmael&#39;s student, there seems to be a tendency toward complexity, and towards self-awareness and intelligence. perhaps the gods intend the world to be filled with intelligent, self-aware creatures and man&#39;s destiny following the leavers&#39; story is &#34;to be the first- without being the last&#34;; to learn and then to be a role-model and teacher for all those capable of becoming what he&#39;s become. ishmael finishes with a summary of what his student can do if he earnestly desires to save the world: "the story of genesis must be undone. first, cain must stop murdering abel. this is essential if you're to survive. the leavers are the endangered species most critical to the world - not because they're humans but because they alone can show the destroyers of the world that there is more than one right way to live. and then, of course, you must spit out the fruit of the forbidden tree. you must absolutely and forever relinquish the idea that you know who should live and who should die on this planet." "teach a hundred what i've taught you, and inspire each of them to teach a hundred." the student loses track of ishmael&#39;s whereabouts and in his search for the gorilla ultimately discovers that he was secretly falling ill and has since died of pneumonia. when the student goes back to ishmael&#39;s office, he finds the sign that he saw before (&#34;with man gone, will there be hope for gorilla?&#34;) has a backside. the back contains another message: &#34;with gorilla gone, will there be hope for man?&#34; ||| 2 ||| 5
randolph carter dreams three times of a majestic sunset city, but each time he is abruptly snatched away before he can see it up close. when he prays to the gods of dream to reveal the whereabouts of the phantasmal city, they do not answer, and his dreams of the city stop altogether. undaunted, carter resolves to go to kadath, where the gods live, to beseech them in person. however, no one has ever been to kadath and none even knows how to get there. in dream, randolph carter descends "the seventy steps to the cavern of flame" and speaks of his plan to the priests nasht and kaman-thah, whose temple borders the dreamlands. the priests warn carter of the great danger of his quest and suggest that the gods withdrew his vision of the city on purpose. carter enters the enchanted wood and meets the zoogs, a race of predatory and sentient rodents. for a novice, such an encounter could prove calamitous, but carter is an experienced dreamer and so is knowledgeable of their language and customs. when carter asks the zoogs about kadath, they don't know where it is; instead, they suggest that carter go the town of ulthar and find a wizened priest named atal who is learned in the ways of the gods. in the cat-laden city of ulthar, carter visits atal, who mentions a huge carving wrought on ngranek's hidden side that shows the features of the gods. carter realizes that if he can go to ngranek, examine the carving, and then find a place where mortals share those features and are thus related to the gods, he must be near kadath. carter goes to dylath-leen to secure passage to oriab. dylath-leen is infamous for the black galleys that frequent its harbors. these galleys are steered by oarsmen who are never seen and crewed by turbaned men that trade curious-looking rubies for slaves and gold. randolph carter's quest is interrupted when he is captured by the turbaned men and flown to the moon on one of their notorious black galleys. once there, he learns that the turbaned men are slaves to the terrifying moon-beasts. a procession of moon-beasts and their slaves escort carter across the moon to deliver him to the crawling chaos nyarlathotep (one of the other gods who rule space, in contrast to the great ones, the gods of earth). he is saved by the cats of ulthar, who slay his captors and return carter to earth's dreamlands in the port of dylath-leen. carter boards a ship sailing to baharna, a great seaport on the isle of oriab. on the way to oriab and while he travels across the island riding a zebra, carter hears dark whispers about the night-gaunts, though they are never properly described. carter makes a treacherous climb across ngranek and discovers the gigantic carving of the gods on its far side. he is surprised to see that the features match those of sailors who trade at the port of celephaïs, but before he can act on this knowledge, he is snatched away by the night-gaunts and left to die in the vale of pnath in the underworld. carter is rescued by friendly ghouls, amongst them richard pickman, a friend of carter's, the protagonist of another of lovecraft's stories, pickman's model and who is now also a ghoul, who agree to return him to the upper dreamlands. they make their way to the terrible city of the gugs to reach the tower of koth, wherein a winding stairway leads to the surface. finding the city asleep, carter and the ghouls attempt to sneak past the snoring gugs. the ghasts, the gugs' traditional enemies, begin an attack, but the group manages to ascend the stairway and open the great trapdoor to the enchanted wood. here carter comes upon a gathering of zoogs and finds that they plan to make war on the cats of ulthar. not wanting to see his friends harmed, carter warns the cats, enabling them to launch a surprise attack on the zoogs. after a brief skirmish, the zoogs are defeated. to abate further hostilities, the zoogs agree to a new treaty with the cats of ulthar. carter reaches the city of thran and buys passage on a galleon to celephaïs. while en route, carter asks the sailors about the men who trade in celephaïs&mdash;the ones he believes to be kin to the gods. he learns that they are from the cold, dark land of inquanok or inganok and that few people dare to travel there. even more ominous, there are no cats there. the plateau of leng with its inhuman treacheries is too near. in celephaïs, carter meets his old friend kuranes, the king of the city. kuranes is an old dreamer whom carter knew in the waking world, but when he died, he became a permanent resident of the dreamlands. longing for home, he has dreamed parts of his kingdom to resemble his native cornwall. kuranes knows the pitfalls of the dreamlands all too well and tries to dissuade carter from his dangerous quest. carter, however, will not be deterred. under the pretense of wishing to work in its quarries, carter boards a ship bound for inganok, a nation built of onyx. the trip to inganok takes three weeks, but as they draw near, carter spots a strange granite island. when he inquires about the mysterious isle, the captain explains that it is the nameless rock, and it is best to not speak of it. that night, carter hears strange howls from the nameless island. when carter arrives at inganok, he purchases a yak and heads northward, in the hope that past the onyx quarries he will find kadath. carter ascends a steep ridge beyond which nothing is visible but sky. at the summit, he looks out and gets a breathtaking view of a gargantuan quarry. carter sets off toward this quarry, but his yak, spooked, abandons him. carter is captured by a slant-eyed man, whom he has met before among the merchants of dylath-leen. the slant-eyed man summons a shantak-bird, which both ride over the plateau of leng, a vast tableland populated by pan-like beings. arriving at a monastery wherein dwells the dreaded high priest not to be described, carter now suspects that the slant-eyed man is yet another conspirator of the forces that seek to thwart his quest. the slant-eyed man leads carter through the monastery to a domed room with a circular well, which carter speculates leads to the vaults of zin in the underworld. herein, the high-priest, wearing a silken robe and a mask, is waiting. carter learns that the men of leng are the same beings that conceal their horns under turbans and trade in dylath-leen. he also learns that the night-gaunts do not serve nyarlathotep as is commonly supposed, but nodens, and that even earth's gods are afraid of them. it is never revealed to the reader who the high-priest in the silken mask is, but carter recoils from him in such horror that it is possible that he is nyarlathotep. (the text suggests that the high-priest is one of the moon-beasts.) when the slant-eyed man is momentarily distracted, carter pushes him into the well and escapes through the maze-like corridors. in pitch-black darkness, carter wanders through the monastery, fearing he is being pursued by the high priest not to be described. at last reaching the outside, carter realizes that he is in the ruins of ancient sarkomand, which lies near the coast. soon he encounters the ghouls that helped him earlier once more. the men of leng have taken them hostage on their ship, and they are to be taken to the nameless rock, revealed to be a moon-beast outpost. carter summons the rest of the ghouls from the underworld and they take control of the galley. after releasing their kin, they sail on to the nameless rock and fight a pitched battle against the moon-beasts. emerging victorious, and fearing the arrival of reinforcements, carter and the ghouls return to sarkomand. once there, carter obtains the services of a flock of night-gaunts to transport himself and the ghouls to the gods' castle on kadath. after an exhilarating flight, carter arrives at last at the abode of the gods, but finds it empty. finally a great procession arrives with much fanfare, led by a pharaoh-like man who explains to carter that the gods of earth have seen the city of carter's dreams and decided to make it their home, and have thus abandoned kadath. the gods walk no more in the ways of gods, and have become instead mere denizens of the jewelled city carter had glimpsed in his dreams. the pharaoh commands carter to find this city, so that the natural order might be restored. "it is not over unknown seas," he says, "but back over well-known years that your quest must go; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sun-drenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes. for know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth.... these things you saw, randolph carter, when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime, and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love." this mysterious man then reveals his identity&mdash;he is nyarlathotep, the crawling chaos, the emissary of the other gods who dwell in the blackness of space. nyarlathotep sends carter on a great inganok shantak-bird through space to the sunset city. unfortunately, carter realizes too late that the mocking nyarlathotep has tricked him, and that instead he is being taken to the court of azathoth at the center of the universe. at first believing he is doomed, carter suddenly remembers that he is in a dream and saves himself by leaping from the great bird. as he falls, his thoughts turn toward new england, and he wakes to find that he is at last in his marvelous sunset city; no longer in the dreamlands but in his own room in the waking world of boston, looking out upon its architectural graces, suffused in a splendid sunrise. the final lines of the story find nyarlathotep brooding over his defeat within the halls of kadath, mocking in anger the "mild gods of earth" whom he has snatched back from the sunset city. ||| 5 ||| 2
long before the events of the novel, the dark lord sauron forges the one ring to dominate the other rings of power and corrupt those who wear them: the leaders of men, elves and dwarves. he is vanquished in battle by an alliance of elves and men. isildur cuts the one ring from sauron's finger, claiming it as an heirloom for his line, and sauron loses his physical form. when isildur is later ambushed and killed by orcs, the ring is lost in the river anduin. over two thousand years later, the ring is found by a river-dwelling hobbit called déagol. his friend sméagol immediately falls under the ring's influence and strangles déagol to acquire it. sméagol is banished and hides under the misty mountains, where the ring extends his lifespan and transforms him over the course of hundreds of years into a twisted, corrupted creature called gollum. he loses the ring, his "precious", and, as recounted in the hobbit, bilbo baggins finds it. meanwhile, sauron reassumes physical form and takes back his old realm of mordor. gollum sets out in search of the ring, but is captured by sauron, who learns from him that "baggins" now has it. gollum is set loose, and sauron, who needs the ring to regain his full power, sends forth his powerful servants, the nazgûl, to seize it. the novel begins in the shire, where the hobbit frodo baggins inherits the ring from bilbo, his cousin and guardian. neither is aware of its origin, but gandalf the grey, a wizard and old friend of bilbo, suspects the ring's identity. when he becomes certain, he strongly advises frodo to take it away from the shire. frodo leaves, accompanied by his gardener and friend, samwise ("sam") gamgee, and two cousins, meriadoc ("merry") brandybuck and peregrin ("pippin") took. they nearly encounter the nazgûl while still in the shire, but shake off pursuit by cutting through the old forest, where they are aided by the enigmatic tom bombadil, who alone is unaffected by the ring's corrupting influence. after leaving the forest, they stop in the town of bree where they meet aragorn, isildur's heir. he persuades them to take him on as guide and protector. they flee from bree after narrowly escaping another assault, but the nazgûl follow and attack them on the hill of weathertop, wounding frodo with a morgul blade. aragorn leads the hobbits toward the elven refuge of rivendell, while frodo gradually succumbs to the wound. the ringwraiths nearly overtake frodo at the ford of bruinen, but flood waters summoned by elrond, master of rivendell, rise up and overwhelm them. frodo recovers in rivendell under the care of elrond. the council of elrond reveals much significant history about sauron and the ring, as well as the news that sauron has corrupted gandalf's fellow wizard, saruman. the council decides that they must destroy the ring, but that can only be done by returning it to the flames of mount doom in mordor, where it was forged. frodo volunteers to take on this daunting task, and a "fellowship of the ring" is formed to aid him: sam, merry, pippin, aragorn, gandalf, gimli the dwarf, legolas the elf, and the man boromir, son of the ruling steward denethor of the realm of gondor. after a failed attempt to cross the misty mountains via the pass below caradhras, the company are forced to try a more perilous path through the mines of moria, where they are attacked by the watcher in the water before the gate. once inside, they discover the fate of balin and his company of dwarves, and realize their own danger. after repulsing an attack, they are pursued by orcs and an ancient, powerful balrog. gandalf confronts the balrog, but in their struggle, both fall into a deep chasm. the others escape and take refuge in the elven forest of lothlórien, where they are counselled by galadriel and celeborn. with boats and gifts from galadriel, the company travel down the river anduin to the hill of amon hen. boromir succumbs to the lure of the ring and attempts to take it from frodo. frodo escapes and determines to continue the quest alone, though sam guesses his intent and comes along. meanwhile, orcs sent by saruman and sauron kill boromir and kidnap merry and pippin. after agonizing over which pair of hobbits to follow, aragorn, gimli and legolas pursue the orcs bearing merry and pippin to saruman. in the kingdom of rohan, the orcs are slain by a company of the rohirrim. merry and pippin escape into fangorn forest, where they are befriended by treebeard, the oldest of the tree-like ents. aragorn, gimli and legolas track the hobbits to fangorn, and encounter gandalf, resurrected as the significantly more powerful "gandalf the white" after his mutually fatal duel with the balrog. gandalf assures them that merry and pippin are safe. they ride to edoras, the capital of rohan, where they free théoden, king of rohan, from the influence of saruman's henchman gríma wormtongue. théoden musters his fighting strength and rides to the ancient fortress of helm's deep, but en route gandalf leaves to seek help from treebeard. meanwhile, the ents, roused from their customarily peaceful ways by merry and pippin, attack isengard, saruman's stronghold, and trap the wizard in the tower of orthanc. gandalf convinces treebeard to send an army of huorns to théoden's aid. gandalf and rohirrim reinforcements arrive just in time to defeat and scatter saruman's army. the huorns dispose of the fleeing orcs. gandalf then parleys with saruman at orthanc. when saruman rejects his offer of redemption, gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers. pippin looks into a palantír, a seeing-stone that saruman had used to communicate with sauron and through which he was enslaved. gandalf rides for minas tirith, chief city of gondor, taking pippin with him. frodo and sam capture gollum, who had been following them from moria, and force him to guide them to mordor. finding mordor's black gate too well guarded to attempt, they travel instead to a secret passage gollum knows. torn between his loyalty to frodo and his desire for the ring, gollum eventually betrays frodo by leading him to the great spider shelob in the tunnels of cirith ungol. frodo is felled by shelob's bite, but sam fights her off. sam takes the ring and leaves frodo, believing him to be dead. when orcs find frodo, sam overhears them say that frodo is only unconscious, and chases after them. sauron unleashes a heavy assault upon gondor. gandalf arrives at minas tirith to alert denethor of the impending attack. the city is besieged, and denethor, driven to despair by sauron through the use of another palantír, gives up hope and commits suicide, nearly taking his remaining son faramir with him. with time running out, aragorn has no choice but to take the paths of the dead, accompanied by legolas and gimli. there aragorn raises an undead army of oath-breakers bound by an ancient curse. the ghostly army help them to defeat the corsairs of umbar invading southern gondor. the forces of gondor and rohan break the siege of minas tirith. sam rescues frodo from the tower of cirith ungol, and they set out across mordor. meanwhile, in order to distract sauron from his true danger, aragorn leads the armies of gondor and rohan in a march on the black gate of mordor. his vastly outnumbered troops fight desperately against sauron's armies. at the edge of the cracks of doom, frodo is unable to resist the ring any longer, and claims it for himself. gollum suddenly reappears, struggles with frodo and bites off his finger, ring and all. celebrating wildly, gollum falls into the fire, taking the ring with him. with the destruction of the one ring, sauron perishes, along with the nazgûl, and his armies are thrown into such disarray that aragorn's forces emerge victorious. with the end of the war of the ring, aragorn is crowned elessar, king of arnor and gondor, and marries his long-time love, arwen, daughter of elrond. saruman escapes from isengard and enslaves the shire. the four hobbits, upon returning home, raise a rebellion and overthrow him. gríma turns on saruman and kills him, and is slain in turn by hobbit archers. the war of the ring thus comes to its true end on frodo's very doorstep. merry and pippin are acclaimed heroes, while sam marries rosie cotton and uses his gifts from galadriel to help heal the shire. frodo, however, remains wounded in body and spirit after having borne the weight of the one ring so long. several years later, accompanied by bilbo and gandalf, he sails from the grey havens west over the sea to the undying lands to find peace. after rosie's death, sam gives his daughter the red book of westmarch, containing the account of bilbo's adventures and the war of the ring as witnessed by the hobbits. sam is then said to have crossed west over the sea himself, the last of the ring-bearers. ||| 2 ||| 2
this book tells the tale of jedi master nejaa halcyon & jedi padawan anakin skywalker trying to rescue an important republic communications hub from the separatist forces, located on the barren planet of praesitlyn. halcyon, having previously failed an important mission, is sent as a trial in order for him to regain the jedi council's trust. as they had grown close during their time in the jedi temple, halcyon chose anakin as his second in command against the wishes of the council, making the mission as much a trial for anakin as well. even before reaching praesitlyn, halcyon confesses to anakin of his violation of the jedi code, that he had a wife and a son. in turn, anakin relates about his own forbidden marriage to padmé amidala with both jedi promising not to reveal their digressions to anyone. anakin & nejaa halcyon lead the republic reserve forces to reinforce praesitlyn and to recover the hostages within the intergalactic communications center from c.i.s. occupation. the opposing c.i.s. forces are commanded by muun admiral pors tonith of the intergalactic banking clan, under command himself from asajj ventress and sith lord count dooku. at this time the praesitlyn defence forces have been overcome with trooper odie subu and lieutenant erk h'arman, the only survivors. the only reason praesitlyn has not been completely overrun by the c.i.s. is because of intervention by rogue former republic officer, captain slayke and his troops, the badly outnumbered sons and daughters of freedom. halcycon and anakin arrive just in time to relieve slayke with all available troops though the situation is still perilous. anakin is for the first time put in a commanding position and while acquitting himself well, clearly shows frustration and impatience to be fighting. in addition to anakin's issues, the book also deals with attitudes towards clones, and their degree of humanity. we see a general stereotyping that clones are subdegree humans, with their personalities and abilities often not being trusted as much as those of other beings. this can be seen in actions of reconnaissance where it is clear if clone commando ct-19/39 had not been disregarded, he would have been able to relay important information that would have saved hundreds of lives. instead only sergeant omin l'loxx was relied upon, resulting in disaster. with such a disastrous failure, anakin decides upon a desperate measure by which he and a small attack group of two troop transports fly directly to within the icc to rescue the hostages. anakin in his element destroys almost all droids in his path, leaving the troops behind him in awe and with nothing to shoot at. reaching the hostages, anakin is shocked as a woman reminds him so much of his mother. as she is killed we see anakin become an avenger, treading perilously close to the dark side of the force. jedi master nejaa halcyon, as well as grand master yoda and indeed darth sidious feel the disturbances in the force at this, though only one yet understands their meaning. anakin's rampage only ends before murdering pors tonith, as he hears qui-gon jinn's voice reaching him through the force, telling him to use the force for good not destruction. although anakin initially brings himself out of his rage, we can tell it is only suppressed to be brought out later once again. though their objectives had been achieved, as well as pors tonith having been captured by anakin's actions, the separatist's relief fleet arrives under a cloaking device. in the battle anakin is again in his element, with master halcyon becoming more his wingmate than commander. anakin, although being called back, seemingly decides to sacrifice himself in order to destroy the enemy flagship. to halcyon's horror, anakin disappears in the blast of the separatist's relief fleet's explosion. later however, in the midst of mourning anakin and celebrating victory, anakin's craft returns much to everyone's surprise. anakin later explains his seeming resurrection, saying how he had installed a hyperdrive engine in his starfighter, enabling him to escape from the blast, with his split-second timing, stemming from his immense force-sensitivity. on his return to coruscant, the jedi council, overbowed with exceptional reports of anakin's performance, finally agree to grant him knighthood in the order. ||| 5 ||| 5
the carnelian cube of the title is a small red "dream stone" confiscated by archaeologist arthur cleveland finch from tiridat ariminian, one of the workers on the dig he is supervising in cappadocia. it bears an inscription in etruscan that appears to identify its original possessor as apollonius of tyana, and supposedly allows the bearer to attain the world of his dreams. finch, frustrated with the irrationality of his existence as an archaeologist, yearns for a more rational world in which he could realize his true dream of being a poet. sleeping with the stone beneath his pillow he finds himself cast into a parallel world. it and later worlds visited by finch tend to place him in or near his native louisville, kentucky rather than the middle eastern locale he starts out from, but kentuckys that, while appearing to share much of the "real" world's history, have developed in radically alternate directions due to differences in their worlds' psychological or physical properties. finch's new home sets the pattern; it is entirely too rational, with its denizens acting solely from self-interest in a society organized on a strict patron-client basis. the regimentation extends to naming conventions: people's names are ordered surname first, given name second, and occupation last. finch initially finds himself classed as "finch arthur poet" — and is, indeed, a poet. poets are, however, a low-classified occupation, with few perks, certainly as compared to the local patron, sullivan michael politician. finch's attempts at social climbing, while initially successful, also bring him enemies, eventually making his new world too hot for him. unfortunately, the stone had not made the trip with him, and finch's only means of escaping this new and not entirely congenial existence is to purloin its counterpart from the local version of tiridat. with the rational world's counterpart stone, finch dreams himself into a second parallel world, this one exemplifying the individualism he has missed in the rational world. but he finds the individualist world one of rampant vanity and violence, in which megalomaniacal bully-boys like colonel richard fitzhugh lee uneasily dominate a population of extreme egocentrics defensive of their "originality" and touchy about being told what to do. it is also a more fantastic place, in which claims of esp or the ability to raise spirits tend to be real. hiring a medium-provided spirit to do the dirty work, finch again obtains his current world's counterpart of the carnelian cube and makes his escape, this time hoping to regain his original existence as an archaeologist reconstructing the past. finch awakens in yet another parallel world, only to find the stone has once again over-literalised his dream; his third world is one in which astrology-guided archaeologists really do reconstruct the past, drafting and magically conditioning vast numbers of people to reenact past events. he finds himself project head of a recreation of the assyrian siege of samaria, and quickly discovers the reenactment no mere fantasy; the brainwashed participants actually fight, kill and die in the furtherance of scientific knowledge. caught up in the chaos, finch faces execution at the order of the reenactor portraying usurping assyrian king sargon. "sargon" turns out to be yet another version of tiridat, who, like the others, is the possessor of this world's carnelian cube. begging the cube from the "king" as a last request, finch determines to escape once again by dreaming himself into a truly ideal world. on this note the novel ends, with neither the protagonist's possible execution or projected escape recounted, leaving the plot open-ended and providing an obvious opportunity for a sequel. however, no such sequel ever appeared. ||| 2 ||| 5
in an upper class salon on cater street several women discuss, in oblique terms, the death of a local girl. even though susannah has recently been out of town and is unaware of the murder, it is bad form for proper women to talk about such matters and so they are careful not to say anything too direct about the way the daughter of a friend was garroted and cut open. finally, tiring of the game, charlotte comes out and tells her aunt what she has heard about the murder. although the victim was of the upper class she quickly gains a reputation as having been a bad seed. a second death occurs, this time a servant. again the idea that these women did something to deserve this end is easier to accept than the knowledge that it could happen to anyone else. only when the third murder happens to a member of the ellison household do they believe that these crimes might not be a simple case of robbery or jealousy. a young police inspector, thomas pitt, has been investigating these crimes and soon arrives to question the ellison household. pitt is the educated son of a gamekeeper and cook. his education and manners let him wander in upper-class circles, while his dress and impolite tactics keep them from becoming entirely comfortable with him. although pitt aspires to higher social standing, he requests that he be treated as a middle class working man. none of this endears the inspector to caroline ellison, the lady of the house and mother of sarah, emily and charlotte ellison. pitt uses pointed questions and little tact to find the information he needs. he often knows the answers to questions before he speaks and so puts everyone off-guard as they attempt to keep their secrets hidden. before long, every female suspects every male of being the hangman, much to the detriment of long standing marriages and relationships. as the investigation into who is killing the young women progresses, thomas falls in love with the unconventional charlotte. outwardly, charlotte is a model of victorian society, but she does not wish to become one of the mindless women she sees everyday. instead, she reads newspapers that are smuggled out of her father's sight and speaks her mind on all manner of subjects. she finds out more about the world beyond her door when she meets thomas and finds that he will engage her in useful and interesting discussions. anne perry wrote the cater street hangman as a single, stand alone, novel. she had not intended for it to become a series and so there are elements in this book which do not blend smoothly into the series. ||| 1 ||| 0
on his way to queen iris's masquerade ball in honor of trent's accession to the throne one year before, bink is attacked by a floating sword, which he deflects using his talent of protection against magical harm. at the ball, he is attacked again by an unseen enemy. finally, bink confides in king trent, who decides to remove bink from harm's way by sending him out on a mission to find the source of magic of xanth. to help him, king trent sends chester the centaur and the soldier crombie. crombie is turned into a griffin by king trent, whose magical talent is the ability to transform living things. first, the party heads to the good magician humfrey's castle, to ask his advice about their quest. when they tell him they are attempting to discover xanth's source of magic, humfrey decides he wants to come as well. they come across beauregard the demon who tells them they should abandon their quest, as it could result in the destruction of all magic in xanth. at this time they also find grundy the golem, whose talent is understanding any language. this is particularly useful because crombie in griffin form can only speak in squawks, which grundy is able to translate. on their quest, they meet many obstacles, including a siren, a gorgon whose face turns men to stone, madness itself, a dragon, tangle trees, and an ogre. bink narrowly escapes all enemies through a series of seemingly circumstantial events, due to his talent. eventually they find the source of magic - a demon named x(a/n)th imprisoned deep below the surface. bink is faced with a moral dilemma, to let it be free and destroy all magic in xanth and act against the brain coral, or to keep it against its will. he eventually lets the magic go by freeing the demon, but is convinced by cherie centaur to go back and look for the demon again, hoping to convince it to stay. after some negotiation, the demon agrees under the condition that the magic shield which separated xanth from mundania will protect him from foolish intruders. upon bink's return home, he discovers his son dor possesses a magician calibre talent - he can talk to inanimate objects. pl:źródła magii ||| 2 ||| 2
the book follows the evolution of mankind as it shapes surviving purgatorius into tree dwellers, remoulds a group that drifts from africa to a (then much closer) new world on a raft formed out of debris, and confronting others with a terrible dead end as ice clamps down on antarctica. the stream of dna runs on elsewhere, where ape-like creatures in north africa are forced out of their diminishing forests to come across grasslands where their distant descendants will later run joyously. at one point, hominids become sapient, and go on to develop technology, including an evolving universal constructor machine that goes to mars and multiplies, and in an act of global ecophagy consumes mars by converting the planet into a mass of machinery that leaves the solar system in search of new planets to assimilate. human extinction (or the extinction of human culture) also occurs in the book, as well as the end of planet earth and the rebirth of life on another planet. (the extinction-level event that causes the human extinction is, indirectly, an eruption of the rabaul caldera, coupled with various actions of humans themselves, some of which are only vaguely referred to, but implied to be a form of genetic engineering which removed the ability to reproduce with non-engineered humans.) also to be found in evolution are ponderous romans, sapient dinosaurs, the last of the wild neanderthals, a primate who witnesses the extinction of the dinosaurs, symbiotic primate-tree relationships, mole people, and primates who live on a mars-like earth. in the book's epilogue, it is implied that the replicator machines sent by humans to mars have developed sentience and high technology, unknowingly advancing the late mankind's legacy in the universe. ||| 2 ||| 5

the novel centers on three character groups: that of hockenberry (a resurrected twentieth-century homeric scholar whose duty is to compare the events of the iliad to the reenacted events of the trojan war), greek and trojan warriors, and greek gods from the iliad; daeman, harman, ada, and other humans of an earth thousands of years after the twentieth century; and the "moravec" robots (named for scientist and futurist hans moravec) mahnmut the europan and orphu of io, also thousands of years in the future, but originating in the jovian system. the novel is written in first-person, present-tense when centered on hockenberry's character, but features third-person, past-tense narrative in all other instances. much like simmons's hyperion, where the actual events serve as a frame, the three groups of characters' stories are told over the course of the novel and begin to converge as the climax nears. ||| 5 ||| 5

in this novel, we find jack back in his village, at the start of the new year. the bard calls for a "need fire", a ceremony that must be performed by a young girl, to reverse the bad omens of the past year and to help the sun come back out on this day of the year where night is the longest. lucy, jack's younger sister, is to be the girl, but she breaks the bard's rules and spoils the ritual by wearing a silver necklace. pega, a terribly ugly slave, inferior to everyone in the village, is chosen to hold the candle and finish the ceremony. the sun did come out, but there was still danger to the village. jack is kicked out of his house after freeing pega, with the silver he received from past adventures (see the sea of trolls) but hid from his angry father. he now lives with the bard. jack continues his training as a bard; however, just when his bardic skills are growing, his mother calls him back home. lucy, his beautiful, otherwordly little sister, has become uncontrollable. because her father always told her that she is a lost princess, lucy is acting like one and is treating her parents like peasants. father, under horrible guilt and mental anguish, admits that lucy isn't his real daughter at all.. his real daughter, hazel, was stolen by hobgoblins while father was in the forest, and replaced by lucy. lucy was "the most beautiful infant he [father] had ever seen," and he fell under the sin of "temptation" and brought lucy home. the bard suggests that even if the uncontrollable lucy isn't jack's real sister, they should cure her. to cure lucy, the bard, jack, pega, and a monk named brother aiden take the girl to father swein's (st. fillians) monastery, near the fortress of din guardi. when they arrive, jack is horrified by the brutal methods of exorcism at the monastery and he tries to rescue lucy from the monks. using his magical powers, he accidentally causes an earthquake, in the course of which lucy is kidnapped by the lady of the lake and the holy well at st. fillians becomes dry. yffi, the half-monster king of din guardi, imprisons jack's father and orders jack to go underground and call upon the lady of the lake to restore water to the well. a slave named brutus, whom jack believes is good at nothing but grovelling, accompanies jack and pega as they travel through the tunnels. they travel for several days, and come across a small tunnel that has no air current. forgetting the bard's warning of these tunnels, they go in, and encounter a horrific monster called a knucker. the knucker takes on the shape of whatever one's greatest fear is--for jack, the knucker appeared to be a dragon, and to pega, it appeared to be a gigantic bedbug. jack's magic destroyed it, but brutus is separated from them. jack and pega awaken on the outskirts of elfland, an enchanted, perfect place with loving, trusting animals, delicious fruits from lush trees, and teeming life all around. the two travelers continue around, looking for brutus, and find that each morning after they wake, food appears nearby. as they journey on, they come across jack's old friend, thorgil (met in the sea of trolls), a norse shield maiden who was encased in moss by the forest lord, after killing a fawn that trusted her. jack and pega free her and learn her story. thorgil had been raiding with her friends when they came across a beach. on the beach was an entrance to the elfland, and thorgil was chosen to explore the tunnel. the nephew of their king was also along; he was a spoiled raider who demanded the highest honors, an undeserved title, and the best plunder. he led the way, heavily armed, and found a tunnel with no air current. thorgil warned him not to go in, but he ignored her and ventured in. thorgil heard him screaming and saw a knucker kill heinrich "the heinous", the spoiled raider. at this point, the earthquake that jack caused struck, and the knucker was crushed while thorgil was swept into elfland. she wandered around, and a fawn lay down in front of her. oblivious to the rules of the land, thorgil swiftly slit its throat. however, she was incapable of snapping any branches off trees for a fire, and when the forest started to attack her, she fled, terrified. after she exhausted herself, she was slowly buried under the moss. it wasn't able to completely cover her, since her rune of protection saved her, but she was starving to death when jack and pega arrived and saved her. at this point, the trio go to sleep, but after a fight between pega and thorgil, thorgil and jack sleep close to each other while pega goes off alone. jack wakes up in the night and finds that pega is surrounded by ugly creatures. he quietly wakes thorgil up, and the two go to see what's going on. the creatures reveal that they are hobgoblins and were supplying the group, and that their king, bugaboo, is in love with pega. they take the trio underground with them, where they hold them captive. however, some of the hobgoblins, led by nemesis, bugaboo's closest friend, release the captives so that pega doesn't stop bugaboo from ruling well. the hobgoblins send the three to the heart of elfland, where the elves hold them captive. there, they meet father severus, a monk who had been captured along with jack by thorgil several years before. they also meet the abbot of the monastery of st. fillians, and one of his victims. during the feast jack sees lucy who when he tries to remind her about his parents, she instantly responds that they were crude and ugly and that she is really the elf queen's daughter. sadly, jack realizes that there is nothing that he can do. he accepts the fact lucy is an elf that when and if she dies, she'll go to neither heaven or hell. brutus is also encountered, as a servant to the elves. the elves soon choose father severus as a sacrifice to what severus calls satan. while the elves lead the captives to be sacrificed, brutus passes a single inflammatory mushroom and firemaking tools to jack. the elves begin cruel games while they wait for satan to appear. he appears at the zenith of the moon in the sky, and begins to pick a sacrifice - thorgil runs forward and punches him when he considers her, distracting him, but setting her hand on fire. as she frantically begins attempting to put it out, the victim of the abbot runs forward and throws the abbot to satan. satan, enraged, consumes the abbot and slays the victim as well. at this point, jack lights a the mushroom, and the flames, which are the only real things in elfland, dispel the elves' illusions and reveal who they truly are. satan seizes an elf instead of the captives, and withdraws into the earth, while the elves attempt to recreate their illusions and hide their horribly aged forms.then the hobgoblins arrive with king bugaboo and rescue them. the captives escape to the surface, taking ethne, the bard's daughter with the elf queen, who later strives to earn a soul with the christians. but when they are in safety they find that thorgil's right hand has been covered with silver, paralyzing it. at first she is inconsolable, but when jack compares her brave deed to the norse god tyr who sacrificed his right hand to imprison fenris, the great wolf. he promises he will sing a saga about it, pulling her out of her moping. brutus has already gone, bringing water with him, to conclude the quest. however, the captives are captured by yffi; he is half-kelpie, and loves the taste of hobgoblin. while he is distracted with them, jack escapes with thorgil and pega, to get aid from below the fortress. they come across creatures called yarthkins, which they free by sacrificing jack's staff; breaking the bound of unlife. as the creatures swarm into the castle and break its defenses, first pega displays her affection for jack by kissing him, then jack kisses thorgil. the hobgoblins, jack, thorgil, and pega then escape as the forest lord begins to rip the fortress apart. they go to the village, where brutus, a descendant of lancelot, has taken charge. jack notes thorgil's beauty as they retrieve jack's father and begin to return home. thorgil, who was abandoned by the northmen, who thought she was dead, accompanies them. the hobgoblins then leave, as pega rejects bugaboo, and the book concludes with jack relaxing alongside thorgil, his father, the bard and pega. ||| 2 ||| 2
bobby begins on the territory of veelox, with gunny, where they land in the dark room outside the veelox flume. bobby and gunny encounter saint dane and believe they have him cornered, however, four realistic holograms of the villain suddenly appear around him, allowing the actual saint dane to escape (to a territory called eelong) amidst the confusion. bobby and gunny decide to split. gunny will immediately go to eelong and report back later with news while bobby stays on veelox because saint dane had mentioned that it is on the verge of destruction. bobby hates the darkness and is worried if the inhabitants of veelox are floating giants after meeting aja killian, the local traveler, in the form of a massive holographic face. bobby doesn't know if the huge hologram is life-sized. he meets up with a very ordinary, humanoid aja in a city much like those on second earth, called rubic city. the only differences are that it is deserted, and there is a huge structure called the lifelight pyramid looming over the town. aja explains that lifelight is a virtual reality world—a computer that gives people's desires the appearance of being real. almost everyone on veelox is in it, living out their own perfect virtual lives. she takes bobby through it, and he is amazed at the vedders, who are the "physical" caretakers of the bodies, and the phaders, computer geniuses running the place. she is one of the latter. bobby experiences his own fantasy "jump";he meets his family, plays with his dog, marley, and plays a basketball game where he and his team simply cannot lose. aja then explains that, because lifelight is so perfect, hardly anyone leaves. no food is being made. the territory is dying. however, she has a way to stop lifelight....a reality bug that preys on your fears to make it all less-than-perfect. she then takes bobby to where he left off in his fantasy, but uses her virus to make it different. his opponents are taller, his coach has a heart attack, and he is injured. while in the locker room aja tells him is this is how to save the territory. however, a saint dane hologram appears and tells them that the bug is working "far better than you could imagine". saint dane is right. the reality bug has become far too realistic; its use of fears to dilute the jumps has a placebo effect on people, in that if they die in their fantasy, the death is real. only one man can stop the rapidly evolving virus; dr. zetlin, who invented lifelight and the only one to know of the origin code, the key to purging the bug from the processing code. zetlin is in lifelight. thankfully, he is in the alpha grid, which can be brought online independently of the rest of lifelight. however, he can't simply be pulled out. bobby would need help in the danger to come. bobby goes to zadaa and convinces its traveler, loor, to come along to help him defeat the nightmares. she agrees, and they start the alpha grid up again, with aja acting as phader-vedder. they plan to get the source code from dr. zetlin and destroy the bug. however, the software is malfunctioning. rather than send them into zetlin's fantasy, it sends them into a "wild west" and thence into aja's own residence. they meet saint dane twice therein before they are pulled out. aja takes them to zetlin's fantasy, where zetlin resides in a massive building called the 'barbican', which can either stand upright or on its side. the first level of its structure is a tropical jungle filled with plant-animal life forms. the second level is a sort of large pool, with racing motorboats following lights. the level after that is a snow covered landscape, where bobby has to finish a race called slickshot in which six skaters need to pick up red balls and put them into buckets. unfortunately, only four people can finish the race. bobby finishes the race (with a bit of intervention from loor) and sees that zetlin is actually one of the racers, a popular sixteen-year-old called the "z" in his fantasy. bobby, loor and aja convince him to spill the code, which turns out to be "zero." when aja enters the code, it turns out that saint dane sabotaged it. the reality bug takes physical form(a black ameoba-like shapeshifter), and chases bobby, zetlin, aja, and loor around zetlin's fantasy home, and even into the real world when it grows too powerful to be contained by lifelight. they leave zetlin's jump and shut down all of lifelight, and the reality bug is destroyed. the travelers feel they have beaten saint dane&mdash;again. but at a ceremony congratulating aja and explaining the loss of lifelight, dr. sever, prime director of the program, steps up. she turns out to be saint dane in disguise, and she stirs up the crowd, promising to bring lifelight back online. he/she succeeds, everyone reenters lifelight, and saint dane receives his first victory. saddened, bobby sets off alone for eelong, leaving aja behind to seek some avenue of hope. aja trusts him. ||| 2 ||| 2
harry benson, a man in his 30s, suffers from psychomotor epilepsy. he often has seizures followed by blackouts, and then wakes up hours later with no knowledge of what he has done. during one of his seizures he severely beats two people. he is a prime candidate for an operation to implant electrodes and minicomputer in his brain to control the seizures. surgeons john ellis and morris are to perform the surgery, which is unprecedented for the time. in modern medicine, such a device would be called a brain pacemaker. the ramifications of the procedure are questioned by psychiatrist janet ross, and by an emeritus professor named manon at the lecture about the surgery. manon raises concerns that benson is psychotic (pointing to benson's adamant belief that there is no difference between man and machine) and the crimes he commits during the blackouts won't be curtailed. ellis admits that what they are doing isn't a cure but just a way to stimulate the brain when the computer senses a seizure coming on. it would prevent a seizure but not cure his personality disorder. despite the concerns voiced, the team decides to go ahead with the operation. the operation implants forty electrodes in benson's brain, controlled by a small computer that is powered by a plutonium power pack in his shoulder. benson must wear a dog tag that says to call the university hospital if he is injured, as his atomic power pack might emit radiation. while he is recovering, a woman named angela black gives morris a wig for benson, whose head was shaved prior to the operation. morris goes back to his normal work, where he interviews a man who volunteers to have electrodes put into his mind to stimulate pleasure. morris refuses him, but realizes that people like benson could potentially become addicts. he recalls a norwegian man, who was allowed to stimulate himself as much as he wanted, and did so much that it actually gave him brain damage. mcpherson, head of the neuropsychiatric department, interviews benson, who is still convinced machines are taking over the world. mcpherson realizes manon and ross were right and orders nurses to administer thorazine to benson. after resting for a day, benson goes through "interfacing". the forty electrodes in his brain are activated by computer technician gerhard, one by one, to see which ones would stop a seizure. each produces different results. one of the electrodes stimulates a sexual pleasure. ross asks gerhard to monitor benson. gerhard shows his findings to ross, who realizes that the seizures are getting more frequent. she explains that benson is learning to initiate seizures involuntarily because the result of these seizures is a shock of pleasure, which leads to him having more frequent seizures. ross checks on benson, and discovers that, due to a clerical error, benson has not been receiving his thorazine. she then finds out that benson has escaped from the hospital. ross goes to benson's house, but finds two girls instead who say he has a gun and blueprints for the basement of university hospital (where the computer mainframe is). ellis searches at a strip club where benson, who is fascinated with all things sexual, spends a lot of time. he doesn't find him. morris goes to his job, and meets benson's boss who said that benson feared the university hospital because of its ultra-modern computer system, an upgraded ibm system/360 ross is contacted by anders, a policeman who found benson's dogtag at the murder scene of angela black. after answering questions at the police station, ross goes home. benson arrives at her house, and has a seizure, which causes him to attack ross. ross manages to turn on her microwave, which disrupts the atomic pacemaker in his shoulder. he runs away. ross goes back to the hospital and goes to sleep. when angela black is brought back to the hospital for autopsy, pathologists find a book of matches that have the name of an airport. morris goes to this airport, and a bartender says he saw benson an hour ago leaving with joe, who took him to the hangar. morris goes to this hangar and finds joe severely beaten. he is in turn attacked by benson, who smashes the lower part of his face in with a steel pipe and then flees. ross, back at the hospital, is awakened by gerhard. she has a call from benson. when anders traces the call he realizes that benson is inside the hospital. gerhard's computers begin to malfunction, as if somebody was messing with the mainframe. anders and ross go down into the basement in search of benson. anders locates benson and has a brief firefight, injuring and disarming benson before becoming lost in the maze of corridors. benson goes back to the computer room to finish shutting down the computer mainframe and finds ross. ross picks up benson's gun, benson returns to the computer and goes to steal the gun from ross. after an intense (and tearful) internal struggle finally shoots and kills benson unintentionally. ||| 2 ||| 6
the novel begins with the discovery of a body hanging from a tree in the park. it doesn’t take long to figure out that this is no suicide, as the person had been shot several times before the hanging. after a little investigation the body is discovered to be that of libertarian national talk radio and television personality walter weeks. weeks was an influential man, and personal friend to the governor of massachusetts, so when the media finds out, jesse stone finds himself hounded by the governor, the media, and leading a very high profile case. stone begins his investigation by interviewing weeks’s ex-wives, manager, widow laurie weeks, and bodyguard conrad lutz. before long another twist is added to the crime when the body of weeks’s pregnant mistress turns up in the dumpster of a local restaurant. the medical examination soon discovers that this second victim was shot by the same gun, probably around the same time. as part of his investigation, stone has suitcase simpson check to see if weeks has any criminal convictions. the only one that turns up is an incident in baltimore in 1987 where weeks is found having sex in his car with a young woman. this seems unimportant at first, until jesse discovers that the arresting officer was weeks’s bodyguard, lutz. when questioned, lutz confirms that he had busted weeks while working as a baltimore police officer, but that later he and weeks struck up a friendship which ended in lutz becoming his bodyguard. the plot thickens when further investigation determines that laurie weeks was formerly lutz's wife. he also learns that weeks had planned on divorcing laurie and leaving his fortune to his new mistress and unborn child. after discovering this, chief stone and suitcase simpson head up to new york to stake out the widow’s apartment. while there they see lutz visiting her apartment during the day. they also witness weeks’s research assistant alan hendricks spending the night. this is interesting to jesse because alan was a frequent guest host, and the one writing most of the show's material by the end of weeks’s life. with hendricks the heir apparent to weeks’s media empire and expected to continue weeks’s shows, it now appears to jesse that laurie is trying to secure herself a new sugar daddy. with the assistance of an nypd officer, chief stone interrogates laurie in her apartment and records the interview. she confirms that she was once married to lutz. stone asks her if lutz could have held onto resentment concerning this and led him to kill weeks. she seems to ponder it and then confesses that she believes lutz could be the killer. back in paradise, jesse confronts lutz with the tape of his ex-wife’s accusation and lutz leaves the station without a word. lutz confesses everything over a glass of jack daniels to jesse that evening in his apartment. he tells jesse how after he busted weeks, his wife convinced him to blackmail weeks into giving him a job as his body guard. later weeks, a serial womanizer, took a liking to laurie. once again, laurie convinced lutz it would be for the best if they divorced and she married weeks. once she got his money, they could get back together and be rich. however, when she found out that he was going to divorce her and leave her with nothing she convinced lutz to kill him. so lutz took weeks and his mistress for a walk through of their new home on stiles island, near paradise. while there he shoots and kills them both on the beach. he then drags the bodies to the house and stores them in the refrigerator for several days. finally he hangs weeks on the tree in the park, and dumps the mistress in the restaurant dumpster. he does this to confuse the police and also to mess up their calculation of the time of death. he was counting on a dumb small town sheriff not knowing what to do, but he got jesse stone. he then tells jesse he is going to leave and will shoot jesse if he tries to stop him. he pulls his gun on jesse and jesse shoots him dead, essentially committing suicide by cop. it was jesse’s revelation that laurie was now sleeping with alan hendricks and her taped accusation that leads him to do this. ||| 1 ||| 6
the long, bitterly fought company war between earth and union had ended – for everyone, except conrad mazian, commander of the earth company fleet. by refusing to accept the peace, he and his loyal mazianni became outlaws, hunted by all sides. elizabeth 'bet' yeager had been one of mazian's marines, a twenty year veteran. stranded on pell station when the fleet was forced to pull out abruptly (as told in downbelow station), she managed to blend in with the many displaced war refugees. since then, she survived by taking whatever starship berths she could find. her luck begins to run out when her latest ship, the freighter ernestine, is forced to return to pell for major repairs, a destination too fraught with danger for her. she stays behind on the decrepit, dying thule station. day after day, she goes to the employment office, but there is little work. few starships call and the ones that do, do not need her. late one night, while trying to sleep in a dockside washroom, she is attacked by a man and barely manages to kill him. in desperation, weak from hunger, she moves in with a lowlife bartender. when he tries to control her, with threats to go to the authorities about his suspicions about her, she dispatches him too. with time running out before his body is discovered, she signs up with the ship loki, a barely legitimate 'spook' that survives by gathering intelligence and selling it. loki is not a typical merchanter ship; instead of a close-knit family, the crew consists of unrelated hire-ons. as a result, various competing cliques have formed aboard and bet has to navigate her way among them. she becomes friends with musa, a universally respected crewman who claims to have served on one of the ancient sublighters, the original nine vessels that predated faster-than-light ships. she is also strongly attracted to ramey, an ex-merchanter and surly outcast with a nickname of ng (no good). she gradually makes a place for herself and even manages to get the reluctant ng tentatively readmitted back into shipboard society. things get complicated when she is forced to reveal her past, especially since loki is currently hunting a mazianni ship. long overdue for a major overhaul, loki limps into thule, hooks up to the sole starship fuel pump and takes on all the available fuel. while there, the ship they were searching for (keu's india) shows up. the mazianni ship had been harried and hunted by alliance and union forces to the point that it was blocked from its regular supply bases and is desperately low on fuel. keu needs to take the precious pump and fuel intact, so he can not just blow loki up. instead, he sends boarding parties of armored marines, but bet and ng between them manage to hold them off. then the alliance warship norway arrives to close the trap and administer the coup de grâce. bet's actions during the battle prove to her crewmates that she can be trusted; she has found a (relatively) safe haven. ||| 5 ||| 5

despite the passage of time, major quilan still suffers grief and bereavement from the death of his wife, killed during the chelgrian civil war that resulted from the culture's interference. quilan is offered the chance to avenge the lost chelgrians who died in a civil war and is inducted into a plot to strike back at the culture. as part of the plot, his "soulkeeper" (a device normally used to store its owner's personality upon their death) is equipped with both the mind of a long-dead chelgrian general and a device that can transport wormholes connected to weapons caches. quilan is then sent to masaq' orbital, ostensibly to persuade mahrai ziller to return to his native chel but is in reality on a suicide mission to destroy the orbital's hub mind. to protect him from detection at masaq', quilan's memory is selectively blanked until he reaches his target. on masaq', ziller lives in self-imposed exile, having renounced his privileged position in chel's caste system. an accomplished composer, he has been commissioned to compose music to mark the anniversary of the idiran-culture war. upon hearing of quilan's visit, and his reason for travel, ziller scrupulously avoids him, reluctant to engage with a civilization that repels him. quilan succeeds in placing the wormholes in the mind's hub, but the mind detects them immediately and, although not able to track the location of the other end of the wormholes, suggests that the involved "aliens" assisting quilan's mission may have been a group of culture minds seeking to keep the culture from being too complacent. having struggled with its memories from the idiran-culture war, when it was the general systems vehicle lasting damage, the mind reveals to quilan that it seeks to cease existing and offers to take quilan with it. they both die. in the end of the novel, a nightmarishly efficient e-dust assassin is unleashed against the chelgrian priest who was responsible, as well as his immediate co-conspirators. it is not revealed whether this was a form of retribution by the culture or a cover-up by a secret culture faction. ||| 5 ||| 5
a group of 42,363 union humans and azi are dispatched to set up a base on a very rare habitable planet named gehenna ii. unknown to the settlers, their mission is designed to fail; they are deliberately abandoned in order to create long-term problems for the rival alliance. the native caliban are first presented as annoying lizard-like creatures. the humans at first attempt to keep them outside a perimeter or to drive them away. in time, larger and larger caliban are seen, with differences in color, size, and even a social structure (some caliban are subservient to the larger, different-colored caliban). it becomes clear that the creatures are capable of communication, at least at the level of symbology, and of developing empathic or possibly telepathic links to humans. eventually a symbiosis develops, with some of the caliban pairing off with humans. over a period of decades and several generations cut off from resupply, the colonists lapse into a primitive lifestyle. by necessity, the azi are allowed to raise families. the non-azi humans are in the minority from the beginning and over time, intermarry with the majority. an alliance mission first seeks to intervene, then withdraws from direct contact, content to watch as two quasi-feudal, fundamentally opposed societies develop, while a third, smaller group called the "weirds" becomes much more closely associated with the caliban, living with them rather than the other humans and becoming less comprehensible in the process. the novel follows several generations of descendants of one particular azi, who establish different lines and rise to become the leaders of two rival cultures. historical moments depict the decline of the colony, the establishment of human/azi-caliban relations, cultural development, and the planetary environment. finally, the two cultures, one "masculine"-aggressive, the other more "feminine"-receptive, meet and fight for dominance. a union delegation arrives at the very end, just in time to be given short shrift by elai, the girl-ruler who has emerged victorious. ||| 5 ||| 5

within the galactic empire, a change of fief is occurring. led by the verbose baron vladimir, house hardchargin, the great big house given charge of arruckus, has been displaced by shaddap iv, the padedbrah emperor, in favor of the up-and-coming house agamemnides, with duke lotto at its head. arruckus is also known as "doon", and is additionally known as the dessert planet. covered entirely in sugars, it is a harsh unforgiving environment, where not an entree can be found; the natives live entirely on whatever they can import, produce from the sugars, or produce from soy protein (the native food experiments known as the mahn t'vani) duke lotto accepts the fief, aware that it may well be a death trap but also conscious of the importance of arruckus's only export, the wide-spectrum intoxicant known as beer. found naturally on arruckus as a result of natural processes and nowhere else, it is the engine on which commerce runs; the schlepping guild, who has a monopoly on space travel in the imperium, will not run without it. who controls the beer controls commerce. but soon after arriving on doon, with his heir and son pall and his concubine the lady jazzica, an adept of the galaxy-spanning sisterhood of chefs and event planners known as the boni maroni, duke lotto and house agamemnides fall victim to a scheme originated by baron vladimir hardchargin and implemented by the duke's own accountant oyeah, who, without the duke's knowledge, kept a secret second ledger. when the emperor called for an audit of the fief, the duplicate ledger made it appear as though house agamemnides had been cooking the books. in return for this act, oyeah hoped the baron would give him a start as a stand-up comic–which he did, but on the imperial prison planet, salacia simplicissimus. ruined, duke lotto's brief reign over doon is ended and house hardchargin is reinstated as fief-holders. banished to the sugared wilderness, pall (now head of house agamemnides) and lady jazzica meet with and are eventually accepted by the planet's native population, the freedmenmen, a process made easier by previous prophecy-seeding by the missionaria phonibalonica, via the great prophet phyllis. indeed, the natives are receptive to the fulfillment of the prophecies even after the revelation that phyllis's decanonization resulted in her prophecies being discontinued sometime before. pall, given the freedmenmen name assol and taking the secret name mauve'bib (after the purple napkin that all freedmenmen wear about their necks) begins to ascend the power structure of the tribe (as well as the freedmenmen girl loni as his lover), realizing that he could use the freedmenmen to return to a position of power, taking back not only doon but the imperium itself. he also realizes what the planet's imperial planetologist and liberal economist, keynes, had puzzled out some time before: the rampaging giant pretzels (known as schmai-gunug) actually produces the beer as a byproduct of its very life-cycle. the lady jazzica ascends to the status of revved-up mother of hootch grabr, becoming known as jazzica-of-the-weirdness. during her ascension, while getting drunk on the beer, she realizes that she carries lotto's daughter. her intoxication opens her foetal daughter to the thousands of years of boni maroni culinary history; the result is nailya-the-truly-weird, a toddler who spouts recipes as though she were an adult. during this time, he knowingly positions himself as the kumquat haagendasz (the result of a generations-long breeding program so secret that the boni maroni have actually forgotten the point) and the mahdl-t, the long hoped-for freedmenmen messiah, "he who will drive us to paradise and back", who will finally bring the entrees the freedmenmen have hungered for. by this route, he assumes and consolidates his power over the natives, not only making them his allies, but his fanatic followers. meanwhile, back in power, baron vladimir hardchargin has his own problems. converting the fief into the shadvlad rendezvous, the galaxy's premier lounge planet, is a relative success, even though the freedmenmen remain a chronic problem and the giant pretzels remain at large. he is hungry for more success, though, and has plans to muscle out his silent partner (the emperor) and play the imperial house against the boni moroni, the schlepping guild, and the interstellar development cooperative noamchomski using his control of beer as leverage, thereby becoming the true power in the galaxy, and franchising the shadvlad across the imperium. events come to a head when pall mauve'bib, gone completely native and acquiring the "eye of the egad" (the telltale red-on-red eyes, indicating severe beer addiction) challenges the baron to a bake-off, with a new ingredient: peanut butter, rendered from the naturally-occurring snack mix's peanuts, and debuting his secret weapon – a liqueur made from beer – drambrewski. with the support of the boni moroni thereon, the promise of an assured supply of beer to the schlepping guild (who had been influenced to believe that the hardchargins have been watering the beer, and are revealed to have the red-on-red eyes of beer addiction), and after dispatching the shanana-baron flip-rotha hardchargin in rankout (single insult-combat), pall mauve'bib assumes imperial control, banishing the emperor's house to the prison plant simplicissima secundus, acquiring the hand of the emperor's daughter serutan in a marriage of convenience, and the freedmenmen woman loni as his concubine. ||| 5 ||| 2

in the book, shirky recounts how social tools such as blogging software like wordpress and twitter, file sharing platforms like flickr, and online collaboration platforms like wikipedia support group conversation and group action in a way that previously could only be achieved through institutions. in the same way the printing press increased individual expression, and the telephone increased communications between individuals, shirky argues that with the advent of online social tools, groups can form without the previous restrictions of time and cost. shirky observes that: "[every] institution lives in a kind of contradiction: it exists to take advantage of group effort, but some of its resources are drained away by directing that effort. call this the institutional dilemma--because an institution expends resources to manage resources, there is a gap between what those institutions are capable of in theory and in practice, and the larger the institution, the greater those costs." online social tools, shirky argues, allow groups to form around activities &#39;whose costs are higher than the potential value,&#39; for institutions. shirky further argues that the successful creation of online groups relies on successful fusion of a, &#39;plausible promise, an effective tool, and an acceptable bargain for the user.&#39; however, shirky warns that this system should not be interpreted as a recipe for the successful use of social tools as the interaction between the components is too complex. shirky also discusses the possibility of &#34;mass amateurization&#34; that the internet allows. with blogging and photo-sharing websites, anyone can publish an article or photo that they have created. this creates a mass amateurization of journalism and photography, requiring a new definition of what credentials make someone a journalist, photographer, or news reporter. this mass amateurization threatens to change the way news is spread throughout different media outlets. ||| 4 ||| 4
helikaon, king of dardania, and his unfulfilled love for andromache, now wife of hektor, continues to be the central theme of this novel. however, the story is dominated by two surviving mykene warriors turned outlaws - kalliades and banokles—who flee the wrath of agamemnon, rescue a mysterious woman piria (who turns out to be a runaway priestess, whose real name is kalliope, and a royal princess). the three are themselves rescued by odysseus, whose past is gradually revealed. odysseus, like other kings, is headed for troy to participate in the wedding celebrations of hektor and andromache. in the meantime, helikaon has been seriously wounded by the assassin karpophorus and only gradually returns to health. andromache approaches hektor, seeking an end to their engagement, only to learn a closely guarded secret concerning his manhood. her earlier visit to king priam revealed a harsh truth, upon which she acts much later. by the last third of the book, troy is at war with agamemnon and his allies. the greek battleplan is rather different from that in the iliad but makes sense historically. (perhaps gemmell was inspired by mithridates or the greek-persian wars.) what happens next is a stunning set of reverses engineered by long-term planning and long-concealed treachery. in the last book, troy: fall of kings (published in august 2007; u.s. edition due in december), the war between the trojans and the greeks will come to its climax. it:l'ombra di troia pl:troja: tarcza gromu ||| 2 ||| 2

thirty-year-old george davies can’t bring himself to hold his newborn son. after months of accepting his lame excuses and strange behavior, his wife has had enough. she demands that he see a therapist, and george, desperate to save his unraveling marriage and redeem himself as a father and husband, reluctantly agrees. as he delves into his childhood memories, he begins to recall things he hasn’t thought of in twenty years. events, people, and strange situations come rushing back. the odd, rambling letters his father sent home before he died. the jovial mother who started dating too soon after his father’s death. a boy who appeared one night when george was lonely, then told him secrets he didn’t want to know. how no one believed this new friend was real and that he was responsible for the bad things that were happening. terrified by all that he has forgotten, george struggles to remember what really happened in the months following his father’s death. were his ominous visions and erratic behavior the product of a grief-stricken child’s overactive imagination (a perfectly natural reaction to the trauma of loss, as his mother insisted)? or were his father’s colleagues, who blamed a darker, more malevolent force, right to look to the supernatural as a means to end george’s suffering? twenty years later, george still does not know. but when a mysterious murder is revealed, remembering the past becomes the only way george can protect himself–and his young family. ||| 6 ||| 6
the novel opens as an experimental star ship tests a deadly weapon on an uninhabited world, devastating the surface. from here the story essentially follows the two main characters as they are recruited by the sutherlin alliance in their bid to overthrow the alcon empire. the junior of the two opens the story as a pilot in the empire’s prestigious devil squadron. the senior recruit had also once served in this fighter group only to resign years early and take up the life of a mercenary and bounty hunter. with these two skilled men added to their backbone of ex-imperial soldiers and raw youth from around the galaxy the alliance takes the fight to the empire. with the threat of the alliance growing the empire learns of their location and decides to unleash the power of their world killing star ship. the two recruited men learn of the ship’s existence and its target just days before its use and develop a plan of attack to cripple both the ship and the sizable force escorting it. one of the themes that is expressed throughout the story is attachment and the human need to belong; both main characters fight with these needs in their own ways. the elder of the two battles the desire with his own wishes to stay separate from the needs of the others while the younger fights to keep his distance, not wanting to feel the loss of war. ||| 5 ||| 5
the actual story is classic simmons in its literary allusions, with epigraphs from ezra pound's cantos; the protagonist's father is a pound scholar with an especial interest in the cantos (reading from it to his children), and the premise can be seen as deriving from a line in the cantos as well. the mother of the family has died of some unspecified illness. stricken by grief, the father bargains (heedless of the prospect of financial ruin) with the "resurrectionists" to have his wife's corpse technologically revived. the resurrection is a hollow one, as all higher cognitive functions are irreparably damaged, although it does function somewhat autonomously. their family is stigmatized, and the father slowly breaks down and his classes become less and less popular until he takes a sabbatical to write his long-planned work on the cantos. he spends most of it drunk. simon, the protagonist's brother, eventually commits suicide. a few years later, while the protagonist is at university (sponsored by the resurrectionists, whom he has joined) the father commits suicide as well. he graduates and begins working for them and helping to spread the living dead. he does little but work, spending his free time with his resurrected family. ||| 5 ||| 5

the story opens on 7 february 1141, a few days after the battle of lincoln. brother cadfael is a benedictine monk at shrewsbury abbey, of welsh origins and formerly a widely travelled soldier and seaman. england is in the grip of civil war, as king stephen and the empress maud are contending for the throne. shrewsbury and the county of shropshire are loyal to king stephen and a contingent from the county has gone to fight for him at lincoln. hugh beringar, deputy sheriff for the county, returns with the survivors, bringing news of a disastrous defeat. stephen has been captured, and the future of england is uncertain. gilbert prestcote, sheriff of shropshire, has also been taken prisoner by welshmen allied to empress maud under madog ap maredudd, lord of powys in mid wales, and cadwaladr ap gruffydd, the brother of owain gwynedd, ruler of gwynedd in north wales. a few days later, sister magdalen, a friend of cadfael who effectively runs the benedictine convent at godric's ford a few miles from shrewsbury, reports that some of the welshmen returning from lincoln tried to raid the convent but were easily driven off, leaving as a prisoner a young man who had fallen into a stream and nearly drowned. he pretends to speak no english, but brother cadfael, sent to treat his wounds, quickly sees through the deception. chagrined, the prisoner identifies himself as elis ap cynan, a distant cousin of owain gwynedd. hugh beringar dispatches cadfael into wales to negotiate an exchange of prisoners; elis for gilbert prestcote. cadfael proceeds to tregeiriog in gwynedd close to the border with england, the holding of owain's retainer tudur ap rhys and where owain's court is temporarily established. he meets tudur's daughter cristina, who was betrothed in infancy to elis, and eliud, elis's foster-brother. he overhears cristina and eliud arguing bitterly, and concludes that cristina is jealous of the friendship between eliud and elis, which is making elis neglect cristina. while cadfael is away in wales, elis has met gilbert prestcote's daughter melicent, and they have fallen in love. melicent believes that her father will never consent to their marriage. a party under einon ab ithel, one of owain's captains, brings prestcote from wales. eliud accompanies them, as einon's groom and as the planned hostage to remain in shrewsbury while elis returns to wales. prestcote is ill and wounded, and is taken to the infirmary at shrewsbury abbey. while einon dines with abbot radulfus and hugh beringar, elis tells eliud of his love for melicent and his intention to ask her father for her hand in marriage. eliud protests, but elis goes to prestcote's room, only to be ejected from the ward by brother edmund, the infirmarer. as einon prepares to leave, eliud asks cadfael to go with him to recover einon's cloak, which had been left behind in prestcote's room. they find that prestcote is dead, smothered in his sleep. einon has been in company throughout his visit to the abbey and thus has an alibi, but eliud and other welshmen of his party must remain as suspects, as must elis. after einon departs for wales, melicent accuses elis of murdering her father to remove the obstacle to their marriage. as elis protests his innocence, cadfael belatedly recalls that an ornate gold pin which had fastened einon ab ithel's cloak was missing when prestcote was found dead. it had presumably been stolen from prestcote's chamber by the murderer. elis does not have it, but remains under suspicion, and under melicent's contempt. he and eliud are allowed to share a cell in shrewsbury castle under their parole of honour not to leave the castle. melicent later departs for godric's ford with sister magdalen, with a half-formed intention of joining the convent. cadfael examines the body of prestcote carefully and recovers richly-dyed woollen threads and even some gold thread, which came from whatever was used to smother him. neither elis's clothing nor any other cloth within the abbey matches them. suspicion meanwhile falls on anion ap griffri, a half-welsh lay servant of the abbey who was in the infirmary with a leg injury at the time of prestcote's death. it is known that his half-brother had been hanged by prestcote for his part in a fatal brawl, he was heard by a blind monk in the infirmary (who recognised the tapping of his crutch) to enter prestcote's chamber and he has fled, presumably into wales. reports reach hugh beringar of raids by empress maud's allies into the northern part of the county, and he has to take most of his armed men to join forces with owain gwynedd and deal with them. elis and eliud warn him that welshmen from powys are likely to seek revenge for their earlier failure and raid godric's ford in his absence. elis in particular is anxious for melicent's safety. as elis and eliud fear, the men of powys gather for a raid. cadfael meanwhile wonders whether einon ab ithel innocently took with him the rich cloth with which prestcote was smothered. with abbot radulfus's permission, he takes news of the threatened raid to tregeiriog, where owain gwynedd, einon and hugh beringar are expected. there, cristina asks him for news of elis and eliud. he realises that his first impression was mistaken. cristina and eliud are in love with each other but eliud had refused to speak to anyone of his love, out of loyalty to his foster-brother. when owain arrives later, a local man named griffri ap llywarch asks owain to acknowledge his illegitimate child, anion ap griffri, as his heir. he is wearing einon's gold pin stolen from prestcote's chamber. einon arrives at the same time and accuses griffri of theft. anion admits taking the pin, and owain is prepared to convict him of prestcote's murder also. cadfael intercedes, and establishes that anion mistakenly thought the pin was prestcote's, and took it to give to his father in compensation for his hanged half-brother, under the welsh tradition of paying a "blood price" for a death. anion swears that prestcote was alive, though asleep, when he removed the pin. cadfael testifies that anion never possessed the sumptuous cloth which was the murder weapon and that another, fit man was heard to enter prescote's chamber after anion left it. anion is declared a free man. at dawn, before owain and einon can properly examine the threads from the cloth used to smother prestcote, hugh beringar arrives in haste, with news that the raiders from powys are nearing godric's ford. he obtains fresh horses and prepares to pursue them. in the bustle, cadfael catches sight of einon ab ithel's ornate saddlecloth and realises it was the murder weapon. now knowing who the murderer is, he asks owain gwynedd whether prestcote's murder must be atoned for by another death, pleading that atonement by penitence would be preferable. owain agrees that mere revenge is pointless but is otherwise noncommittal, and cadfael does not yet reveal the murderer's identity. the news of the raid also reaches shrewsbury castle. elis overhears the messenger and, frantic with worry for melicent, he breaks his parole, leaves the castle, and makes his way to godric's ford on foot. hugh beringar's inexperienced lieutenant, alan herbard, sets out to intercept the raiders. he takes eliud with him, under sentence of death if elis proves false. as the raiders prepare to attack the convent, elis confronts them, telling them they are shameful to attack innocent holy women. a welshman looses an arrow at him, but eliud throws himself in front of elis and is badly wounded. elis's intervention has given time for beringar and herbard to arrive, and the raiders are routed and flee into powys. as cadfael treats eliud's wound, eliud confesses to the murder of prestcote. he confirms what cadfael already knew; that eliud, frantic to delay the return of elis to wales to wed cristina, went to prestcote's chamber to recover einon ab ithel's cloak while almost everyone else in the abbey was at dinner. he was carrying einon's saddlecloth and on the spur of the moment, he smothered prestcote with it, as elis could not be exchanged for a dead man. he left the cloak behind, and later asked cadfael to accompany him to the room as a charade, to ensure that the death was discovered before elis could leave the abbey. melicent, already convinced by elis's actions of his innocence, overhears the confession. hugh beringar has no option but to try eliud for prestcote's murder, and almost certainly hang him, when he is fit to be tried. elis has also been wounded, and hugh sends the welshmen of einon ab ithel's party who are still at shrewsbury to carry him back to wales. cadfael, sister magdalene, elis and melicent conspire to substitute an unconscious eliud for elis, thus removing eliud from hugh's jurisdiction. although exasperated, beringar does not press any charge against elis and melicent, who are properly betrothed. eliud and cristina are presumably reunited in wales, where justice lies with owain gwynedd. cadfael observes to hugh beringar that even god, when he intends mercy, needs tools to his hand.

the story is set on cybertron, the home planet of the transformers. it has been several centuries since cybertron's golden age of space exploration and planetary colonisation, and cybertron's society has declined into a state of decadence. the planet's many space bridges have went offline due to years of neglect, and as a result cybertron has lost contact with the other planets that the transformers colonised during the golden age. when a new transformer is born from the well of all sparks (which contains the allspark, the device that creates new transformers), they are assigned to a caste and guild from which they may never deviate throughout their lives. castes are separated into a hierarchy, with the highest castes relating to science, art and government, while the lower castes are given to manual labourers in factories and underground mines. those in the lowest castes are not given individual names. in the industrial city of kaon, gladiatorial combat grows in popularity among the lower castes. one of the gladiators, a labourer who completely opposes the caste system and calls himself "megatronus" after one of the original thirteen transformers, rises to power and becomes a local celebrity due to his skills in the gladiatorial pits. megatronus' fans and followers shorten his name to "megatron" in their chants, and the name sticks. in the city of iacon, a clerk named orion pax, who works in cybertron's hall of records and also dislikes the caste system, begins watching megatron's political speeches and eventually contacts megatron to discuss their similar political views. megatron champions a free cybertron, with each individual determining their own path in life, and orion finds this highly appealing. orion turns for guidance to his supervisor and mentor alpha trion, who encourages him to meet with megatron in kaon, cryptically stating that a great destiny awaits both orion and megatron. taking alpha trion's advise, orion travels to kaon and meets megatron in person, along with two of his followers, shockwave and soundwave. orion and megatron engage in intense but friendly debates over the nature of free will, and they find broad agreement in the need for a new form of cybertronian government. however, megatron favours confrontation and revolution, while orion hopes to inspire the masses to change the system from within. as megatron's political movement gains power, it also grows more violent. terrorists professing allegiance to megatron commit multiple bombings across cybertron, one of these bombings destroys the "six lasers over cybertron" amusement park. megatron repeatedly states in public speeches that he does not know the terrorists and did not orchestrate these attacks, and at one point orion even vocally defends him. the terrorists then attack the altihex casino in the city of altihex, where sentinel prime (the main political leader of cybertron) is attending a show. when the bombings start, sentinel relies on his three bodyguards, starscream, skywarp and thundercracker, to escort him to safety. however, the three bodyguards are actually part of the plot as well, and they take sentinel to kaon and present him to megatron. starscream flirts with joining megatron's forces, but seeing sentinel as a potential bargaining chip he doesn't allow megatron to kill him, and instead orders skywarp and thundercracker to take sentinel to trypticon station, a scientific space station that orbits cybertron. to prevent an all-out war, alpha trion helps orion and megatron secure an audience before the cybertron high council in order to plead their case. the council members are hostile to any notion of change and view megatron as nothing but a criminal. megatron continues to disown the terrorist attacks being committed in his name but continues to appeal for the total removal of the caste system, including the council itself. his words are supported by the lower castes in the council's audience, who have started calling themselves "decepticons". by contrast, orion makes a more noble appeal to the council. he points out that earlier generations of transformers would never have been able to repel the quintessons (an alien race that tried to invade cybertron centuries ago) if they had been constrained by such a caste system. he proclaims their fuller potential as a race if each individual were to be acknowledged as an autonomous robot, using the ancient term "autobot" as an expression of that ideal. after his speech, the council member halogen agrees that the two radicals might have a point, and that cybertronian society might have become too static for its own good. recognizing the depth of the crisis that cybertron faces, halogen asserts that they need new visionary leadership to guide a social rebirth. the council, impressed by orion's morals, appoint orion as the new leader of cybertron, giving him a new name and title: optimus prime. however, orion's sudden elevation destroys his friendship with megatron, who is outraged and believes the situation to be a set-up. megatron kills halogen at once, but as the crowd marshals for war, optimus prime manages to convince megatron not to commit further violence within the council halls. the two sides retreat from the halls and the great war between optimus prime's autobots and megatron's decepticons begins. the war is brutal and largely one-sided. the autobots retain control of two cities, iacon and kalis, while the decepticons take over everywhere else on the planet. out of desperation, the autobots launch the allspark into space to keep megatron from gaining control of the source of transformer life. seeking a new advantage, megatron orders starscream to give him access to trypticon station's stockpile of dark energon, a power-enhancing substance that according to legend is the blood of the mythical being unicron. the decepticons consume the dark energon and become extremely powerful, gaining a combat edge and overwhelming the struggling autobots. megatron then seeks control of the plasma energy chamber at cybertron's core, planning to flood it with dark energon, which would permanently empower his own forces while poisoning cybertron and starving the autobots to death. but in order to activate the chamber, he needs to acquire two code keys. one of these keys is stored within sentinel prime's chest, and megatron acquires it by brutally murdering him. before megatron can fully activate the plasma energy chamber though, the autobots reactivate omega supreme, an enormous robot that transforms into both a rocket ship and a city, and once served as cybertron's guardian. while transforming from a city to a rocket ship, omega supreme nearly crushes megatron and the decepticons, but they narrowly avoid getting killed by the giant. omega supreme takes off with the plasma energy chamber and attempts to fly it to safety, but starscream leads an aerial assault that manages to shoot him down, and after megatron empowers himself with dark energon, he effortlessly defeats the autobots and omega supreme's robot mode. he then floods the plasma energy chamber with dark energon and sends it back into the core of cybertron. as the dark energon flows throughout cybertron, optimus prime ventures into the core to fix the plasma energy chamber, accompanied by the autobots bumblebee and jetfire. once they find it, bumblebee manages to extract the chamber from the core, stopping the flow of dark energon, and optimus receives a mental communication from the core itself, which is sentient. with the flow of dark energon stopped, the core will eventually be able to heal itself, but it will take centuries, and during that time the core will not be able to generate enough energon to sustain the population it currently does. the transformers will either have to abandon the planet until it heals, or risk starvation. to show him not to lose hope, the core bestows optimus prime with the matrix of leadership. seeing that the planet will soon be uninhabitable, optimus prime orders a mass exodus of the autobot army, but most of the ships are shot down by trypticon station. one autobot ship, the eight track, is able to link up to trypticon station and force it to crash into cybertron, but as it falls the station transforms into an enormous, reptilian monster and goes on a rampage. alpha trion grows ever more despairing for cybertron, and he sets a radical plan into motion: the construction of the largest spaceship in cybertronian history, the ark, on which most of the autobots may escape. several autobots, including alpha trion, ultra magnus, jetfire and a newly-repaired omega supreme, volunteer to stay on cybertron and protect what little territory the autobots still hold. despite optimus's strong wishes, alpha trion refuses to leave cybertron and declares the time has come for optimus to make his own command decisions without his advise. as most of the autobots flee to the ark and it takes off into space, megatron commands trypticon to transform into an equally large spaceship, the nemesis, in which megatron and most of the decepticons will give pursuit. before they leave, megatron appoints shockwave as the dictator of cybertron, ordering him to destroy all remaining autobots by the time megatron returns. with the nemesis in hot pursuit, the autobots fly the ark to the last intact space bridge, but because no one alive knows how to use it, there is no guarantee taht the space bridge will work. but as the two giant spaceships get within range of the space bridge, it does indeed activate and teleports them to an uncharted part of space. with no decepticons in sight, the ark detects the energy signature of the allspark. optimus prime orders the ark pilots to follow the signal, and their adventure in space begins. ||| 2 ||| 5
a year after his brother lyam's coronation as king, arutha returns to his city as the new prince of krondor, to begin plans for his wedding. jimmy the hand, a young thief, foils an assassination attempt on the prince by a fellow thief, and feeling loyalty toward the prince from previously aiding his escape from the city with princess anita (in magician), he chooses to warn the prince of the attempt on his life instead of reporting the traitor to the mockers, krondor's powerful and highly organized guild of thieves. arutha seeks the mockers' cooperation to obtain more information on the assassins, and at their request, makes jimmy a squire of his court. setting a trap, they capture two agents, who are revealed to be operating out of the temple of lims-kragma, goddess of death, one of whom is a moredhel whose appearance has been altered. during interrogation, both prisoners will themselves to death rather than divulge their plans. as the high priestess of lims-kragma seeks the truth by bringing them back from beyond the grave, one of the prisoners rises by the power of an unknown enemy, and attacks his captors, slaughtering many royal guards, and addressing arutha as "lord of the west" before being destroyed by father nathan, a priest of sung. injured in the attack, the high priestess warns arutha that the forces which opposed him were so powerful that they held the gods in contempt. arutha leads a strike on the assassins' hideout in krondor, but even as the assault appears to be going in their favor, the assassins begin rising from the dead and renewing their attack. many of arutha's men are slain, and the black slayers are only defeated when the entire building is burned to the ground. believing the threat to be over for the time being, arutha proceeds with his wedding. just before the ceremony, jimmy senses something is wrong, and finds the same assassin from the first attempt on arutha's life hiding on the roof. he manages to disrupt the assassin just as he is firing at arutha, but the poisoned bolt strikes anita instead. the assassin is interrogated, and reveals the enemy to be murmandamus, a moredhel chieftain and powerful sorcerer. according to a prophecy, arutha is the only force that stands in the way of murmandamus's total destruction of the kingdom and domination over the realm. the assassin also reveals that the poison was given to him by a moredhel agent, who called it "silverthorn". pug is able to keep anita under a spell that slows the passage of time, giving arutha time to search for an antidote. with scant clues, he secretly leads a party to the one place most likely to have the answer to any question, the great library at sarth abbey. all along his journey, he is tracked by murad, one of murmandamus's top generals. they manage to reach the abbey, but their enemies strike again with powerful sorcery, both attacks barely repulsed by the mighty defenses of sarth abbey and its priests. from information gathered at the abbey, arutha's quest turns to the elves of elvandar for more information. meanwhile, pug returns to stardock to seek the aid of a scryer, whose vision of the future reveals a dark force behind murmandamus, a powerful enemy speaking in ancient tsurani, who is even capable of perceiving the scryer past the barriers of time and probability. believing the threat therefore to be a danger to both worlds, pug seeks more information from the tsurani assembly of magicians, and with the help of research from the books of macros, creates a new rift to kelewan and returns to his old estate with two companions, posing as priests. in elvandar, arutha is told that the silverthorn plant can also serve as the cure, and grows only around the lake moraelin, in moredhel-held territory, surrounded by a barrier the elves are unable to pass. he and his band set out for moraelin. in kelewan, pug arrives to find himself removed from the assembly and declared an outlaw. his old friend and fellow great one hochopepa is willing to aid him, but they are captured by a great one loyal to the current warlord, who seeks to gain control of the empire. tortured by the warlord and his inquisitors, and with his greater path magic neutralized, pug turns to the lesser path, becoming the second magician ever to master both paths after macros the black. he is able to overcome his captors, and explains his reasons for returning to the emperor, who grants him reprieve to continue his search in the assembly's vast libraries. he arrives at the conclusion that the ancient tsurani enemy has returned, posing a grave threat to both worlds. pug is reinstated by the assembly, and following a clue, travels to the northern polar wastelands of kelewan, discovering a lost race of elves living in a forest under the ice, twin to elvandar on midkemia. their leader, acaila, offers to instruct pug in magic over the course of the following year, in order to better face the coming trials. meanwhile, arutha and his band manage to sneak past the moredhel sentries, and discover several silverthorn shrubs in the lake, and make their escape back towards elvandar. just as they are about to reach the safety of the elven forest, they are overtaken by murad and a band of black slayers. with the help of tomas, they manage to defeat their enemies and return safely to elvandar. with the antidote made by the elven spellweavers, anita is saved, and arutha's enemies set back by the death of one of their generals. but murmandamus vows to regather his armies the next year, and the long-awaited invasion into the kingdom will commence. fr:silverthorn nl:zilverdoorn pl:srebrzysty cierń ||| 2 ||| 2
(conflict, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution) charley goddard is a fifteen-year-old boy growing up in the farming community of winona, minnesota, in 1861, just prior to what will become the civil war. he lives with his single mother and little brother, orren. charley's father was killed when a swarm of bees landed on a horse, scaring it into kicking charley's father in the face, killing him. the whole area is talking about what they think will be a "shooting war." the atmosphere at the town meetings discussing the possibility is festive, with flags and drums and patriotic speeches. as a volunteer army is beginning to form, charley decides he wants to be part of it after a brief argument with his mother. everyone assumes that it will be an easy, victorious battle, most likely over in a month or two if it happens at all. charley lies about his age and joins the volunteers in what he thinks will be a fun experience that will make him a man. they pay is eleven dollars a month, much more than he makes working on the farms. charley trains and learns to be a soldier. in his letters, charley describes the experience as something much different than he had imagined. upon leaving the camp, the men are treated as heroes even before they leave town, accompanied by much cheering and flag waving. on the train ride to their new camping location, charley meets a slave, who quickly blesses him and gives him bread for what he is doing for the southern slaves. however, a slave owner soon finds the woman and drags her back inside her house as the train departs again. charley feels great, and spirits are high. however, not long after, he finds himself in his first battle. the union soldiers lose badly. he is caught in the middle of violent suffering and death, and he cannot believe what is happening so suddenly all around him. when the battle is over, hundreds of his comrades have been killed, and charley and the other survivors are stunned. it was named the battle of manassas junction by some newspapers but was quickly called the battle of bull run by some of the men, for the creek that ran nearby. a camp is created near washington and eventually reaches ninety thousand men. charley becomes part of the day-to-day routine of the camp. he and the others forage the farms in the area for food and eventually build log houses to live in during the approaching winter. however, many men get diseases such as dysentery and die in the camp. during the time here, charley participates in one nearby battle against the rebel soldiers. the union wins, but not without losing many men. one of them is a man whom charley befriended only hours before. his name is nelson, and he is shot in the stomach. nelson knows the surgeons do not have the skills or time to mend his wound and that he will be left to die. as a result, he kills himself on the battlefield as the other soldiers leave for the return march to the camp. charley takes part in a battle near richmond, virginia where the confederate army uses its mounted cavalry to charge charley and the union soldiers. nearly one hundred men on horseback charge the six hundred foot soldiers. charley and the others are told to shoot the horses in order to defeat the cavalry, and they do so, killing every horse and man. he then fights a large army of confederate soldiers. after all the fighting is over he is told he has been shot in the shoulder, but when he arrives at the temporary hospital he is told that the blood on his uniform is not his and he is not really shot. next, charley participates in the battle of gettysburg. here he has the protection of rocks and logs and a large force of artillery behind him. most of the charging rebel soldiers are killed in the lines as they attack, but some eventually get close. the officers realize this danger, and send the only unit still in relative shelter, the first minnesota volunteers. they rush at the soldiers, killing them as they go hacking and shooting each other. charley eventually succumbs to the hits of the rebels, got spun and then knocked out. he saw a red veil come down his eyes and claims that at last he died. charley is 21 now. charley claims he had become so old at heart, and waited death, for it was his only escape. he knows too much and the violent killings numbed him. he says that he should be studying marriage and raising young ones, but it wouldn't be that way for him. he's tired and broken, walking with a cane and passing blood, knowing it would be near over for him. in some ways it made him sad and he was near glad of it. there was so much men that he knew that was there already, and knew it was only a matter of time. he wants to go see them to get rid of this constant pain and sounds he could not stop hearing. he limped to have a picnic near the river, and took out roast beef a jug of cold coffee, that he's used to drinking coffee that made his stomach knot. the army taught him to thrive on coffee. he can still sit to a small meal and not feel starved at all. he then admires a confederate's pistol. everybody wanted one, and asked charley to get them some, he imagines committing suicide with it. he takes out cheese and bread and admires the river, thinking of all the pretty things. later in the author's note, it is noted that in the battle of gettysburg only forty-seven men were left standing of the original thousand soldiers in minnesota's first volunteers. charley was not one of them. he was hit severely, and got patched up as best they can. he fought at later actions, but his wounds did not heal properly, nor his mental anguish. the war finished and he tried to hold jobs, but he couldn't. he went running for county clerk based on his war record. he was elected, but before he could serve, his wounds and the stress took him and he died in december 1868; he was only twenty-three years old. ... ||| 7 ||| 0

at the beginning of lady friday, a cleaner tells leaf that everybody has become infatuated with a "dr. friday", because she is so beautiful and refined; as a result, every member of the staff calls her lady friday. lady friday, a denizen and trustee of the house, is in command of the middle house. it is later revealed that lady friday has kidnapped thousands of people and taken them to avraxyn, the world that is mentioned in sir thursday as the world from which the skinless boy's mind-controlling mould originated. there, lady friday drains from them their emotions and memories, which she then drinks in order to experience them (being a house denizen herself, she cannot have these emotions herself, but must take them from others). arthur, the piper, and superior saturday all receive messages from lady friday, saying she has abdicated the rule of the middle house and that the first of the three who can reach her scriptorium in the middle house can claim the fifth key and her domain as their own. along with each message is sent a transfer plate that sends whoever touches it straight to the middle house (which is a giant, terraced mountain). arthur accidentally takes the plate and is sent to the middle house; he still retains the fourth key. while the piper is contemplating what to do with his plate, the piper's children suzy turquoise blue and fred initial numbers gold, along with their loyal new nithling bodyguard ugham, grab it and are transferred to the middle house. in the middle house, arthur takes refuge in a manuscript-gilding workshop, where he fights off some fetchers and eventually meets fred and suzy. at first, he does not trust them, fearing their allegiance to the piper; however, they and his own inclinations convince him that they can be trusted. around their necks are bindings that bend them to the piper's will; these are removed by arthur with the power of the fourth key, at suzy's behest. while on the way to the scriptorium, they meet some of the middle house's winged servants of the night, who are fighting several of saturday's elite forces, known as artful loungers. arthur singlehandedly defeats four of the latter, earning the friendship of the servants. while flying to the pinnacle of the mountain, on which stands the scriptorium, arthur is guided to the fifth part of the will, which is chained within the lair of the winged servants. this part of the will (shown on the british cover), a bizarre creature having the head of a fox, the upper torso of a bat, the lower body of a blue dragon, and four legs, is much more likable than the other parts; it is stated that this part, presumed to embody the virtue of moderation, is the part without which the will has no self-control. when arthur reaches the scriptorium, he finds that the piper has apparently killed saturday's dusk. the piper orders ugham to pick up what is supposed to be the fifth key; when ugham does so, a trap from lady friday, in the form of an entrance to the void of nothing, is sprung. ugham is instantly dissolved; as the breach gets bigger, arthur decides to use the fourth key, even if it turns him into a denizen, to close the hole. one key alone is not sufficient to accomplish this task; therefore the will advises him to call upon the power of the remaining keys in his possession; the keys appear with him, and he fixes the breach. to return to the lower house, arthur uses the improbable stair, the architect's own personal transport, to transport himself, suzy, and fred to monday's dayroom. there, the butler sneezer uses the seven dials to transport suzy, fred, arthur, and their friend dr. scamandros to friday's hideout. they find that friday has lost her self-control and is about to "experience" thousands of people at once. arthur arrives just as friday transfers their beings into the key; having obtained mastery of the middle house, he returns their experiences. he finds that his friend leaf was among the people, but that his own mother is not. it is confirmed thereafter that arthur's mother is not in the secondary realms, and is therefore deduced to be in the upper house. arthur gives all the keys to the will, except for the fifth, and decides to go to earth to settle matters there before going after saturday. as the book closes, suzy gives arthur a note that ugham gave her before he died. it appears to be a piece of a letter sent from sunday to saturday or vice versa. it reads "for the last time, i do not wish to intervene. manage affairs in the house as you wish. it will make little difference in the end. s". the sender of this message, 's', is presumed to be either saturday or sunday and is later revealed to be sunday in superior saturday. the final sentence may remind readers of the suggestion raised in sir thursday by dame primus that the trustees are wittingly or unwittingly part of a plan to destroy the house, and itself makes the suggestion that the sender believes the house to be doomed. ||| 0 ||| 2
when a military satellite returns to earth, a recovery team is dispatched to retrieve it; during a live radio communication with their base, the team members suddenly die. aerial surveillance reveals that everyone in piedmont, arizona, the town closest to where the satellite landed, is apparently dead. the base commander suspects the satellite returned with an extraterrestrial organism and recommends activating wildfire, the government-sponsored team that counters extraterrestrial biological infestation. the wildfire scientific team studying the unknown strain is composed of dr. jeremy stone, bacteriologist specialist; dr. peter leavitt, disease pathology; dr. charles burton, infection vectors specialist; and dr. mark hall, m.d., surgeon, biochemistry and ph specialist. hall is the "odd man", since he is the only one without a spouse. the robertson odd man hypothesis states that unmarried men are capable of carrying out the best, most dispassionate decisions during crises and he is given the only key that can disarm the self-destruct mechanism. a fifth scientist, dr. christian kirke, anthropologist and electrolytes specialist, was unavailable for duty because of appendicitis. the scientists believe the satellite, which was actually designed to capture upper-atmosphere microorganisms for bio-weapon exploitation, returned with a deadly microorganism that kills by nearly instantaneous disseminated intravascular coagulation (lethal blood clotting). upon investigating the town, the wildfire team discovers that the residents either died in mid-stride or went "quietly nuts" and committed bizarre suicides. two piedmont inhabitants, the sick, sterno-addicted, geriatric peter jackson; and the constantly bawling infant, jamie ritter, are biologic opposites who somehow survived the organism. the man, infant, and satellite are taken to the secret underground wildfire laboratory, a secure facility equipped with every known capacity for protection against a biological element escaping into the atmosphere, including a nuclear weapon to incinerate the facility if necessary. wildfire is hidden in a remote area near the fictional town of flatrock, nevada, sixty miles from las vegas using a sort of purloined letter approach, by locating it in the sub-basements of a legitimate department of agriculture research station. further investigation determines that the bizarre deaths were caused by a crystal-structured, extraterrestrial microbe on a meteor that crashed into the satellite, knocking it from orbit. the microbe contains chemical elements required for terrestrial life and appears to have a crystalline structure, but lacks dna, rna, proteins, and amino acids, yet it directly transforms matter to energy and vice versa. the microbe, code named "andromeda", mutates with each growth cycle, changing its biologic properties. the scientists learn that andromeda grows only within a narrow ph range; in a too-acid or too-basic growth medium, it will not multiply&nbsp;&mdash; andromeda's ph range is 7.39–7.43, like that of human blood. that is why jackson and ritter survived: both had abnormal blood ph. however, by the time the scientists realize that, andromeda's current mutation degrades the plastic shield and escapes its containment. trapped in an andromeda-contaminated laboratory, dr. burton demands that stone inject him with kalocin ("the universal antibiotic"); stone refuses, arguing it would render burton too vulnerable to infection by other harmful bacteria. burton survives because andromeda has already mutated to nonlethal form. the mutated andromeda attacks the neoprene door and hatch seals within the wildfire complex, racing to the upper levels and the surface. the self-destruct atomic bomb is automatically armed when it detects a containment breach, triggering its detonation countdown to incinerate all exo-biological diseases. as the bomb arms, the scientists realize that given andromeda's ability to generate matter directly from energy, the organism would feed, reproduce, and ultimately benefit from an atomic explosion. to halt the atomic detonation, dr. hall must insert his special key to an emergency substation anywhere in wildfire. unfortunately, he is trapped in a section with no substation. he must navigate wildfire's obstacle course of automatic defenses to reach a working substation on an upper level. he barely disarms the bomb in time before all the air is evacuated from the deepest level of the wildfire complex. andromeda eventually mutates to a benign form and is suspected to have migrated to the upper atmosphere, where the oxygen content is lower, better suiting andromeda's growth. the novel's epilogue reveals that a manned spacecraft, andros v, was incinerated during atmospheric re-entry, presumably because andromeda strain ate the plastic heat shield of andros v and caused it to burn up. ||| 6 ||| 5
the novel begins in the present tense at a point approximately midway into the novel's subsequent narrative. from the point of view of captain francis crozier, the opening chapter deals with the captain's attempts to force a seaman, who is too scared to venture into the lower decks, to follow orders. crozier muses on the fate of the expedition and how hms terror and hms erebus have been trapped in sea ice, about 28 miles north-northwest of king william island, for over a year. the weather has been much colder than normal, the tinned provisions are dwindling and often putrid and the sea ice and landmasses are mysteriously devoid of any wildlife that can be hunted. in addition to the natural dangers of the intense cold, disease and impending starvation, the crews face the horror of being randomly attacked by a monster on the ice. resembling a huge polar bear, the creature is later revealed as a mythological eskimo demon called the ‘tuunbaq’. the writer, perhaps on purpose, only hints at the supernatural qualities of the beast. simmons’ narrative frequently switches between past and present tense, to points in the story ranging from several years before the expedition to several years after, and the alternating point of view of different characters in each chapter. the fictional diary of dr harry goodsir is a literary device that is also used by the writer. for instance, a diary entry describes how sir john franklin orders a number of exploration parties to set out in various directions across the ice. these are all doomed to failure. however, goodsir’s party finds a mysterious eskimo girl (they accidentally shoot and kill her aged companion). on their return to the ships, crozier names the girl ‘lady silence’ as her tongue has been ripped out in the past. following the death of sir john franklin at the hands of the monster on the ice, captain francis crozier becomes the expedition commander with captain james fitzjames as his 2nd in command. the two men attempt to deal with the threats of the monster, disease and starvation. the friendship of the two officers, from very different social backgrounds, is touchingly described by the writer. simmons goes into great detail describing an ill-fated ‘morale boosting’ new year's eve carnivale masque, during which a large number of the expedition, including three of the four surgeons, are killed by the tuunbaq and royal marine friendly fire. crozier lays the blame for this disaster on caulker’s mate cornelius hickey and two other men. they are punished with 50 lashes of the cat each. the narrative makes it clear that their existing mutinous feelings are exacerbated by this treatment, setting the scene for the later troubles that the expedition leadership have with hickey and his compatriots. the novel changes from a ship bound tale when hms erebus is eventually crushed by the ice and its crew decamp to hms terror for a short time until all of the expedition survivors are forced to move to what is named ‘terror camp’—a tented refuge that they create on king william island. it is here that crozier and fitzjames decide that they will attempt to escape by hauling the small boats of both ships south to the canadian mainland and then down back's river to an outpost on great slave lake, an arduous journey of many hundreds of miles. sealing the doom of the crew by removing any possibility of help from the native population, simmons describes the brutal murder of lt irving by cornelius hickey. the murder is blamed on a band of eskimo hunters that irving had, in fact, befriended. the eskimo are massacred in a later revenge attack by men of the expedition. from this point on in the novel the native population is feared and avoided by the crew rather than sought. the narrative now goes into highly descriptive detail of the men’s painful efforts to haul the boats across the sea ice and frozen gravel of king william island. many men die from disease, including captain fitzjames whose demise is described by simmons in horrifying detail. there are rumblings of mutiny from cornelius hickey and his growing entourage and the tuunbaq appears with deadly frequency. the survivors eventually reach a position on the southern shore of king william island that they name ‘rescue camp’. the novel concludes with mutiny, double cross, cannibalism, and the splitting of the survivors into several groups—all of which meet grisly ends. captain francis crozier is the only survivor of the expedition and the last chapters of the novel describe how he becomes the lover of lady silence and joins her in her mystical role connected to the tuunbaq. ||| 6 ||| 5

the iron man arrived from seemingly nowhere and his appearance is described in detail. to survive, he feeds off local farm equipment. when the farm hands discover their destroyed tractors and diggers, a trap is set consisting of a covered pit on which a tractor is set as bait. hogarth, a local boy, lures the iron man to the trap. the plan succeeds, and the iron man is buried alive. the next spring, the iron man digs himself free of the pit. to keep him out of the way, the boy hogarth takes charge and brings the iron man to a metal scrap-heap to feast. the iron man promises to not cause further trouble for the locals, as long as no one troubles him. time passes, and the iron man is treated as merely another member of the community. however, astronomers monitoring the sky make a frightening new discovery; an enormous space-being moving from orbit to land on earth. the creature (soon dubbed the "space-bat-angel-dragon") crashes heavily on australia and demands that humanity provide him with food. terrified, humans send their armies to destroy the dragon, but it remains unharmed. when the iron man hears of this global threat, he allows himself to be disassembled and transported to australia where he challenges the creature to a contest of strength. if the iron man can withstand the heat of burning petroleum for longer than the space being can withstand the heat of the sun, the creature must obey the iron man's commands forever more; if the iron man melts or is afraid of melting before the space being undergoes or fears pain in the sun, the creature has permission to devour the whole earth. after playing the game two rounds, the dragon is so badly burned that he no longer appears physically frightening. the iron man by contrast has only a deformed ear-lobe to show for his pains. the alien creature admits defeat. when asked why he came to earth, the alien reveals that he is a peaceful "star spirit" who experienced excitement about the ongoing sights and sounds produced by the violent warfare of humanity. in his own life, he was a singer of the "music of the spheres"; the harmony of his kind that keeps the cosmos in balance in stable equilibrium. the iron man orders the star spirit to sing to the inhabitants of earth, flying just behind the sunset, to help soothe humanity toward a sense of peace. the beauty of his music distracts the population from its egocentricism and tendency to fight, causing the first worldwide lasting peace. ||| 2 ||| 2

on abarrach, xar is attempting to learn the secret of necromancy, but he needs a corpse to test it on. he interrogates the lazar kleitus about the location of any living sartan, and kleitus reveals that haplo lied to xar about all the sartan dying at the hands of the dead; balthazar and his group remain living. kleitus drops a hint about the seventh gate, and reveals that it's where the sundering took place and that haplo's corpse would know its location. xar dismisses this idea, as well as the lazar, and is quickly becoming obsessed with the seventh gate when receives word that two sartan have been captured: zifnab, for one, whose pleas on haplo's behalf go unheeded; and, as quite a prize, samah, ruler of the council of seven. xar is initially excited since samah is the very person who would know the seventh gate's location, and he interrogates samah for it to no avail. sang-drax&mdash; the one who actually captured samah and zifnab&mdash; is summoned by xar to mentally torture samah to death; even before he dies, samah does not reveal anything useful. xar succeeds in turning him into a far-more-complacent lazar, but too much of samah's will remains, and he still won't talk. even worse, when xar turns his back to investigate zifnab's disappearance, jonathan walks in and teaches samah how to let go; the leader of the council of seven is now well and truly dead. xar is soon told by sang-drax of haplo's "treachery"; he has helped the mensch start the kicksey-winsey and given control of arianus over to the mensch, instead of reserving it for xar himself. party to this conversation is the loyal servant who informed xar of the capture and has already been ordered to investigate the arianus situation: marit, the woman haplo loved, the mother of his child. xar marries her in traditional patryn fashion of rune-joining, both to ensure her loyalty and because it gives them an unblockable way to communicate, and then orders her to kill haplo. haplo rests on arianus and tries to heal his heart-rune, a job that truly needs two people (most rune-healing is accomplished by "circling" and allowing strength from one person to flow to the other.) prince rees'ahn and king stephen's deputy, the wizard trian, have come to drevlin to talk with high froman limbeck bolttightener in the hopes of hammering out some sort of true alliance between all three races of mensch (the mysteriarchs having folded into the human race after their leader sinistrad's death.) haplo gives the kenkari book to limbeck, and the three races together reactivate the kicksey-winsey, which realigns the scattered islands of arianus and starts a constant flow of water through the sky. then haplo enters his dragonship and prepares to leave for the last time. hugh, under contract to kill haplo, retraces his own steps. he goes from the cathedral of the albedo back to the fortress of the brotherhood, where ciang gives him a cursed knife: ugly, badly made, capable of self-movement... and covered in sartan runes. it is the only weapon the brotherhood has that might even possibly be capable of killing haplo. as payment for it, ciang orders him to never return or further payment will be taken in his blood. hugh, in the end, doesn't even use his new cursed blade&mdash; its main advantage, suppressing haplo's warning runes and a good amount of his magic, allows hugh to sneak up on him in his ship and capture him, but the tables turn and hugh accidentally ends up with haplo's knife in his gut... only to lurch back from the grave, alfred's necromancy rune having evidently condemned him to eternal life. haplo circles with hugh to calm the human's distress at returning from the dead yet again, and the two begin to plan how to find alfred when they are interrupted. marit appears and fights both haplo and hugh. the first time they engage their patryn rune-magic, however, the cursed blade reacts, transmuting itself into various threats, and the three break off their conflict periodically to quiet it down (they can't really make it stop;) they also struggle over the ship's steering-stone. eventually haplo takes the ship to chelestra, hoping to douse the cursed blade in seawater, but the knife, instead of transforming into another weapon or creature, summons a dragon-snake that destroys the ship. as haplo drifts in the sea, he hears a voice and looks up to see... alfred. at sang-drax's misleading suggestion, xar has gone to pryan with the pretext of taming the tytans, and he is frustrated with his inability to reach marit. his real reason for being there is his hope of finding the seventh gate in the citadel that haplo visited, but he finds little to encourage him. the five mensch&mdash; paithan, rega, aleatha, roland, and drugar&mdash; aren't much help, nor is zifnab, who has somehow gotten here after escaping from abarrach. shortly after xar and zifnab have arrived, sang-drax says he knows now that zifnab is "one of them;" after a battle with zifnab's dragon, he takes on xar's form and steals the ship, claiming that he will search for haplo while xar is on pryan. it is revealed during xar's stay that zifnab is actually one of the dissenting sartan who refused to go along with samah's plan; he was among the mensch on earth during the sundering, and was the first of either race to escape the labyrinth. it was he who penned many of the books xar educated himself with. (with all that zifnab has seen, his total dementia seems a bit more understandable.) xar decides to leave pryan in a ship he spotted outside the citadel, covered in sartan runes, but to do that he needs to get past the tytans. he decides to need to kill off the mensch and revive them with necromancy to serve as distractions. the mensch are having their own problems. paithan is obsessed with a room in the center of the citadel that he calls the star chamber, a room with seven huge seats and an apparatus that generates blinding light. roland and aleatha are mostly not on speaking terms; the elf maiden finds herself spending more time with drugar, who may be the last of his race. but drugar has discovered a delightful illusion: at a certain clearing in the garden maze, at certain times of the day, he can see ghostly shadows of people from all the mensch races, walking around and talking to each other. aleatha is there when he uses his amulet to activate the platform, teleporting him instantly to a different citadel&mdash; where, as it turns out, there are other survivors. marit finds herself in a sartan prison. on a bench in the middle of the room, haplo recovers from injuries caused by the cursed blade. across from it, hugh the hand and the dog watch her with unblinking eyes. their "jailer": none other than alfred, who rescued them from chelestra. after some discussion, haplo realizes that they are in the vortex, the one-way gate at the very center of the labyrinth. it was here that the patryns were initially imprisoned and chose to live for generations, until people calling themselves nexus runners started trying to escape. (it's unknown when they abandoned the vortex and all moved out into the labyrinth.) haplo decides to enter the labyrinth in search of his daughter, whom marit named rue. hugh agrees to go with him, as does marit at xar's command; he has told marit to hold off on killing haplo to report back any conversations alfred and haplo have about the other worlds. it is only alfred who balks. he has nothing left&mdash; orla "saw" samah's death and chose a peaceful death to be with him&mdash; but fear of the unknown. the labyrinth itself, however, refuses to let him return to the vortex by unceremoniously dropping a mountain on top of the exit back into it. to haplo, the labyrinth seems afraid of alfred, though he can't for the life of him figure out why; what is alfred, besides a bumbling, useless sartan? ...who can turn into a dragon and bring people back from the dead? the group is about to be overrun by tiger-men when, surprisingly, a patryn raiding party comes to save them. this party comes from abri, the one and only city inside the labyrinth (anathema to the lone-wolf patryns). while camping overnight, alfred admits his true name to haplo: coren, a sartan word that can mean "to choose" or perhaps "chosen." many sartan children were named that, in hopes of a self-fulfilling prophecy, but (as haplo points out) alfred did not feel particularly amused when he awoke, the last living sartan on arianus. clearly alfred was coren, was chosen&mdash;but for what? marit, however, betrays them by revealing that alfred is a sartan. haplo, hugh, and alfred are jailed by the city's leader, headman vasu, to await lord xar&mdash; marit accused haplo of being a traitor and plotting against their people&mdash; but are freed again just as quickly after marit overhears the disguised sang-drax plotting to kill them. sang-drax and his cronies are also gathering a huge army of the labyrinth's native monsters, with which to destroy the city of abri and seal the final gate; they allowed marit to overhear them to feed off the emotions that would come from it. abri's occupants prepare for its defense, while haplo and marit, prodded by the dog, finally find their love for each other. alfred feels out of place; though few seem to begrudge him his sartan heritage, he is still out-of-place here, a clumsy pacifist in a city preparing for war. talking with headman vasu, however, he eventually discovers that the city was not made by patryns (who do not build cities,) or at least not by patryns alone&mdash; the sartan "heretics" who were expelled into the labyrinth were accepted by the patryns, eventually integrating completely into the society; vasu himself is half-and-half, supplementing his patryn tattoos with sartan magic. the patryns taught them the value of family; the sartan, in return, taught the patryns the value of banding together. here, at the heart of the labyrinth, rises abri, the city that symbolizes the best in both cultures. alfred also finds out why he is called the serpent mage: it is a title from a sartan hierarchy of strength in magic, whose levels are named after animals. serpent is very near the top. alfred has found the meaning of his name: to choose his power, and all the responsibility it comes with... or to choose alfred, who would rather faint than have to use his magic. back on pryan, drugar returns from the other citadel with knowledge: he knows how to stop the tytans. aleatha has fled the maze, though; pushed into hysterics by his sudden (and literal) disappearance, she ran back to her brother, and the four are now at a "party" of xar's, at which he hopes to kill them with poisoned wine so that their bodies will be undamaged. zifnab, however, saves them by drinking all of it himself and saying that it was poisoned, faking his death once again. the mensch are horrified at the revelation that xar means to kill them. aleatha escapes the room, while the other three are sealed inside by xar... until zifnab's dragon discovers zifnab's "death" and tears the room apart. aleatha has fled once again into the maze, where xar can't pursue her because of protective sartan runes covering its path. she runs into drugar and he tells her they have to let the tytans inside to help them; he shares with her how to stop them. they run for the gates, but before they can reach it, xar attacks; drugar sacrifices himself to save aleatha. xar is about to kill aleatha when the dragon strikes, distracting xar with battling it instead of killing mensch. the other mensch have escaped from the destroyed room and find her, and they think she's mad when she tells them what she's going to do. she uses the amulet to open the gate and invites the tytans inside; they peacefully enter and ask, &mdash;where is the citadel? to which aleatha answers, "here is the citadel. you are home." xar recovers from his battle with the dragon, and prepares to leave for the labyrinth after marit reports back to him&mdash; apparently corrupted by haplo's influence into thinking xar has made a mistake in allying with the dragon-snakes, as she says they are planning an attack. he is surprised when the tytans don't kill the mensch, and actually act to protect the mensch from him, but he avoids a fight by snatching drugar's amulet from aleatha and running away with it. the amulet will gain him entry into the sartan ship, which he can then use to return to the labyrinth. at abri, the battle between patryns and labyrinth creatures rages fiercely, but the real threat comes from the dragon-snakes. haplo, marit, and hugh lead a sortie to deal with them, and the three battle sang-drax in his serpent form. sang-drax is apparently killed by haplo, but haplo has been badly injured and almost crushed beneath the massive body. marit is attacked by a wolfen when a green and golden dragon carries it away: alfred, having made his choice to accept his power. he lifts the serpent's body off of haplo, leaving marit to hold his blood-soaked form, his heart-rune's wound having reopened. but while alfred is distracted in battle with the dragon-snakes, xar appears. he wants haplo's knowledge of the chamber of the damned, and will stop at nothing to get it. the battle ends with the labyrinth's armies driven off, but marit dazed and wounded, haplo abducted by xar, and alfred missing in action. ||| 2 ||| 2
the main plotline is a project by aliens who inhabit a parallel universe (the para-universe) with different physical laws from this one. by exchanging matter with earth, they seek to exploit these differences in physical laws. the exchange of matter provides an alternative source of energy in their dying universe. however, the exchange of physical laws will have the ultimate result of turning the earth's sun into a supernova, and possibly even turning a large part of the milky way into a quasar which, in turn, provides more energy for the para-universe. the first part takes place on earth. frederick hallam, a scientist of limited ability but with a fiercely protective ego, discovers that an old container's contents seem to have been altered. he initially accuses a colleague of tampering with his sample, and gets a snide remark in return. hallam responds with a furious effort and eventually finds that the sample, originally tungsten, has been transformed into something that turns out to be plutonium 186—an isotope that cannot occur naturally in our universe. as this is investigated, hallam makes the crucial suggestion that the matter has been swapped by beings in a parallel universe. this turns out to be correct and leads to the development of a cheap, clean, and apparently endless source of energy: the "electron pump", which trades matter between our universe (where plutonium 186 decays into tungsten 186) and a parallel one governed by slightly different physical laws (where tungsten 186 turns into plutonium 186), yielding a nuclear reaction in the process. the development process inextricably ties hallam to the pump in the minds of the people, vaulting him into an incredibly high position in public opinion and winning him power, position, and a nobel prize to boot. an idealistic young physicist, lamont, while writing a history of the pump, comes into conflict with hallam and begins to question the official history of its discovery. lamont is convinced that the development of the pump was mainly due to the "para-men", who he believes are more intelligent; he notes the instructions they had sent early in the project (although only the diagrams, and not the linguistic parts, had been comprehensible). hallam is infuriated by the suggestion that his role is secondary, and destroys lamont's career. lamont enlists the help of bronowski, a linguist who had won renown for translating the etruscan language and is looking for a new challenge. as bronowski works on the para-men's old messages, lamont discovers that the pump is in fact creating a dangerous situation that could cause the sun to become a nova (the pump increases the strong nuclear force inside the sun, causing the sun to fuse its hydrogen fuel more rapidly). this would, incidentally, also doom the para-world by accelerating the cooling of its own sun. bronowski seems to be making some progress, receiving what appears to be an acknowledgment that the pump may be dangerous. lamont attempts to demonstrate this to a politician and several members of the scientific community, but they, seduced by the cheap, presumed clean energy source and unwilling to take hallam on face-to-face for fear of suffering lamont's own fate, are unwilling to listen to him. lamont decides that the only option now is to tell the para-men that the earth-side agrees to stop, arguing that even if he is killed for it, he will eventually be a hero who saved the world. but then bronowski reveals his last message which shows that they have in fact been in contact not with the para-authorities but with para-dissidents like himself, who cannot persuade their para-hallam, and are therefore - in a mirror-image way - begging him to stop the pump. there seems to be no way out. the second part takes place in the parallel universe. the aliens consist of the "hard ones" and the amorphous "soft ones". the soft ones have three sexes with fixed roles for each sex: * rationals - called "lefts", rationals are the logical and scientific sex. rationals are identified with masculine pronouns and produce a form of sperm. * emotionals - called "mids", emotionals are the intuitive sex. emotionals are identified with the feminine pronouns and provide the energy needed for reproduction. * parentals - called "rights", parentals bear and raise the offspring. parentals are identified with masculine pronouns. all three 'genders' are embedded in sexual and social norms of expected and acceptable behavior. the hard ones regulate much of soft one society, among other things creating families by allocating one of each of the sexes to a mating group, or "triad" in the novel's terminology, and acting as teachers and mentors to the rationals. little is shown of "hard one" society and dua, the protagonist of this section of the book, suspects that the "hard ones" are a dying race since there are no "hard one" children. her assumption is that the "hard ones" keep the "soft ones" as pets and toys, as a replacement for the children they do not have. this is dismissed by odeen, the rational of dua's triad, who having the most contact with the "hard ones", has heard the "hard ones" speak of a new "hard one" called "estwald". dua is an oddball emotional who exhibits traits normally associated with rationals, leading her to be called a "left-em". interestingly, the companions in her triad are also revealed to be unusual and they too behave differently than what is expected from their appropriate sex. she learns about her universe's end of the pump. by engaging in teachings from odeen, she also concludes on her own the supernova problem that lamont uncovered in the first section; outraged that the pump is allowed to continue to operate, despite the fact that it will eventually result in the destruction of another civilization, she attempts to put a stop to the project. she cannot persuade her own species to abandon the pump, as they have no choice but to use it - their own sun as well as all the other stars in that universe are dying and can no longer provide the energy they need to continue to reproduce; their only other source of energy is the pump. the majority decision is that, while their continued use of the pump will destroy earth and its solar system, abandoning it will result in their own extinction and thus cannot be done. while lamont has assumed the destruction of earth's sun would be fatal for the para-world, it turns out that in fact they would be able to draw energy off such a huge source directly without needing a pump any more, and thus they would actually be safer once the earth sun exploded. the differences in the laws of physics in the parallel universe mean that the aliens' bodies do not have the same material properties as living matter in this universe. instead of consuming material that is then converted into energy, the aliens absorb it directly from sunlight. the different sexes can "melt" and merge physically, their analog of sex (the younger ones and some emotionals can somehow overcome the repulsion between atoms and melt into walls, which is seen as a social taboo). rationals and parentals can do this to some extent independently, but in the presence of an emotional, they can become essentially immaterial and the "melt" becomes total, the three bodies coming together into one (which causes orgasmic sensations, but also results in blackout and memory loss during the "melt"). only during such a total "melt" can the rational "impregnate" the parental, with the emotional providing the energy. driven by an innate desire to procreate, tritt, the "parental" of the triad, at first asks odeen to persuade dua to facilitate the production of the third child. when this fails, tritt steals an energy-battery from the pump and rigs it to feed dua. she accepts it, as it coincides with her finally being taught by odeen about physics (which violates the gender norms of this society - odeen consulted his hard-teacher about the problem of the third child, the teacher encouraged him to go with her abnormalities). filled with this energy, the triad mates, and tritt becomes pregnant with their last child. dua discovers this betrayal and escapes from her family to the caves of the hard ones where she is able to melt through the walls (which is possible because she retained her thinness by eating little in general). once there she begins a guerilla campaign to stop the pump, transmitting the alternative messages that lamont received in the first section. eventually, her escape method of melting through walls and creating the metal messages cause her to lose too much of the energy needed to continue her existence. as she is about to expire, against all odds she is found by her triad. she is about to defy her triad by seeking to die anyway, but it is finally revealed that once a triad has produced at least one more triad of children to maintain a stable population, they are ready to fuse permanently into a single individual of the species's fully mature form - the hard ones. in fact, they temporarily form this same individual whenever they melt, but have no memory of it afterward. this fact is kept carefully concealed by the mature population from the semi-mature population, because the melt is also a mind-meld, and it is important that the rational of a triad become mature enough to understand the conditions of their existence by themselves, before the final melt into a mature hard one. afraid that they will lose the hard one formed by dua's triad, the hard ones have coached odeen into realising the reality of the melt. all members of the triad are exceptional in their own way; dua has learnt more about the other universe than any hard one, odeen has shown greater intuition and empathy than a normal rational, and tritt has shown greater initiative and technical ability in stealing and setting up the lamp than any other right. odeen convinces dua that the hard one that they will become will have influence with the hard ones to stop the pump. as they are ready to "pass on", in between thoughts of the daughter she will not know, dua realizes that in fact the fusion of her triad had produced estwald himself, the original inventor of the pump. the third part of the novel takes place on the moon, centering around a cynical middle-aged physicist named denison, briefly introduced in part 1 as the colleague and rival of hallam whose snide remark drove hallam to invent the pump. denison, independently of lamont, deduced the danger in the electron pump (although it was lamont who discovered the final technical facts), and goes on to find a solution that harms no one and greatly benefits humanity: he taps into yet another parallel universe, that exists in a pre-big bang state (a cosmic egg or cosmeg), where physical laws are different and, in fact, opposite to the ones in dua's universe. the exchange with the second parallel universe both produces more energy at little or no cost (which is a pleasant side effect for the lunar residents, who had been unable to establish electron pumps), and balances out the changes from the use of the electron pump, resulting in a return to equilibrium. denison is helped by a lunarian tourist guide named selene lindstrom, who is secretly an intuitionist (a genetically engineered human with superhuman intuition). in the end, selene and denison also foil a plot to use the new power source to move the moon out of earth orbit. ||| 2 ||| 5
moscow, 1925. while foraging for trash one winter day, a stray dog is found by a cook and scalded with boiling water. lying forlorn in a doorway, the dog awaits his end awash in thoughts of self-pity. to his surprise, successful surgeon filip filippovich preobrazhensky arrives and offers the dog a piece of sausage. overjoyed, the dog follows filip back to his flat, where he is given the stock dog name, sharik. at the house, sharik gets to know dr. preobrazhensky's household, which includes the medical student bormental and two female servants. despite the professor's blatant anti-communism, his frequent medical treatment of the cpsu leadership makes him untouchable. as a result, he refuses to decrease his seven room flat and treats the bolsheviks on the housing committee, led by shvonder, with unveiled contempt. impressed by his new master, sharik slips easily into the role of "a gentleman's dog." after several days, one of the servants begins taking sharik for walks through moscow. preening in his new collar, sharik is unmoved by the taunts of a passing stray. after his health improves, the professor at last reveals his real intentions in taking in sharik. as the laboratory is prepped, he orders sharik locked in the bathroom. as a seething sharik plots to again destroy the professor's stuffed owl, the door opens and he is dragged by the scruff of the neck into the lab. there, he is sedated and an operation begins. as bormental assists, the professor trepans sharik's skull and gives him a human pituitary gland. sharik's torso is also opened and he is given human testicles. only repeated injections of adrenaline prevent the dog from dying on the operating table. during the weeks after the operation, the household is stunned as sharik begins transforming into an incredibly unkempt human. after building an alliance with shvonder, the former canine is granted papers under the absurd name "poligraf poligrafovich sharikov." in the aftermath, the professor and bormental patiently attempt to teach sharikov basic ettiquette. instead, sharikov mocks the idea of manners as relics of tsarism. he insists that it is better to behave, as he puts it, "naturally." as a result, sharikov curses in front of women, refuses to shave, and dresses like a complete slob. meawhile, sharikov progressively turns the professor's life into a living hell. one day, he accidentally turns on the spigot while chasing a cat. with the bathroom door locked, the entire apartment is flooded. later, he is caught attempting to rape one of the female servants. enraged, bormental beats sharikov up and forces him to apologize. infuriated, sharikov leaves the apartment and remains gone for several days. later, bormental begs the professor for permission to dose sharikov with arsenic, calling him a man with "the heart of a dog." the professor is horrified and orders bormental not to "slander the dog." he explains that the human body parts, which came from a drunken proletarian, are responsible for all of sharikov's defects. bormental then suggests that they redo the operation, using the body of a genius. again the professor refuses, explaining that the operation was meant to improve the human race. breaking with his former beliefs, the professor admits that any peasant woman could give birth to a genius and that eugenics are therefore a waste of time. in conclusion, the professor refuses to permit sharikov's murder or to undo the operation, which could easily kill him as well. soon after, sharikov returns, explaining that he has been granted a job by the soviet state. he now spends his work-day strangling vagrant cats, whose fur is used to imitate that of squirrels. soon after sharikov brings home a female co-worker, whom he introduces to the professor as his new common law wife. instead of giving them their own room as sharikov demands, the professor takes the woman aside and explains that sharikov is the product of a lab experiment gone horribly wrong. the woman, who had believed that sharikov was a red army veteran maimed during the russian civil war, leaves the apartment in tears. seething with hatred, sharikov threatens to fire her. again bormental beats sharikov up and makes him promise not to do anything of the sort. the following day, a senior party official arrives and informs the professor that sharikov has denounced him to the secret police, or cheka. explaining that nothing is going to happen to him due to the state's distrust of sharikov, the party official departs. when sharikov returns, the professor and bormental order him to leave the flat permanently. instead, sharikov refuses and draws a revolver. enraged, the professor and bormental pounce upon him. that night, an ominous silence reigns in the flat and the lights are left on for many hours after bedtime. over the days that follow, the professor and bormental look far more relaxed than at any time before sharikov's arrival. eventually, the police arrive escorted by shvonder. bearing a search warrant, they demand to see sharikov on pain of arresting the professor and bormental. unintimidated, the professor orders bormental to summon sharikov, who is slowly being transformed back into a dog. the professor explains the change as a natural phenomenon, although it is obvious to the reader that in fact he and bormental have simply performed the reverse operation. followed by the now apoplectic shvonder, the police depart. in the aftermath, the fully canine sharik blissfully resumes his status as a gentleman's dog. however, he is soon terrified to see the professor bringing home a human brain and removing the pituitary gland... ||| 5 ||| 2
shimmer, an exiled dragon princess traveling incognito in human form, senses powerful magic emanating from a small village. investigating its source, she determines that it is the witch civet, who sealed up the waters of her homeland, the inland sea, centuries ago in the form of a blue pebble, now making it known as the lost sea. civet is staying at a local inn in disguise. shimmer soon encounters a young, orphaned kitchen servant named thorn who is being harassed by the local children because he claims to have seen the mythical unicorn, one of the five masters. supporting him, shimmer is defended by thorn when the children are about to turn on her, earning a beating from his master the innkeeper. she visits thorn at the inn out of gratitude, and accepts his offer of a meal and a place to stay for the night, having never met with such hospitality during all her years of exile. later that night, she saves thorn from an attack by one of civet's servants, an enchanted paper warrior sent to kill him because of his purported unicorn sighting. the two are forced to flee the village after shimmer defends thorn against his master. to escape, shimmer uses the dream pearl, a treasure which she was exiled for supposedly stealing hundreds of years ago, to change into her true form as a dragon in order fly away with thorn. during the course of their flight, thorn resolves to stay with shimmer and help her with her quest, which she reluctantly accepts. the two fly to the forest of the keeper, a once powerful wizard known for keeping a "menagerie of monstrous pets"., where shimmer believes civet is headed. in the ruins of his former city, they encounter the keeper, who still has enough magic left to have recreated some of his pets. he reveals that civet was able to steal his mist stone, a gem which can turn its user's form into cloud. shimmer realizes that this will now make him covet her dream pearl. the keeper tries to take it, but shimmer and thorn manage to escape. pursued by the keeper and his pets for hours, shimmer manages to defeat them in an aerial battle near her former home, the lost sea, but her wing is injured and she is forced to land. she and thorn have to traverse the vast expanse of salt the lost sea has now become for a few days on foot on the trail of civet, who is bound for the city of river glen, a city the dragons of the inland sea used to trade with. at river glen, shimmer and thorn encounter monkey, a powerful mage and formerly notorious troublemaker who has been charged by his master, a wizard known as the old boy, with protecting river glen from civet. monkey welcomes shimmer and thorn, but drugs their tea, putting them to sleep to prevent them from interfering with his plan to apprehend civet singlehandedly. civet herself attempts to get into river glen in disguise, but does not fool monkey. before he can subdue her, she manages to unleash the waters of the lost sea by destroying the blue pebble, leaving river glen nearly totally submerged. civet escapes by using the mist stone that she stole from the keeper to transform herself into cloud. monkey decides to try to steal the magical cauldron, known as 'baldy's bowl', from shimmer's uncle, the high king of the dragons, to boil the waters of the lost sea away. shimmer tries to convince thorn to go with him so he can be brought to a human city, but he vows to stay with her and help her catch civet. monkey gives them one of his hairs which will turn into an unbreakable magic chain on command to help. shimmer and thorn then set off for civet's lair, the weeping mountain. at weeping mountain, they manage to fight their way past various opponents to reach a cavern where they summon civet, who manages to capture them both despite having used up a great deal of her magic by having destroyed the blue pebble. as she is about to kill shimmer, thorn is able to convince her to allow him to prepare a meal for her because all her paper servants have been destroyed. during the meal, civet reveals her past, which shimmer was previously unaware of. she was a teenager from river glen who was demanded as a bride by the king within the river, a powerful magical being who could have destroyed river glen at will. her body was preserved as it was at the time of her death by drowning to join her husband, but she resented her marriage because the king was hideous and kept her sequestered in his palace. it took her a thousand years to learn enough magic from him to be able to turn him into a stone and escape, by which time river glen had been transformed from a village into a prosperous, industrial city which had grown wealthy from its trade with the dragons of the inland sea. wanting revenge against both the dragons and river glen led civet to seal up the waters of the inland sea and use them to punish river glen. after she finishes her story, thorn manages to disable civet with monkey's hair that he had planted in her noodles, which turns into a chain that gets into her stomach. after shimmer is freed, she tries to kill civet but cannot, because her perception of her has changed, making her realize that they are both alike in that they have lost their former homes. however the spell on monkey's hair cannot be undone, leaving civet paralyzed. shimmer decides that the chain disabling civet can be removed for any help she can give in restoring the lost sea, but she will need to journey to the dragon kingdoms in search of monkey or a powerful mage. thorn is determined to go with her, after which the two acknowledge their partnership and informally "adopt" each other before setting off. ||| 2 ||| 2
the two youngest pevensie children, lucy and edmund, are staying with their odious cousin eustace scrubb while their older brother peter is studying for his university entrance exams with professor kirke, and their older sister susan is traveling through america with their parents. edmund, lucy, and eustace are drawn into the narnian world through a picture of a ship at sea. (the painting, hanging neglected in the guest bedroom that the pevensie children were using, had been an unwanted present to eustace's parents.) the three children land in the ocean near the pictured vessel, the titular dawn treader, and are taken aboard. the dawn treader is the ship of caspian x, king of narnia, who was the key character in the previous book (prince caspian). edmund and lucy (along with peter and susan) helped him gain the throne from his evil uncle miraz. three years have passed since then, peace has been established in narnia, and caspian has undertaken his oath to find the seven lost lords of narnia. lucy and edmund are delighted to be back in narnia, but eustace is less enthusiastic, as he has never been there before and had taunted his cousins with his belief that the country never existed. the talking mouse reepicheep is also on board, as he hopes to find aslan's country beyond the seas of the "utter east". they first make landfall in the lone islands, nominally narnian territory but fallen away from narnian ways: in particular the slave trade flourishes here, despite narnian law stating that it is forbidden. caspian, lucy, edmund, eustace and reepicheep are captured as merchandise by a slave trader, and a man "buys" caspian before they even reach the slave market. he turns out to be the first lost lord, lord bern, who moved to the islands and married a woman there after being banished from narnia by miraz. when caspian reveals his identity, bern acknowledges him as king. caspian reclaims the islands for narnia, and replaces gumpas, the greedy governor, with lord bern, whom he names duke of the lone islands. at the second island they visit, eustace leaves the group to avoid participating in the work needed to render the ship seaworthy after a storm has damaged it, and hides in a dead dragon's cave to escape a sudden downpour. the dragon's treasure arouses his greed: he fills his pockets with gold and jewels and puts on a large golden bracelet; but as he sleeps, he is transformed into a dragon. as a dragon, he becomes aware of how bad his previous behaviour was, and uses his strength to help make amends. caspian recognizes the bracelet: it belonged to lord octesian, another of the lost lords. they speculate that the dragon killed octesian — or even that the dragon was octesian. aslan turns eustace back into a boy, and as a result of his experiences he is now a much nicer person. they make stops at burnt island; at deathwater island (so named for a pool of water which turns everything immersed in it into gold, including one of the missing lords who turns out to have been lord restimar); at the duffers' island, where lucy herself encounters aslan; and at the island where dreams come true&nbsp;— called the dark island since it is permanently hidden in darkness. they rescue a desperate lord rhoop from this last. eventually they reach the island of the star, where they find the three remaining lost lords in enchanted sleep. ramandu, the fallen star who lives on the island, tells them that the only way to awaken them is to sail to the edge of the world and there to leave one member of the crew behind. the dawn treader continues sailing into an area where merpeople dwell and the water turns sweet rather than salty. at last the water becomes so shallow that the ship can go no farther. caspian orders a boat lowered and announces that he will go to the world's end with reepicheep. the crew object, saying that as king of narnia he has no right to abandon them. caspian goes to his cabin in a temper, but returns to say that aslan appeared in his cabin and told him that only lucy, edmund, eustace, and reepicheep will go on. these four named venture in a small boat through a sea of lilies until they reach a wall of water that extends into the sky. fulfilling ramandu's condition, reepicheep paddles his coracle up the waterfall and is never again seen in narnia (lewis hints that he reaches aslan's country). edmund, eustace, and lucy find a lamb, who transforms into aslan and tells them that edmund and lucy will not return to narnia&nbsp;– that they should learn to know him by another name in their own world. he then sends the children home. in their own world, everyone remarks on how eustace has changed and "you'd never know him for the same boy" - although his mother believes that edmund and lucy have been a bad influence on him. ||| 0 ||| 2
tempted starts immediately after the end of events in the 5th book, hunted, and is told from the point of view of six characters: zoey, stevie rae, aphrodite, rephaim, heath and stark. in the aftermath zoey gathers her allies and starts organizing them. stevie rae notices she's very tired and takes over, leaving zoey to take care of a wounded stark and her grandmother. having recovered from her accident, she tells zoey that she is a-ya's reincarnation and that a-ya was made to love kalona, so that's why she cannot help being uncontrollably attracted to kalona, as it's in her soul. in the end she's so stressed that when erik finds her, demanding a share of her time, they quarrel and she dumps him for being overly jealous and possessive, taking her down to two love interests (whilst erik forms a relationship with venus, aphrodite's ex- roommate). she rooms in with aphrodite and has a dream with kalona at the same time she has a vision that links to several elements from the dream. alerted by zoey's panic, stark climbs up to her room and sleeps there to guard her from further intrusions. aphrodite leaves and takes darius to stark's abandoned room. while they talk, she realizes she's come to love him and is afraid she is incapable of returning his feelings. he soothes her and pledges his warrior's oath to her. the kids return to the house of night. they find anastasia lankford, a professor at the house of night, dead at rephaim's hands, and dragon grieving her loss. jack stays with dragon to comfort him and coax him through his pain while zoey goes to assess the mood of the school. through aphrodite's visions, zoey's dreams of kalona and kramisha's prophetic poems they find that kalona and neferet plan on getting back the old ways of the vampyres. following the rumors on twitter, jack finds kalona and neferet in venice, on the isle of san clemente with the vampyre council. another vision brings a new warning: if zoey is with kalona the world will end as they know it, and if she chooses love and nyx he will "die" and the world will be safe. on the other hand, zoey can't completely reject him, as she believes he can be saved. in an effort to gain her favor, kalona shows her his past as nyx's warrior and promises to change his ways if she will have him. zoey and her friends go to venice to have their say in the council, but stevie rae stays behind, arguing that it's her responsibility as a high priestess to take care of the rogues. upon arriving, they learn that neferet claims to be nyx incarnate and kalona claims to be erebus. it is revealed that zoey's destiny is to face kalona alone, meaning that only she can save the world. the council declares aphrodite a prophetess of the vampyres, but is otherwise distrusting of zoey, mainly because of her age. after the council session is over heath and zoey talk about the stresses of everything going on zoey sends heath to find stark. he discovers neferet and kalona in a secret conversation; kalona finds heath. heath uses the imprint to call zoey and she arrives to see kalona kill him. in her anguish she throws spirit at kalona, but her soul shatters and goes to the otherworld. while sweeping the benedictine abbey grounds, stevie rae finds an injured raven mocker named rephaim (the favored son of kalona) and helps him to safety against her better judgement. she binds his wounds and sends him through the tunnels. back at the house of night she's horrified to learn that he was actually the one to kill dragon's mate, anastasia lankford. in the tunnels rephaim is found by the rougue red fledglings, and their leader, nicole, uses her gift to peer into his mind and learns that stevie rae saved him. they use him as bait and catch stevie rae, leaving her alongside him in a cage on the roof to be burned down by the sun. rephaim helps her and the two get in the ground at the last minute. to repay her for nursing him back to healt, he offers her his immortal blood to heal her burns. unexpectedly, the two imprint and stevie rae loses hers with aphrodite. alerted by aphrodite's going into painful convulsions, zoey calls at the house of night and erik and lenobia rush to find and save stevie rae. with the last of her powers, stevie rae hides rephaim from their eyes as they get her out. ||| 7 ||| 2

geheimnisnacht (night of secrets) the first chapter finds the adventurers shortly after meeting for the first time and leaving altdorf together. they are kicked off the coach they were riding on because of gotrek's comments toward the coach driver and especially his wife. as they continue to travel on foot, they are nearly run down by a black coach, and gotrek vows to find it and hurt the driver. they reach the standing stones inn, and are able to make their way through the barred door to learn of how on geheimnisnacht a coven who are based in the darkstone ring steal children and other people for sacrifices. they learn that the son of the innkeeper, gunter, and his wife have both disappeared, and so they vow to find the darkstone ring and destroy the coven and save gunter and his wife. after finding the path to the ring, they come across a rotting cultist who chants gibberish before being felled. they finally come across the ring and coven and discover that the leader of the coven is the driver of the black coach. they listen in for a while and learn that it is dedicated to slaanesh, lord of pleasure. they finally attack and destroy the coven as they intended to sacrifice a stolen baby, and in the aftermath they discover that gunter and his wife were both cultists, and so are both dead. they rescue the baby, and move on... this story is frequently alluded to by felix later in the series, as it was his first true glimpse at chaos. wolf riders the story begins with felix in a tavern protecting a girl from the attentions of three huge trappers: hef, kell, and lars. he holds his own until gotrek comes in and drives them out. the girl introduces herself as kirsten, and explains how her family is part of the von diehl migration, a cursed noble family and their servants and their families moving to the border lands. gotrek and felix were on their way to the dwarf stronghold of karak eight-peaks because of stories of treasure they had heard. they decide to join the von diehls, as they are heading in the same general direction, and they could use the cover afforded by carts. after traveling through the grey mountains, and reaching the border lands, felix falls deeply in love with kirsten, and she likewise. while camped in the cursed hills, the camp is attacked by undead warriors, and during the fight, felix kills the trapper lars, after he goes crazy and attacks him. the men drive off the undead, and they set off to find a ruined fort, which gotrek helps repair, hinting at his pre-slayer background as an engineer. finally, the fort is attacked by wolf riders, led by a goblin shaman, and during the first siege, gottfried, the leader of the von diehls, is struck by an arrow and is carried off by his son, deiter; his nephew, manfred; frau winter, a sorceress; and kirsten, frau winter's assistant, to be healed. after a day of no word from them, and with the second siege starting, felix goes off to investigate, leaving gotrek and the remaining men to fight off the horde ready to break through the gates. felix comes across frau winter and kirsten, the former who is dead and the latter who is dying. felix watches her die, and swears to avenge her. he then comes across dieter, whose head was bashed in, and enters gottfired's room to see him stabbed to death in his bed with manfred sitting there wiping off his blade. he then explains that the "curse" of the von diehls was mutation brought on by a heretic cursing manfred's grandfather. manfred, going mad, explains that he broke the curse by killing all of the von diehls. he and felix duel, and felix kills him, uttering "the curse is broken". he goes outside to see gotrek standing on a pile of goblin, wolf and human bodies, including hef and kell. he single-handedly held the gate, killing the shaman and losing his eye in the process. the surviving humans are taken in by one of the many border princes, whilst gotrek and felix leave, and the story ends... the dark beneath the world the story continues immediately after 'wolf riders', with felix and gotrek travelling towards karak eight peaks in search of treasure. on the way, they meet a party of men under attack from orcs. the pair intervene and save the three survivors: aldebrand, a zealous fanatic from the templars of the fiery heart, zauberlich, a sorcerer, and jules, a bretonnian scout, are also journeying to karak eight peaks on a quest. the group decide to travel together. they arrive at a settlement built by the dwarves close to the ruined city, and ask permission to enter the city, where they learn what the three men are searching for: a magical sword called karaghul, an heirloom of the order of the fiery heart, left in the city during a previous effort to reclaim part of the city by the dwarves from the goblins that infest it. the group are given leave to enter the city, but before they go, a dwarven priestess of valaya warns them that great evil is stirring in the ruins of the city... the group journey into the depths of the ruined city, battling with goblins, orcs, skaven and ogres that now infest the ruined halls. as they go deeper, they are followed by ghostly lights. eventually, the lights reveal themselves as dwarven ghosts, who beg gotrek to help them. when he asks what has happened, they say that an ancient and powerful evil has desecrated their tombs and dragged them back from their eternal rest in the hall of ancestors, and that unless it is slain and the tombs resanctified, they will never find their way back to eternal rest. gotrek vows to aid them. the group finally come to a great treasure room-the very one that felix and gotrek have been seeking. in pride of place is a great sword, which aldebrand recognizes as karaghul. however, before he can claim it, a huge creature bursts out and kills him, tearing his head from his shoulders. the creature is a great troll, tainted and corrupted by warpstone, twisted and mutated by the power of chaos that it has become something far more terrible. gotrek realizes they are in a dwarven tomb, and that the troll's presence is the reason why the ghosts are stalking the ruins of karak eight peaks. the group attack, but the troll has the ability to heal its wounds almost instantaneously, and they can only slow it. the troll kills jules and zauberlich, but not before the sorcerer learns that fire destroys the troll's ability to regenerate. as gotrek keeps the beast distracted, felix throws a lamp on it, which ignites, setting the beast on fire and letting gotrek finally kill it. a huge army of goblins arrives, attracted by the commotion. as gotrek and felix consign themselves to dying in battle, the ghosts of the tomb form up in a spectral army and attack the goblins, killing them with ease and causing the survivors to flee. gotrek angrily says that the ghosts have denied him a heroic death, but they reply he is destined for a doom far greater...that is soon approaching. the ghosts bless him for his deed and disappear, finally at peace. gotrek ignores the treasure, realizing that to take it would desecrate the tomb and raise the ghosts again, though felix takes karaghul in honour of their dead comrades. leaving the bodies of their companions at rest in the tomb, the pair seal it and leave karak eight peaks behind... the mark of slaanesh the story picks up after they have left karak eight peaks and come to a small village at the edge of the drakwald forest. the village is controlled by a gang of vicious thugs who are also cultists of slaanesh, who viciously beat up felix in the village tavern shortly after his arrival. to make matters worse, in a battle with mutants on the road, gotrek was struck on the head with a slingstone and is suffering amnesia, no longer remembering who he is, nor who felix is, or his quest to find a heroic death. felix takes gotrek to a local healer called kryptmann, who promises to create a brew to restore gotrek's mind, providing felix brings back certain ingredients from the nearby mountains. narrowly avoiding the slaaneshi thugs and a roving band of mutants, felix gathers the ingredients and brings them to kryptmann. however, the brew has no effect, and felix attacks kryptmann, accusing the healer of lying to him. in the confusion, gotrek receives another blow to the head, which restores his memory to him. with the slayer restored to his wits, the pair go to the tavern and revenge themselves on the cultists... blood and darkness the story begins with gotrek and felix passing through the drakwald forest. they find a young girl called kat, the sole survivor of a beastman attack on her village. the beastmen were led by a female chaos champion of the chaos god, khorne, who mysteriously spared kat's life. the story then switches to the perspective of the female chaos champion, a woman called justine, who turned to chaos after being raped as a young woman by a nobleman. after many years in the chaos wastes, she returns to take her revenge, destroying the nobleman's castle with her army of beastmen and murdering the nobleman. her army has then taken to raiding nearby villages: however, she has to find and kill kat in order to become a daemon prince and achieve immortality, though she has misgivings about killing the girl (it is constantly hinted, and then finally confirmed later in the story, that she is in fact kat's mother, a pregnancy caused by her rape). the story then returns to gotrek and felix. after slaying a marauding band of beastmen, the three reach another village and warn them of the coming danger. unfortunately, the chaos army learns of their location and justine leads her army in an attack on the village to find kat. the beastmen break into the village and a vicious battle breaks out between the beasts and the villagers. justine battles gotrek, who injures her but cannot kill her (she was gifted with a prophecy that states no warrior can kill her in battle). upon seeing kat, justine abandons her attack and pursues the girl. realising what the chaos champion is after, felix attacks her in an effort to distract her from kat, but is swiftly overpowered. as justine tries to break his neck, kat intervenes and kills justine with her own sword, thus fulfilling the prophecy and saving felix. with their leader dead, the beastmen flee, pursued by the villagers, who slaughter them all. gotrek and felix leave the village the day after the victory. though kat asks to go with them, felix replies they cannot take her with them, as they are bound for more dangerous places where she won't be safe. kat accepts this, and they leave, the three promising never to forget each other... the mutant master the story begins with the pair arriving at the village of blutdorf, on their way to nuln. they learn the villagers are being held to ransom by a sorcerer in a nearby castle who has abducted their children: however, out of fear, the villagers drug the pair and hand them over to the sorcerer. at the castle, the pair wake up in chains. the sorcerer reveals himself to them, and felix recognizes him as albericht kruger, a fellow student from his days at the university of altdorf, kruger having disappeared after stealing forbidden texts on chaos and its mutations. kruger, now a megalomaniac egotist, arrogantly explains that he plans to use the knowledge in the texts to create an army of mutants with which to conquer the empire. however, the pair break free of their captivity and fight back: when kruger sends oleg, the most powerful of his mutated soldiers, to kill them, gotrek strangles the mutant with the chains he was bound with. kruger tries to make his escape, but gotrek and felix pursue, cutting their way through a horde of mutants kruger sends at them. they corner him in his study, where he explains that the mutants they had just killed were in fact the children of the villagers, kruger having discovered children were easier to mutate than adults. in a burst of uncharacteristic fury, felix seizes kruger by the throat and throws him to his death from the castle battlements, an act that meets with gotrek's approval. they set light to the castle and leave for the village, to settle a score... ulric's children the story begins with felix and gotrek heading through the drakwald forest in heavy snow, following the tracks of a monster gotrek believes to be a troll. the forest is unnaturally quiet, but the wolves that dwell in the forest seem unnaturally active... the pair get separated, and felix is captured by a group of imperial soldiers who are actually cultists of the chaos god tzeentch. felix is bound in chains next to another captive, magdalena, a beautiful young woman the cult have captured for their dark purposes... the pair are placed in the dungeons of the cult's leader, count hrothgar, and are interrogated by his lieutenant, the sorcerer voorman. magdalena explains to felix the cult have abducted her to use as bait to trap her father, who is one of the 'children of ulric'- a werewolf. felix manages to escape his captivity and works his way through the manor, killing several of the cultists, including count hrothgar. he discovers that voorman plans to perform a spell on the werewolf that will transfer his soul into its body. as he learns this, the werewolf, leading a massive pack of wolves, attacks the manor, easily defeating the cultists. in the main hall, the monster kills voorman, but not before he completes his spell. as voorman takes possession of the monster's body, felix attacks him with a dagger: a dagger with a blade made of pure warpstone, the only thing that will harm the beast. he manages to defeat the beast; as it dies, the wolves attacking the manor flee, as a new arrival joins the fight: gotrek, who kept on following the tracks until he reached the manor. they capture magdalena, and although felix considers her an innocent in the affair, gotrek believes that as a shapeshifter she is tainted by chaos and kills her. felix later states that this act still haunts him. the pair then carry on for nuln... ||| 2 ||| 2
the story takes place roughly sixteen years after the events of far-seer. in lieu of afsan's discovery of the quintaglio's real place in the universe, the larskian faith has been abolished and worship of the original five hunters reinstated. dybo is now the emperor, with afsan as his court astrologer, and novato has been put in charge of the quintaglio exodus; a project meant to help the quintaglios escape from their doomed world before it breaks apart. toroca, son of afsan and novato, is now head of the geological survey of land, meant to take a global inventory of the resources available for the exodus project. while undertaking the geological survey, toroca finds a mysterious blue artifact, made of a seemingly indestructible material even harder than diamond. it appears to be mechanical, with moving parts, but having been found in some of the oldest rocks, is too old to have been manufactured by quintaglios. he also begins to take notice of clues which cast into doubt his belief in the origin of the world as set forth in the book of lubal. the world appears to be much older than five thousand kilodays, due to the rate of erosion being too slow, and during an expedition to the south pole, he finds that it is inhabited entirely by many unique types of wingfingers. toroca hypothesises that they evolved from a common wingfinger ancestor. meanwhile, dybo's rule has been challenged by rodlox, the governor of the province edz'toolar. as afsan had previously suspected in far-seer, rodlox claims that the children of the previous empress were exempted from the culling of the bloodpriests, with the weakest child being made the future emperor (as opposed to the strongest as tradition dictates) and the rest being sent away so that the royal family could be more easily manipulated. rodlox claims that he is dybo's brother, and that he was the strongest child and thus the rightful emperor. the imperial bloodpriest goes missing shortly after, his absence bolstering rodlox's conspiracy theory. much political turmoil follows; all across the land, bloodpriests are driven out and sometimes killed. with no means of birth control, the quintaglio population begins to swell eightfold as a result. with the quintaglios' natural predisposition towards territorial aggression, it is only a matter of time before civil war erupts. dybo consults afsan, his most trusted advisor, to come up with a solution for the problem. if rodlox were to become the new emperor, he would cancel the exodus and doom the quintaglios to extinction- dybo must win rodlox's challenge. rather than face him in single combat, as dybo would most certainly lose to rodlox, afsan suggests that all eight of the empress' children participate in a replay of the culling, against a scaled up bloodpriest: a blackdeath. such a scenario would give dybo a one-in-eight chance of victory. as afsan helps dybo prepare for his battle against the blackdeath, he finds out that one of his children has been murdered, her throat slashed open by a piece of broken mirror. afsan undertakes an investigation to try to find her killer. dybo begins to train for his battle against the blackdeath. toroca finds himself increasingly attracted to babnol, a member of the geological survey team. babnol in turn worries about toroca's obsession with the blue artifact, and she sneaks into his cabin, steals it, and dumps it overboard. the geological survey team must now head back to where the original artifact was discovered, to try to find another one. meanwhile, back on land, the congestion has gotten unbearable. with the bloodpriests in dispute, seven out of every eight quintaglio hatchlings have not been culled, and the population has swelled. tensions are boiling, and the situation explodes when mass dagamant (a quintaglio bloodlust fueled by territorial aggression) occurs. many quintaglios are killed in the ensuing battle before the situation is defused. it becomes apparent that this will happen again and again until the bloodpriests are reinstated. the geological survey team returns to the coast of fra'toolar, where the original artifact was found, to search for another. to speed up the process, they resort to blasting the cliffs, surmising that the mysterious blue material will not be damaged by the explosions. their blasting exposes an enormous object made of the blue material, and after finding a mysterious double door, explore the inside. within, they find the mummified remains of an extraterrestrial, and various creatures that are extinct on the quintaglio's world, among them, birds. another of afsan's children has been murdered. suspicion falls upon another of afsan's children, drawtood. afsan confronts drawtood, who confesses to his crime. suffering from paranoia, drawtood had intended to murder all of his siblings, out of fear that they were going to come after him. rather than face the consequences of his actions, drawtood commits suicide, and drinks a vial of poison. soon, it is time for the battle against the blackdeath. after being starved for several days, the tyrannosaur is released into an arena, where it proceeds to devour each of the royal siblings one by one. rodlox doesn't go down without a fight, and indeed, almost defeats the blackdeath by utilising his superior agility to disorient it. it topples over and he leaps on its back to deliver the finishing bite; however, he is killed when the blackdeath suddenly rises to its feet and somersaults forward, crushing him with its massive bulk. dybo has studied natural blackdeath behavior prior to the battle, and has come up with a strategy. he positions himself carefully, with the sun setting behind him. as the blackdeath prepares to attack, dybo bites off its own arms, reducing them to stumps, and mimics the dinosaur's roar. in profile, dybo resembles a juvenile t. rex, and the blackdeath retreats, refusing to accept a challenge from what it perceives as a lesser male. dybo is declared the winner, and has earned the right to rule. in the aftermath of the battle, dybo sets about cleaning up the mess the challenge has caused. the bloodpriests are reinstated. the imperial bloodpriest is found, but he has been injured; before he dies, he reveals that dybo was in fact the weakest of the imperial hatchlings; however, the switch was not pulled as an attempt to control the royal family. it is revealed that because the bloodpriests had been saving only the strongest offspring, that the quintaglios had become too aggressive; the bloodpriests were performing a breeding experiment with the royal family, to try to usher in a less violent generation. with the imperial bloodpriest now dead, he needs a replacement; afsan suggests that toroca be appointed as his replacement. with toroca's theory of evolution, afsan presumes that he would be the best person for the job. dybo concurs, and assigns him to the task. meanwhile, wab-novato has finished construction on a prototype glider, based on bird remains recovered from the giant blue structure. the test flight of the machine is a success; the quintaglios have taken their first step towards flight. studies on the giant blue artifact have made it apparent that is an alien starship, and that these beings brought dinosaurs and other creatures to this world from another, millions of years ago; explaining why species in the quintaglios' fossil record appear suddenly rather than gradually. the book ends with dybo declaring that the quintaglios are not merely going to the stars; they are going home. ||| 5 ||| 5
the main character, abélard lindsay, is born in the ancient lunar colony mare serenitatis circumlunar corporate republic, into a family of aristocratic mechanists, but after being sent to the shaper’s ring council, he receives specialized and experimental diplomatic training and gives his loyalty to the shapers' cause. he, his best friend and fellow shaper protege philip constantine and the beautiful and passionate preservationist vera kelland lead an insurgency against the rulers of the republic, who use mechanist technology to prolong their lives. the three of them influence the younger generation towards the shapers' cause in their pursuit of preservationism, a movement devoted to the preservation of earth-bound human culture. kelland and lindsay agree to kill themselves as a political statement, but lindsay reneges on his suicide pact after kelland is dead. constantine attempts to kill lindsay but instead kills a mechanist, creating a scandal. constantine is allowed to remain in the republic because his knowledge is needed to keep the republic's environment from self-destructing but lindsay is exiled to the mare tranquilitatis circumlunar people's zaibatsu. this lunar colony, which collapsed due to an environmental crisis, has become a refuge for "sundogs", criminals, dissidents and wanderers. there he meets kitsune, a woman modified by the shapers to be an ideal prostitute. apparently a servant of the geisha bank, a powerful money center, she in fact rules the bank through the remotely operated body of her now brain-dead predecessor. in his months on the zaibatsu, lindsay uses his diplomatic talents to organize a complex fraud involving a fictitious theatrical event and befriends an old mechanist, fyodor ryumin. however, eventually the fraud takes on a life of its own, and the new-formed kabuki intrasolar becomes a legitimate artistic and business venture. lindsay can't remain to enjoy the profits, though: constantine has in the meantime overthrown the corporate republic's government. constantine has abandoned preservationism to become a shaper militant, and sends an assassin to present a stark choice: become constantine's pawn or be killed by the assassin. lindsay manages to escape with a group of mechanist pirates, in the process aiding kitsune to take power of the geisha bank openly. lindsay joins a ship called the red consensus, which doubles as the nation-state of the fortuna miners' democracy, after the failure of the previously independent asteroid-mining mechanist cartel. the fmd, financed by more wealthy mechanists cartels, annexes the asteroid esairs xii, home to the mavrides family, a small shaper clan. lindsay meets nora mavrides, a fellow diplomat. nora informs abélard that the subjects of the diplomatic training are in disgrace due to the high incidents of treason and defection from their ranks. the two of them work to promote peaceful coexistence between the shaper militants and the mechanist pirates, but after several months of conflict, espionage, murders and sabotages, open fighting breaks out. mavrides and lindsay, now lovers, eventually murder their companions to save one another. before the asteroid's life-support systems shut down after the battle, the alien investors arrive. peace finally comes to the schismatrix after the aliens arrive. the alien investors are obsessed with trade and wealth, and at first encourage humanity to focus on business instead of war. trade flourishes and the shapers and mechanists put their differences aside. lindsay and mavrides become powerful shaper leaders, thanks to their early contact with the investors. the investor peace does not last forever, though, and tensions between shapers and mechanists eventually start to rise when the investors play the factions against one another. ultimately philip constantine rises to power and takes control of the ring council, ousting mavride's and lindsay's pro-détente faction. lindsay runs away from what he sees as a hopeless battle, but nora decides to stay in the rings, where they had built their lives and family, to fight constantine and his militant government. lindsay escapes to the mechanist cartels in the asteroid belt, where kitsune has again secretly taken power. there lindsay works ceaselessly for decades to bring about the détente he believes will reunite him with mavrides. using a recording of an investor's ship queen involved in some taboo activities to blackmail the alien, lindsay contributes to the creation of czarina-kluster, neither shaper nor mechanist, which quickly becomes one of the richest and most powerful states in the solar system. lindsay's partner, wellspring, plans to use the colony to promote his post-humanist ideology, while lindsay himself seeks to bring nora to the new colony. however, constantine discovers mavride's plan to defect and forces her to kill herself. consumed with hatred, lindsay for the first time confronts his former friend directly, arranging a duel with him using an ancient alien artifact called the arena. while lindsay wins, the arena leaves both him and constantine catatonic. years after the duel, lindsay wakes up on his old home, now renamed the neotenic cultural republic. constantine's militant shaperism has been replaced by a preservationist government, dedicated to remaining a cultural preserve where normal, unmodified human life is preserved. as part of the treatment that restored lindsay's mind, his original shaper diplomatic training has been removed. having returned to a preservationist world, and now restored to a fully human state, lindsay decides to break with his past and embrace new dreams. he becomes a post-humanist and returns to czarina-kluster to work with wellspring's 'lifesiders' clique. in the years during lindsays' catatonia, the expansion of settlements throughout the solar system has seen an economy in huge surplus; with abundant wealth, expensive and prolonged terraforming efforts are first being considered. while wellspring seeks to terraform mars, lindsay attempts to create an abyssal ecology on europa. constantine's shaper family has been disgraced by constantine's defeat, and lindsay manages to convert them to his cause, even constantine's "daughter" vera (created from dna taken from vera kelland decades before). as time goes on, eventually czarina-kluster, in its turn, faces social collapse. with his lifesiders faction's research still in its infancy, lindsay and vera constantine secretly break the interdict and bring back samples of earth's abyssal life, providing the breakthroughs that make the europa project a success. as the lifesiders transform themselves into fish-like forms capable of survival in europa's oceans, lindsay visits the now-cured philip constantine. constantine believes that lindsay will never see europa, that he will leave in the end rather than see his cause through to fruition, just as he always had. he also reveals that vera constantine's dna comes as much from lindsay as vera kelland. philip reconciles with abélard, then commits suicide. when lindsay returns to europa, he finds that philip is right—he can't bring himself to undergo the transformation. at that moment, an alien presence, who had followed vera constantine since her mission in an alien embassy, reveals itself. the being explains that it has been devoted to exploring and exulting in the variety of experiences of the universe, and invites lindsay to join it. lindsay accepts and is transformed into a bodiless form, to explore the infinite mysteries of the universe for eternity. ||| 5 ||| 5
as the story starts, the reader is introduced to the fictitious community of treby in the english midlands in 1832, around the time of the first reform act. harold transome, a local landowner, has returned home after a fifteen-year trading career in the far east. wealthy from trade, he stands for election to parliament from the county seat of north loamshire. but contrary to his family's tory traditions, he intends to stand as a radical. this alienates him from his traditional allies and causes despair for his mother, mrs. transome. harold transome gains the support of his tory uncle, the rector of little treby, and enlists the help of his family lawyer, matthew jermyn, as an electioneering agent. much of his electioneering is focused in treby magna. in this village resides felix holt, who has recently returned from extensive travels in glasgow to live with his mother. he meets with rev. rufus lyon, a dissenting minister in treby magna, and his stepdaughter, esther. felix and mr. lyon become ready friends, but he appears to treat esther with condescension. felix and rev. lyon both appear aligned to the radical cause. harold transome learns that jermyn has been mismanaging the transome estate and embezzling money for himself. transome remains silent during the election, yet jermyn tries to devise a plan to save himself from future prosecution. meanwhile, felix witnesses some electioneering for the radical cause in the nearby mining town of sproxton. he is upset with the 'treating' of workers with beer in exchange for their vocal support. felix relays his concerns to harold transome, who chastises john johnson for his electioneering methods. however, jermyn convinces transome not to interfere. rev. lyon learns from maurice christian, servant of philip debarry, about the possible identity of esther's biological father. rev. lyon decides to tell esther the truth about her father. esther's outlook on life changes upon finding that she is in fact rev. lyon's stepdaughter. her relationship with her stepfather deepens, while she also desires to emulate the high moral standards impressed upon her by felix holt. seeing the change in esther's character, felix holt begins to fall in love with her. however, both share the feeling that they are destined never to marry each other. meanwhile, rev. lyon challenges rev. augustus debarry to a theological debate. the debate is initially agreed to, but is cancelled at the last minute. riots erupt on election day in treby magna. drunken mine workers from sproxton assault townspeople and wantonly destroy property. felix holt is caught up in the riots, and tries foolhardily to direct its hostility away from the town. but in the end, felix holt is charged with the manslaughter of a constable who tried to break up the riot. harold transome also loses the election to debarry. harold transome begins legal proceedings against jermyn for the latter's mismanagement of the transome estate. jermyn counters by threatening to publicise the true owner of the transome estate. however, maurice christian informs the transomes that the true owner of the estate is in fact esther lyon. harold transome invites her to the transome estate, hoping to persuade her to marry him. harold and esther establish a good rapport, and esther also becomes more sympathetic with mrs. transome, whose despair has continued to deepen. esther feels torn between harold transome and felix holt. she compares a life of comfortable wealth with harold transome and motherly affection with mrs. transome, to a life of personal growth in poverty with felix holt. meanwhile at felix holt's trial, rev. lyon, harold transome and esther lyon all vouch for his character, but he is nevertheless found guilty of manslaughter. however, harold transome and the debarrys manage to have felix holt pardoned. harold transome proposes to esther lyon, with the eager support of mrs. transome. but despite esther's feelings towards both harold and mrs. transome, she declines the proposal. esther also surrenders her claim to the transome estate. the story ends with felix holt and esther lyon marrying and moving away from treby, along with rev. lyon. matthew jermyn is eventually ruined and moves abroad, while john johnson remains and prospers as a lawyer. the debarrys remain friends with the transomes, and the contest to the transome estate, while widely known, is never discussed. ||| 6 ||| 6
in the realm of faery, the time has come for roiben’s coronation. uneasy in the midst of the malevolent unseelie court, pixie kaye is sure only of one thing— her love for roiben. but when kaye, on faerie wine, declares herself to him, he sends her on a seemingly impossible quest. kaye the protagonist in the novel ironside a modern faery’s tale is given a quest that is described by being “impossible”. now kaye cannot see or speak with roiben unless she can find the one thing she knows does not exist: a faerie who can tell a lie. corny and kaye decide to watch ellen her mother perform in a bar. a male character is watching kaye. corney goes over to him and tells him to back off. unaware that this character is a faery corny speaks to the faery in the bathroom. the faery curses corny so that anything he touches withers. miserable and convinced she belongs nowhere, kaye decides to tell her mother the truth— that she is a changeling left in place of her human daughter stolen long ago. her mother’s shock and horror sends kaye back to the world of the fae to find her human counterpart and bring her back to ironside. but once back in the faery realm, kaye and corny find themselves a pawn in the games of silarial, queen of the seelie court. silarial wants roiben’s throne, and she will use kaye, and any means necessary, to get it. meanwhile, silarial is offering roiben a lifeline- beat her champion and win seven years of peace while placing roiben's sister ethine on the throne instead, or die trying. while she is in the court, the seelie queen attempts to make kaye use roiben's name by bribing her with the return of the "real" kaye. kaye uses a fake name, then escapes with ethine as a hostage. corny later gives ethine back in exchange for the release of a friend's brother. (luis, previously seen in valiant) kaye then finds out that roiben is going to have to battle ethine, not the knight talathain, who they believed was the bright court's champion. she goes to warn roiben. in order to speak to him, kaye must complete his quest, and she does, claiming that she can lie, which in itself is an untruth. he beats ethine but instead of simply killing her, he asks her who she will pass the crown on to. the seelie queen objects to this, but roiben declares that his sister has the right to declare her successor even with her last breath. silarial tells him that if bright court will easily defeat the unseelie court if they were to fight; roiben asks her if she will void their previous bargain, and silarial agrees. roiben reveals that he has gathered an army from the exiled fae, which would overwhelm the seelie court, but silarial then threatens kaye's life. ethine kills silarial with the sword she had been given, declaring that silarial is no longer her queen. ethine now holds the crown because she was silarial's heir, but she chooses to give it to roiben, saying "take it and be damned." roiben states that his sister's hate was a fair price to pay for peace and now rules both the seelie and unseelie courts, and peace will be held as long as he controls both courts. kaye tells roiben that she plans to open a coffee shop in ironside and spend half her time in faery; she reveals that she was able to say she could lie because "lying" can also mean lying on the ground. ||| 7 ||| 2

so that they can control him. he refuses the collar a second time and tries to prevent the second sister, elizabeth, from killing herself. in the riot the third sister, sister verna, manages to stick a knife in sister elizabeth's back. seeking guidance on how to repair the veil, richard and kahlan request another "gathering"; which involves turning to the "ancestors' spirits" for help in the spirit house of the mud people. but instead of being able to speak to the spirits richard and kahlan are sent down to the underworld and are placed face-to-face with darken rahl. he explains that richard has brought him back through the veil by calling "a gathering of ancestors' spirits." thus rahl, as richard's ancestor, is sent back to the world of the living. richard has thereby violated the second rule again. this allows rahl to continue his task of bringing the the keeper into the world. rahl touches richard with the keeper's mark, making him unconscious and lets kahlan know that richard is only minutes away from death. the two of them are sent back to the spirit house from the underworld. as kahlan desperately tries to save richard, a glowing spirit emerges in the spirit house. it is the spirit of denna, who tells kahlan that she has to force richard into wearing the collar, and that if he doesn't, the headaches will kill him and everything will be lost. denna also tells kahlan in detail about the agonizing torture, pain, and madness, that has been inflicted upon richard's mind. denna then puts her hand on richard's mark and takes his place, and is sent down to the underworld and the keeper. as the third and final sister returns, kahlan tells richard that he has to put on the collar. when he tries to explain his reluctance, kahlan makes richard believe that the only way to prove his love for her is to wear it. richard reluctantly agrees to wear the collar and reveals to kahlan that the third reason for wearing the collar is to inflict pain on the wearer. richard has misinterpreted kahlan's intentions, and believes that she no longer loves him. he leaves, telling her merely to find zedd. devastated, richard submits to the remaining sister, and leaves with her to go to the palace of prophets. richard travels with sister verna to the palace of the prophets, which is located in the old world. the sisters see their job as spreading knowledge of the the creator to the world through the training of wizards. before reaching the palace, richard is forced into a battle with thirty baka ban mana blademasters. it is their job it is to teach the seeker to dance with the spirits by using the sword of truth's magic to access the collective knowledge of all previous users of the sword. be a feather, not a rock. float on the wind of the storm is the first tactical advice he receives from the sword's magic. during his stay at the palace richard comes to terms with the fact that he has the gift of magic. he discovers he is a war wizard: one who has the gift of both additive and subtractive magic. later, he learns from nathan rahl, another wizard in the palace of the prophets, that he is the first to be born with such power in three thousand years. it is revealed that the prelate brought richard to the palace to flush out the sisters of the dark, a secret society within the sisters of the light dedicated to the task of unleashing the keeper into the world of the living. as the prelate herself says, "when your house is overrun with rats the only thing you can do is bring in a cat. this cat sees us all as rats. maybe with good reason." richard also finds out that it was the prelate and nathan that helped richard's stepfather, george cypher, retrieve the book of counted shadows, which contains instructions on how to correctly open the boxes of orden. richard also realizes belatedly that the palace of the prophets is the trap in time foretold by shota the witch woman; the palace is spelled so that those within its walls age at a much slower rate. nathan rahl himself is close to one thousand years old. kahlan embarks on a long trek back to her home of aydindril along with three mud people. along the way they come across a sacked city, ebinissia, with the inhabitants' corpses filling the streets and the surrounding countryside. kahlan and the three mud people race to catch up with a band of some five thousand troops that are trailing the enemy which sacked ebinissia. she is shocked to realize that these soldiers are all younger than expected. she assumes command of this youthful army and begins to strategize tactics for taking on the much larger army of what she now knows to be the imperial order. after months of imprisonment, richard escapes and races to stop a prophecy from coming to pass. namely, the one he received in the valley of the lost: of all there were, but a single one born of the magic to bring forth truth will remain alive when the shadow's threat is lifted. therefore comes the greater darkness of the dead. for there to be a chance at life's bond, this one in white must be offered to her people, to bring their joy and good cheer. the prophecy speaks of the beheading of his beloved kahlan, whom he now realizes was only trying to help him by sending him with the sisters. only by fulfilling the prophecy can richard close the veil and thwart darken rahl, casting the keeper back into the underworld with the eponymous stone of tears. after richard returns the stone of tears to the underworld and once again defeats darken rahl and the keeper, he rushes to aydindril to find kahlan. upon finding kahlan has already been executed, richard kills all the councillors who sentenced kahlan to death. he is unaware that zedd has cast a death spell to make all believe that kahlan is dead. denna's spirit visited the both of them and they were reunited in a place between worlds. ||| 2 ||| 2
the narrative focuses around moz, zahler, pearl, alana ray and minerva, in an apocalyptic new york. odd occurrences are taking place, the sewers are gushing black water, the earth shakes, and people are inexplicably going mad. in the midst of it all, two friends begin to see their dreams realized. moz and zahler have been friends for six years, playing their guitars without any clear direction. they have always dreamed of forming a band, but have never managed to quite get it done. moz meets pearl, a mysterious girl with a knack for music, who he teams up with to save a guitar that a crazy woman throws out of her window. when they begins learning more about one another, the image of a band becomes clear. with pearl at their head, the band begins to recruit new members and take form. as the band becomes more and more real, new members join. alana ray, a skilled drummer and street performer with a mysterious condition that is never quite made clear (although is most likely to be some advanced form of synesthesia), joins them under the condition that moz pays her. however, moz keeps this deal secret from pearl to gain something resembling control over the band. alana ray has the ability to see colored lights, which she considers to be hallucinations at times, and realistic at others. she often mentions that she is able to "see" the music they play. pearl also convinces minerva, her long-term friend, to join the band as their lead singer. minerva was in a band with pearl previously, but they broke up when minerva contracted the parasite causing the madness in the city and begins to hate all the people she once loved, and she begins to hate her boyfriend, another member of the band, causing her to break up with him, thus breaking up the band. minerva's parents have hired a woman, luz, who believes in natural means to fight the parasite instead of the artificial means of modern doctors. minerva uses these traditional methods such as garlic and rosemary to keep off the worst effects of the parasite, taught to her by luz. zahler eventually changes over from his position as lead guitarist to playing the bass, due to the fact he normally plays lower parts regardless and his fingers are suited for the larger instrument. initially, he is unhappy that pearl and moz had devised this plan without his consent. however, he soon grows used to the bass. meanwhile, moz and minerva begin to date in secret, causing the parasite to be passed on from minerva to moz. the band soon receives a recording contract with astor michaels, a man who is a carrier, who is known for having discovered a new type of music called "new sound". he has been searching for a new type of music which involves a member of the band being infected, creating quite a unique effect. because of minerva, and soon the newly infected moz, astor michaels soon believes to have discovered the perfect band. the five are still struggling to agree on a name for their band, but otherwise their band seems to be making its way quickly to fame. moz begins playing in the subway to help raise money for the band, until things turn strange one night. a giant worm lurks in the nearby tunnels, and moz is instinctively drawn to it, all of his instincts screaming to kill it. before he gets the chance to attack it, the "angels", seemingly defenders of the city against the people who have lost their minds, jump down to fight the worm. they soon reveal themselves to actually be carriers of the parasite from the new watch (featured in peeps), including cal and lace from peeps. they attempt to bring moz to new jersey to treat his parasite, but he runs away, fearing letting down the band by missing their first gig. the band plays for its first time in a club at night, but it does not go perfectly as planned. zahler freezes up in the beginning, although he eventually overcomes his stage fright and starts the song. but minerva's song causes another giant worm to break through the ground, killing many people in the process. the new watch comes to defeat the worm, and rounds up the whole band to take them to the new jersey lab, but not before moz smashes his beloved guitar because of the parasite. moz receives treatment for the parasite in new jersey, and when he has almost completely recovered, he and the rest of the band members visit the shrink, a character included in peeps. the shrink believes that minerva's singing has called up the worm, and that she can use this ability to help defeat them. even the nightmayor, centuries old, can barely remember this ancient talent as it was used in the previous resurfacing of the worms. none of the previous bands employed by astor michaels were able to achieve this same result because one member was infected, but not the lead singer. the new watch recruits the band to sing to cause the worms to surface all around the country, thus allowing the new watch to fight them on their own terms. the band goes on tour, travelling wherever they are needed, and pearl finally comes up with the perfect name for the band: the last days. they become heroes of sorts, and finally achieve their dreams of fame, although not in the way that they originally planned. in the end, the worm attacks have ended, and civilization is rebuilding itself. moz and minerva are revealed to still be together, although they have broken up and gotten back together numerous times. pearl has turned into a politician and is running for mayor of new york "again", leaving the fate of the rest of the characters unknown. ||| 7

jerome branch corbell has incurable cancer and is cryogenically frozen in the year 1970 in the faint hope of a future cure. his body is revived in 2190 by an oppressive, totalitarian global government called "the state". his personality and memories are extracted (destroying his body in the process) and transferred into the body of a mindwiped criminal. after he is awakened, he is continually evaluated by peerssa, a "checker", who has to decide whether he is worth keeping. with the threat of mindwiping looming over his head, corbell works hard to pass the various tests. peerssa decides that corbell is a loner and born tourist. this makes him an ideal candidate to be the pilot and sole passenger of a bussard ramjet, whose mission is to find and seed suitable planets as the first step to terraforming them. disgusted with the state's treatment of him as an expendable commodity, corbell hijacks the ship and takes it to the centre of the galaxy. it was at this point that the original short story ended. peerssa tries to talk him out of it, but fails. peerssa and the state resort to subterfuge; an artificial intelligence program based on peerssa's personality is secretly transferred into the ship's computer by way of the conversations. though the peerssa ai opposes the detour, it cannot disobey corbell's direct orders. after a lengthy journey (including a close approach to the super-massive black hole at the galactic axis), possible only due to the suspended animation devices on board, corbell returns to the solar system. although only hundreds of years have passed on the ship, three million years have elapsed on earth, due to relativistic time dilation. at first, he is confused and initially believes they might have come to the wrong system because it has changed considerably; the sun has apparently evolved into a red giant and earth is now in orbit around a super-hot jupiter. corbell and peerssa eventually find that the solar system has been engineered into this new configuration in order to move the earth to a habitable distance from the enlarged sun, but this revelation only comes later in the book. corbell puts the ship into orbit around the earth. the earth's climate has changed, despite its new location in orbit around jupiter. among the most important changes is the increased surface temperature; the poles are temperate, while the former temperate zones reach temperatures of over 50 degrees celsius (120+ degrees fahrenheit). the earth's axial tilt is still 23.5 degrees so the poles experience 6 years of night and 6 years of day. almost all remaining life on earth has adapted to live in antarctica. elsewhere life is extinct except for some evidence of biological activity in the himalayan mountains. when corbell lands (in a modified biological probe), he is captured by mirelly-lyra, who is also a returned star ship pilot and refugee from the past—though from corbell's (and peerssa's) future. she explains that the human species has fragmented; it is dominated by a race of immortal, permanently pre-adolescent males (the boys), who are created by advanced medical techniques. some time in the past, they had defeated the equally immortal (though now extinct) girls, in the ultimate war of the sexes. the boys have enslaved the dikta, who are unmodified humans (though they have evolved somewhat), from whom they take boys to replenish their ranks. a starship pilot, mirelly-lyra had initially been a captive toy of the girls. after their downfall, she had spent her time obsessively searching in vain for the lost adult-immortality treatment, while extending her life as much as possible using her own drugs and a form of zero-time stasis with which she waited for another returning star ship and potential help. because she could not stop the aging process entirely, she is an old crone by the time she finds corbell. he manages to escape from her, only to be caught by the boys, who take him to a dikta settlement. with gording, the dikta leader, he escapes once more. eventually, corbell discovers the adult-immortality treatment, albeit by accident and only realizing it after he himself has been exposed to it. he uses it to enlist mirelly-lyra's help, which in turn finally gives him full control of his ship's technology (the hostile peerssa has decided that the woman is the last survivor of the state and will only obey her). the planet uranus has been discovered to have been maneuvered to pass by the earth and adjust its orbit by peerssa the ai. corbell arranges for the earth's distance from the super-heated jupiter to be adjusted by peersa to lower the earth's temperature without destroying the plants and animals that have adapted to the extreme conditions. as the novel closes, he is plotting to liberate the dikta and enable them to regain control of their own destiny. ||| 5 ||| 5
doctor simms, the headmaster of the coldbrook country school - to which the five wayward youths, all sixteen years old, have been dispatched – succinctly lays out the “plot” to nat rittenhouse, the school’s hired assassin: :"we take them off their hands, those lemons. once and for all. quick and neat and clean and utterly untraceable. we have those limestone faults quite near the school-these fissures on the surface of the planet. some of them seem almost bottomless. drop a lemon into one....we never hear it hit. we call that 'grounding', mr. rittenhouse. a natural and wholesome term, i hope you will agree. at coldbrook, we are definitely....organic." but the twenty-two year old nat, who agreed to take on the poisoning of the kids so he could pay off a gambling debt he owed to gangsters, bonds with the members of group 6. he sees nothing much wrong with the kids, and soon becomes really fond of them. these are the five in group 6: * lean and lanky, bitter coke, who has trouble keeping his shirttails in, has packed cigarettes and white rum in his backpack. * the more naïve, much shorter sully hates his life in new york city and his mother’s dreadful “manfriend”. * potty-mouthed and funny, marigold is wise as well as cynical. she slept with one of her mother’s boyfriends. * athletic, organized, popular sarah is an over-achiever who was driven to cheat on an english paper. * and ludi, who can see things and hear sounds that are not “there”, has ways and attitudes that just enrage her father. at first, nat does not have the heart to let the kids in on the truth, but he finally breaks the news after they have pieced some clues together on their own. nat also tells them that because he has not killed them he’s on the school’s hit list, too. from that point on, nat and group 6 are a team, living mostly in a cabin he built in the woods, a few miles from the school. even as the kids begin to master survival skills, a hunt begins. because it was the gangsters who provided nat to the school, they are shamed by his failure to do the killing, so they send an employee to kill him. and two outrageous middle-aged members of the school’s faculty, a man and a woman, who are both crack shots, take their rifles into the woods, looking for nat and the kids. eventually, the headmaster recruits the entire student body to join in the search, because one of those odd faculty members has mysteriously “vanished”. with most of the school’s population combing the woods, the kids dare to enter the school to search for proofs of their parents’ dreadful (and criminal) “deal”. the climax of the book is there for you to read. suffice it to say that in the course of their time together the kids make peace with the loss of their old families and gain an unbreakable appreciation of their new one. english journal reviewer, dick abrahamson noted that it is the plot and characters that drive the story and hold the reader's interest: "it is the plot that keeps the reader turning the pages of this book. characterization is handled by having the individual teenagers react to each other. the reader watches the teenagers deal with the horror of finding out that their parents have paid to have them killed. we also watch as the individuals of group 6 develop a sense of responsibility and a love for each other." norma fox mazer, a ya author, said that "the author has taken a grotesque subject and made of it a story not only scary, but, praise be, funny. reading the book, i laughed as often as i shivered and turned pages as fast as possible to find out that most basic and important of all things - what is going to happen." ||| 7 ||| 0

chapter 1 — spending the night in the cupola of his grandfather's house that gives him a panoramic view of the town, douglas wakes up early on the first day of summer and performs an elaborate series of actions that coincide with the lightening of the sky and awakening of the townspeople. he does this in such a way that implies magic, thus setting the basis of the novel as collections of life events tinged with a degree of fantasy. chapter 2 (illumination)—douglas goes with his ten-year-old brother tom and his father to pick fox grapes. while tom and his father act like today is just an ordinary day, douglas senses an inexplicable presence around them. when tom initiates a friendly rough-and-tumble fight between the two of them, douglas suddenly realizes what it is: the revelation that he's alive. he finds it to be a glorious and liberating feeling. chapter 3 (dandelion wine) — dandelion wine is presented as a metaphor of summer here, bottled for the winter season of illnesses and wheezing. in douglas' words: "dandelion wine. the words were summer on the tongue. the wine was summer caught and stoppered." chapter 4-5 (summer in the air) — douglas discovers that his feet won't move as fast as that of the other boys because his sneakers are worn out. he becomes entranced by a pair of brand-new cream-sponge para litefoot shoes in a shop window, and thinks on how the need for a "magic" pair of sneakers to run in the green grass is something only boys can understand when his father argues against buying another. the local shoe seller, mr. sanderson, is initially resistant to selling the sneakers to douglas, especially since he doesn't even have enough money to pay for them upfront. douglas, however, convinces him to try on a pair of his own sneakers, which triggers memories in mr. sanderson of when he was a kid and ran like the antelopes and gazelles. he agrees to let douglas have the sneakers in return for work done by him in the shop to pay off the bill. the story ends with douglas speeding away in the distance and mr. sanderson picking up his discarded old sneakers. chapter 6 — douglas shows to tom a tablet that he is using to record his summer in, under two sections labeled "rites and ceremonies" and "discoveries and revelations." the contents are what would be expected for a kid, including a "revelation" that kids and grown-ups don't get along with each other because they're "separate races and 'never the twain shall meet.'" tom suggests a revelation of his own; that night is created from "shadows crawling out from under five billion trees." chapter 7 (season of sitting) — another ritual of summer is accomplished with the setting up of the porch swing as a place for night-long conversation. douglas comments on how sitting in the porch swing feels somehow "right" because one would always be comforted by the droning, ceaseless voices of the adults. in keeping up with the fantasy-tinged atmosphere of the novel, the chapter gradually shifts from a realistic beginning, in which the family is setting up the swing, to an almost dreamlike conclusion, in which the grown-ups' voices are personified as drifting on into the future. chapter 8-9 (the happiness machine) — leo auffmann, listening to elderly people's gloomy and fatalistic conversations, insists that they should not dwell on such miserable topics. douglas and his grandfather, passing by, suggest to leo that he should make a happiness machine. after the conversing people laugh at this apparently absurd idea, leo becomes determined to do just that. a brief scene of him returning to his family of six children indicates his happiness at home, exemplified when his wife lena asks, "something's wrong?" after leo expresses his desire to build a happiness machine. chapter 10 (the night) — interposed between leo's story is another tale referring to douglas' family. it starts out relatively uneventfully, with tom running to mrs. singer's store to get ice cream at nine o'clock on the same night for him and douglas. however, by nine-thirty, douglas has not returned, which causes his worried mother to venture to the ravine with tom. tom, despite the darkness of the night, feels safe because he is holding his mother's hand and also because he has little understanding of death. his sense of security, however, vanishes when he feels his mother's hand tremble and realizes that she is afraid, like him. the ensuing revelation that apparently unfazed grown-ups feel loneliness and pain too unnerves him and makes him aware of the darkness surrounding them. just before he feels overwhelmed, douglas and his friends return, breaking the spell of aloneness. tom later tells douglas that the ravine would not belong in leo's happiness machine, thus contrasting the pleasures humans wish for with the realities they receive instead. chapter 11 (the happiness machine–continued) — in a relatively short chapter, leo sits with his wife lena on the porch swing in the night. lena tells him that they don't need a happiness machine, but leo says that he's going to build the machine for others that would cure all melancholy. he is greeted with only silence, but is too preoccupied with noting the sounds of nature that would belong in the machine to notice this foreshadowing. chapter 12 (the lawns of summer) — another interception of leo's story which re-focuses on the spaulding family; douglas' grandfather begins the day, happily reveling in the sound of the lawn mower running on their lawn, an indicator to him that summer has truly begun. grandma, however, tells him that bill forrester, the man cutting their grass, is planning to plant new grass on their lawn that will only grow to a certain height, thus eliminating the need for lawn mowers. (note: no such grass actually exists yet in the real world) horrified at this, grandpa gives bill a firm lecture on how little things can matter more than the big ones, especially to experienced people like him. bill attempts to change his mind, but only convinces grandpa further of his position when he learns that the new grass will kill off the dandelions. grandpa finally pays bill the cost of the grass flats in return for him not installing the flats in his lawn. he takes a nap and wakes up in the afternoon to find bill cutting the lawn again, having learned to appreciate the "little things," thanks to grandpa. chapter 13 (the happiness machine — continued) — leo, still obsessed with creating the happiness machine, asks lena if she is "pleased, contented, joyful, [or] delighted." lena gives a sarcastic reply which offends leo who is taking his goal seriously, and they get into an argument. the squabble ends only when lena realizes that she's burned their dinner for the first time in twenty years. leo then spends several weeks toiling in his garage to build his happiness machine. during this time, the state of his family disintegrates, but leo is too busy with his invention to pay attention to his wife's warnings. at last, leo completes his happiness machine. ironically, the machine turns out to cause misery instead of the expected bliss, causing both saul, his son, and lena to weep after sitting in it. lena explains to him that a happiness machine cannot be built for humans because it would only give them everything they wanted all the time, and produce no fulfillment. furthermore, it makes them pine for things they shouldn't even be thinking about, such as when a dancing stimulation in the machine caused her to miss the times when leo would take her out for dances, hence causing them to feel only unhappiness about their lives. leo, still disbelieving, decides to take a test run in the machine himself, but just as he is about to do so, the machine catches fire, and burns down to the ground. after the incident, leo comments to douglas and his father that he's been a fool because the real happiness machine has been right in front of him all along. he shows them his newfound happiness machine running in perfect order — his family. chapter 14 — as the spaulding family prepares to shake out the rugs, douglas and tom's imaginations turn this chore into a magical discovery, fancying that they see the happenings and neighbors in their town in the stains of one rug. a lavish metaphor at the end of the chapter describes tom beating the rug so hard that the dust rises up to meet him, another surrealistic chapter ending possibly a reference to the judeo-christian belief that man was created from dust. chapter 15-16 (season of disbelief) — mrs. bentley, a seventy-two year old woman who saves all memorabilia from her past, finds her beliefs challenged by two girls named alice and jane, who meet her along with tom and don't believe her when she says that she was young like them once. claiming that she's lying, they run away laughing, leaving mrs. bentley infuriated. the next time they meet, mrs. bentley shows them some of her relics, including a photograph of her as a child. alice and jane say that the objects don't prove anything, since she could have got them from another girl, and mrs. bentley's insistence that they will one day be old like her fails to unnerve them. they run away with her "stolen" possessions, further shaking mrs. bentley's confidence in the authenticity of her childhood. as she sifts through her memorabilia, she hears the voice of her husband speaking to her, explaining that the items don't really belong to her because they came from the past, not from the present she is living in now. even affidavits wouldn't change the fact that she's no longer the self that the saved clothes and pictures were meant for. mrs. bentley finally understands, and discards the tokens of her past the next day with the help of the girls and tom. from then on, she lives in the present only, confirming the girls' belief that she was never young "in a million trillion years." in a following chapter, tom later tells douglas of his revelation that old people never truly were young, which douglas writes down in his tablet. chapter 17-18 (the last, the very last) — douglas and tom are introduced to a living "time machine" in the form of colonel freeleigh who narrates incredibly vivid descriptions of his personal experiences, including a fatal bullet trick performed by ching ling soo, being on the prairie with pawnee bill, and witnessing the battle of fort sumter. his anecdotes draw the boys themselves into the detailed events, and all agree that the colonel is a true time machine. similar to the previous story in chapter 14, there is an expository chapter in which douglas and tom record the story in douglas' tablet and provide both casual and profound commentary on its implications. chapter 19 (the green machine) — two elderly women, miss fern and miss roberts, take refuge in their attic after they accidentally run over mister quartermain while riding the green machine, believing him to be dead. huddling together, they recall the time when they bought the green machine from a salesman as a noiseless, smooth form of transportation. the first week on the green machine went by like a dream, until the accident with mister quartermain. fern and roberts lament on how they did not stop or at least get help for him, and then resolve to not drive the green machine ever again. later on, they learn that mister quartermain did not die after all. chapter 20 (the trolley) — douglas is horrified to find out that yet another form of transportation for the summer is about to be gone; the trolley run by mr. tridden, which will have its tracks replaced with new ones for a bus. on the last day of operation mr. tridden offers the children a free ride, and douglas, tom, and a group of children from the neighbourhood climb aboard. during the ride, they comment on how a bus cannot emulate the feel and smell of a trolley, further emphasized by use of gorgeous imagery to describe the sights the boys see while in the trolley. at the end of the line, mr. tridden uses an emergency generator to take the streetcar on a track line abandoned for eighteen years that leads to a lake where once the trolley took people to summer festivities. mr tridden relates the events of a summer night in 1910 before taking the children home. when the trip concludes, douglas reflects on how he will always remember the trolley tracks, even after they have been buried in reality. in a humorous reversal, the somber meditation on the vanishing of the trolley is punctuated by a brief snippet of douglas agreeing to a game of kick the can, abruptly ending the chapter on a lighthearted note. chapter 21-22 (statues — created for novel) — douglas' best friend john huff is introduced and described in this chapter as the ideal boy to be friends with. john, however, tells douglas that his family will be moving tomorrow. in response to douglas' protests, john comments on how he has suddenly realized that he's taken so many things for granted in his neighborhood that he can't remember most of them, including his parents' faces, and on how he's afraid that douglas will similarly forget him. douglas assures him that he has a perfect memory of his face, but ruins his claim when he can't remember that john's eyes are green. douglas attempts to enjoy his last day with john, but keeps on being reminded of the diminishing amount of time before john's departure. he tries a last-ditch effort to keep john from leaving by "freezing" him for three hours when the children play statues. john refuses to play along and instead begins another round of statues, in which he "freezes" douglas instead just before he leaves for good. after he realizes that john is gone for good, douglas, thinking of how statues stay still compared to humans who can't be controlled, yells out into the distance that he hates john. another expository chapter, this one the shortest yet at only one page, has douglas asking tom to promise that he will stay with him. he also says that he's concerned about how god runs the world, to which tom replies simply, "he tries," most likely an accepting remark that life isn't perfect. chapter 23-24 — elmira brown, a high-strung woman, believes that clara goodwater, her rival for the position of president for the honeysuckle ladies lodge, is a witch who is causing her numerous small accidents, including tripping over objects in front of her. elmira accuses clara of performing dark magic on her to sabotage her chances in the election, using information from her mailman husband about a stack of books for magic spells that was sent to her house. clara, in response, says that the books are for her younger cousin, and claims that elmira's accidents are caused by her own clumsiness. unconvinced, elmira brews a potion for herself to counter clara's "dark magic," and brings tom with her to the ladies' meeting as her "charm." the potion, however, does not stop her from continuing to knock things over, and she in fact begins to feel strangely disoriented as she talks on the platform. elmira loses the election yet again to clara, who then draws from her purse a voodoo doll with several tacks embedded in it. a dazed elmira asks tom to show her the way to the restroom, but she makes a wrong turn and tumbles down a flight of stairs. miraculously, she has no broken bones despite heavy bruises, and clara apologizes to her and even offers a second vote to elect her as president. the story ends with all the women running up the stairs, laughing and crying at the same time. it is left unclear on whether elmira's fall was caused by mental disorder, nausea after drinking her "potion," or real witchcraft by clara. another one-page chapter shows tom telling douglas about his weird encounter with the ladies at the lodge, and they comment on how the town is full of magic, illustrating how kids view events differently than grown-ups do. chapter 25-26 (the window) — colonel freeleigh, the same "time machine" the boys listened to in chapter 17, has been confined to a hospital for his weakening health. his sole comfort is a phone in his room that he can use to dial the number of an old friend in mexico city who lays his phone on an open window to allow him to hear the bustling noises outside. when the nurse learns of his phone calls, she tells him that she will give orders to take the phone away to prevent him from overworking his heart further. a desperate freeleigh, feeling his chest pains worsen, dials his friend's number once more, begging for one last listening to the sounds of the city people. as his friend does so, freeleigh immerses himself in the activity of mexico city, thinking of how grateful he is for this reminder that the world is still alive and moving. when douglas and the other children stop by for a visit, they find freeleigh dead, still holding the phone. douglas listens to the phone in time to hear "two thousand miles away, the closing of a window," a metaphor for freeleigh's death. in the following chapter, douglas sits silently as tom pretends to be a civil war soldier, pondering on how with colonel freeleigh's death, all of his memories of the historical figures died too. tom, however, fails to share in his brooding, only suggesting that he write his thoughts down in his tablet before resuming his play. chapter 27 — july has ended, and thirty-one bottles of dandelion wine have been made. douglas, remembering his recent string of losses of friends and machines, wonders why each bottle looks identical and not representative of the day it was made on. he says out loud that august will be tedious and uneventful, to which his grandfather attempts to remedy his melancholy with a swig of dandelion wine and some ordered exercises. chapter 28-29 (the swan) — bill forrester, with douglas at his side, orders lime-vanilla ice at the soda fountain. his unusual request catches the attention of ninety-five year old helen loomis who invites him to visit her house tomorrow. bill complies, and he and helen start a friendly conversation about the appearances people keep up for each other, that soon diverges into loomis acting as a "time machine" similar to colonel freeleigh to transport bill into the pyramids of egypt. bill comments on how comfortable he feels talking to her, and helen replies by reminding him that she's only an old woman. while lounging in his chair, bill attempts to envision her as being young again; he succeeds for a moment in seeing "the swan," which he unintentionally says out loud, strangely disquieting helen. bill continues to visit helen every day for two and a half weeks, but only on the last day does he tell her what motivated him to visit her in the first place: a photograph taken of her when she was twenty. he had seen the picture in the newspaper for the town ball and intended to go to the ball to seek the beautiful girl it showed, until someone told him that the picture had been taken a long time ago and had been used by the newspaper every year since then to advertise the ball. helen replies with an overview of a young man she once knew in her youth who was handsome but wild and reckless; he left her, but when she saw bill at the fountain that day, she was strongly reminded of him — almost as if he were a reincarnation of her former companion. some time later, bill finds helen writing a letter addressed to him. helen explains to him that she will be dead in a few days, and that the letter she is writing will come to him then. when bill attempts to protest about the lack of time they have had together, helen says that she believes that they will meet again sometime later — possibly in reincarnated forms. she tells him to marry and live happily, but says that he has to die before the age of fifty in order to ensure that when they are reincarnated, they will be of the correct ages and be able to meet and fall in love with each other. two days later, bill receives the letter. inside it is a note reading, "a dish of lime-vanilla ice." the next chapter shifts back to the viewpoint of douglas, who asks tom on how come mr. forrester and mrs. loomis did not get a happy ending, as in the movies. however, the boys' attentions are quickly distracted from the subject when they arrive at summer's ice house, and turn to the legend of the lonely one in the town, acting as an introduction to the next story. in the expository chapter, it is revealed in the conversation between doug, tom, and charlie that lavinia killed the lonely one by stabbing him with a pair of sewing scissors. charlie berates lavinia for killing off their main source of thrills, but tom convinces him that the actual lonely one is still alive because the man they took in looked like "a plain, everyday man who wouldn't pull the wings off even so much as a fly," instead of the tall, bulgy-eyed monster they think he should look like. neither of them listen to douglas who says that he was at the ravine at that time and witnessed lavinia discovering elizabeth's body, and thus can no longer treat the lonely one as just an amusingly scary figure. chapter 32 (good-by, grandma) — douglas' great-grandma, after countless years of assisting her family, feels that her time is expiring with a growing tiredness. she lies down in her bed amidst the protests of her relatives, waiting for her death. when douglas asks her who's going to do all the chores she did around the house, she says that they belong to anyone who wants them, and reminds him that she will not truly be dead in his mind. as her family leaves her to rest alone, she returns to the dream she was in before she was born, dying happily and peacefully. chapter 33 — disillusioned by the recent deaths and losses, douglas, by the light of a multitude of fireflies, writes for a long time on the shortcomings of things and people, associating them mainly with breaking down (machines) or death (people). he seems to be on the verge of a great revelation as he quickly scribbles at the end a summary of the dark side of his summer experience: "so if trolleys and runabouts and friends and near friends can go away for a while or go away forever, or rust, or fall apart or die, and if people can be murdered, and if someone like great-grandma, who was going to live forever, can die…if all of this is true…then…i, douglas spaulding, some day, must…" however, the fireflies&#39; light has gone out, so douglas stops writing and releases the fireflies into the night. he then tries to fall asleep. chapter 34 (the tarot witch–created for novel) — douglas takes tom to a penny arcade to show him the mechanical tarot witch there. when tom asks him why he wanted him to see her, douglas says that he asks too many questions. he then thinks to himself that it&#39;s because he was initially elated when he realized that he was alive, before he realized that being alive meant that he must die someday too, no matter how much he wants to prevent it. no longer certain about his life, he wants to take comfort in something that he knows never will go away, i.e. the permanent amusements at the carnival. douglas gets a typical fortune from the tarot witch, but the card she gives tom is blank. tom suggests that the witch might have run out of ink, but douglas insists that the blank card must have some special meaning. thinking that she might have written a message in invisible ink on the back of the card, douglas runs a match over it. he accidentally burns up the card in the process, but says that he read a french message from the witch, calling for help. he comes to the conclusion that the witch is really a princess trapped in hot wax that someone poured over her. douglas plots to &#34;rescue&#34; the tarot witch by overloading a machine with coins so that mr. black, the carnival manager, will use them to get drunk. mr. black, however, goes crazy and smashes the witch&#39;s glass case. douglas jumps in to stop him; just as mr. black is about to attack him with a knife, he passes out from his drinking. douglas and tom confiscate the witch, planning to free her, but just as they reach the ravine, mr. black reappears and flings the witch into the ravine, to douglas&#39; horror. later on in the day, douglas and tom return to where the tarot witch is lying. douglas says to tom that the witch is really alive, and that someday he will be able to free her from the wax with magic spells so that the witch will become just another figurine. as he mentions their fortunes, another blank card falls from her sleeve. douglas exclaims that it must be written with her thanks and a prediction that they will &#34;live forever.&#34; chapter 35 (hotter than summer) — douglas comes upon tom who is counting the times cicadas buzz every fifteen seconds to measure the temperature. douglas reads the home thermometer as reading 87°f (31°c), but tom, after finishing his count, says that it is actually 92° (33°c) spaulding. feeling woozy, douglas begins subconsciously counting to the cicadas&#39; buzzes too. chapter 36-38 (dinner at dawn) — this story focuses upon mr. jonas and his wagon full of discarded objects that he totes around town in the very early morning, allowing people to take what they need from it at no cost; many of them donating some of their old items to the wagon before it moves on forward again. on a scorchingly hot morning, with the cicadas buzzing louder than normal with the rising temperature, douglas lies in his bed, burning up with a fever. tom and his mother attempt to cool him down, to no avail. in his fever, douglas has hallucinations of long-lost people and machines walking past, including mr. tridden and his trolley, miss fern and roberts riding by on their green machine, and colonel freeleigh popping up like a clock, all waving good-bye to him, which makes him cry out loud. at four o&#39;clock in the afternoon, tom tells mr. jonas about douglas&#39; condition and says that he&#39;s afraid that he might die. mr. jonas gives him a set of wind-chimes to hang by douglas&#39; window, but they do not make a sound because there is no wind. mr. jonas visits the spaulding residence to see douglas at seven-thirty, but douglas&#39; mother says that he is not to be disturbed. by nightfall, douglas is no better, and his family takes him outside in a cot, in the hope that he will be cooled by a wind. finally, at twelve-thirty, mr. jonas makes a stop with his wagon where douglas is sleeping and leaves him two bottles filled with air containing soothing vapor and smells from the tropics and moisture-filled areas, on the condition that he pass this favor on to someone else. the bottles of air appear to work, as tom finds douglas breathing the same refreshing air in and out of his nose. the next morning, the heat and the cicadas finally fade down with the coming of rain, and douglas is well enough to write in his tablet again of his experience. chapter 39 (the magical kitchen) — douglas&#39; grandma is renowned in the household for her divine cooking for the entire family. aunt rose, however, threatens this magic when she questions grandma&#39;s methods of cooking, and later persuades grandma to organize her kitchen, wear glasses, and read from a cookbook while cooking. this systematic cooking that results, however, destroys the uniqueness and magicalness of grandma&#39;s dinners for the rest of the family. in response to this, grandpa bids aunt rose good-bye, but grandma appears to have lost her touch for cooking. while the rest of the members are awake in their beds, douglas sneaks down to the kitchen and restores it back to its original chaos, getting rid of the glasses and the cookbook. the family heads downstairs to find that grandma has reconnected with her cooking again as it was meant to be, and everyone enjoys a magnificent late dinner. the chapter closes with douglas thinking on how he repaid mr. jonas by passing on his favor. chapter 40 (green wine for dreaming–created for novel) — the final chapter of the novel concludes douglas&#39; summer, as he and tom spot school supplies advertised for sale in a shop window. the boys reminisce about the events of summer with the aid of the labeled dandelion wine bottles, guaranteeing that they will remember this summer in their hearts. the spaulding family stores away their porch swing for autumn, as others reverse their summer preparations as the season draws to an end. the end of the novel echoes the beginning, with douglas performing his waking-up act in reverse, pretending to switch the lights off and put everyone else to sleep before finally going to sleep himself, ending a very eventful and memorable summer. ||| 2 ||| 0
deep six opens in 1966 aboard the refitted liberty ship san marino on its way from san francisco to auckland, new zealand. the ship is carrying more than eight million dollars worth of titanium ingots as well as a mysterious passenger who goes by the name of estelle wallace. wallace is actually arta casilighio, a former bank teller at the beverly-wilshire bank who embezzled more than $120,000 and is making her getaway. unfortunately, for her and the rest of the crew, a group of korean seamen who came aboard as last-minute crew replacements have hijacked the ship and its cargo, and conveniently dispose of wallace and the crew by paralyzing them with poison in their food and dropping them over the side into the depths of the ocean. the story then flashes forward twenty-three years to the waters off of augustine island, alaska where an extremely deadly poison is moving through the waters, killing everything it comes in contact with. the poison comes to the notice of the coast guard cutter catawaba when it intercepts a derelict crab boat called the amie marie. the men sent aboard to investigate discover that the entire crew has died horribly, bleeding from every orifice and their skin had turned black. the boarding party soon begins to exhibit symptoms themselves. the doctor sent aboard orders the captain of the catawaba to quarantine the crab boat and calls off his symptoms as the poison overtakes him, hoping that this information will help others in their diagnosis. it is later revealed that the symptoms of the mysterious poison are strikingly similar to those of a deadly biological weapon, called nerve agent s, developed by the rocky mountain arsenal outside of colorado as the ideal weapon for use on troops wearing gas masks and protective clothing. the agent clings to everything and is absorbed through the skin, resulting in almost immediate death. the weapon was eventually discontinued by the army because it was as deadly to the troops deploying it as it was to the enemy. while en route to be buried in the nevada desert, an entire boxcar carrying more than 1,000 gallons of nerve agent s disappeared. dirk pitt and his friend, assistant projects director al giordino are called away from their current project to assist the environmental protection agency's dr. julie mendoza in an effort to find the source of the poison in what is assumed to be a sunken ship. pitt discovers that the liberty ship pilottown is embedded into the shore of the island with only her stern exposed to the elements. they board her and discover the containers of the nerve agent but while they are attempting to recover the barrels, the volcano on the island erupts, causing the barrels to shift and inadvertently kill dr. mendoza when her biohazard suit is punctured, exposing her to the poison. pitt vows to get to the bottom of who was responsible for the poison being on the ship and to take his revenge for the death of dr. mendoza. in his attempts to trace the history of the pilottown, pitt discovers information on the wreck that leads him to the alhambra iron and boiler company in charleston, south carolina, and from there turns to numa computer expert hiram yaeger and st. julien perlmutter, a family friend and naval historian. they discover that the pilottown has been part of a complicated web of insurance scams and piracy which saw her name changed several times, from san marino to belle chase, and finally to pilottown, as her ownership changed through a number of bogus holding companies. eventually, they tie the ship to bougainville maritime lines, a powerful company owned by the ruthless and mysterious madame min koryo bougainville. bougainville and her grandson, lee tong, have entered into an audacious plan with the soviet union to engineer the kidnapping of the president of the united states, the vice president, the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate, the next three men in the line of succession to the presidency, as part of a project code-named huckleberry finn. it is revealed that the soviet economy is in ruins, a famine is spreading amongst the eastern bloc nations and the whole eastern bloc may be on the verge of collapse. the soviets have devised a plan that calls for the president to undergo a top-secret soviet mind control procedure, termed "mind intervention", which uses a combination of an implanted microchip and injected memories from a brainwashed soviet dissident to allow the soviet government to control the president's thoughts without his knowledge. the other three men are kept in reserve as the procedure only has about a 60% success rate. in return for carrying out the abduction, the bougainvilles are to receive one billion dollars in gold, which the soviets intend to cheat them out of while unaware that the bougainvilles intend to double-cross them as well. when the disappearance of the president (and those next in the line of succession) on the presidential yacht is discovered, secretary of state douglas oates, now the acting president, orders a cover-up of the disappearance while a massive search is under way to find the kidnapped men. congresswoman loren smith, the on again-off again lover of dirk pitt, who is on a fact-finding mission aboard the soviet cruise liner leonid andreyev off the coast of the united states inadvertently witnesses speaker of the house alan moran smuggled onto the ship by a kgb agent. when the soviets discover that smith knows that moran is on board, they kidnap her as well. pitt discovers that loren is missing and he and giordino sneak about the leonid andreyev to find her. but after the bougainvilles detonate a bomb that sinks the ship (part of their double-cross) she is kidnapped by lee tong, disguised as a steward, aboard a rescue boat. meanwhile, the president, now under control of the soviets, returns to the white house and announces that while he was gone, he was negotiating a secret disarmament agreement with the soviet president and has agreed to loan them billions of dollars in hard currency which they may use to purchase food and previously banned american high-technology products. when he further announces his intention to pull the united states out of nato and bring home all troops and missiles in europe without the consent of congress, congress announces their intention to impeach him from office. the president sends the army to keep members of congress from meeting and it appears that the united states now has what the founding fathers feared worst, a dictator in the white house. using information from yaeger and perlmutter, pitt determines that the secret lab the bougainvilles are hiding the remaining captives in is on a barge along the mississippi river near new orleans. he and giordino embark on unauthorized rescue mission with the aid of the local office of the fbi. the agents are ambushed by bougainville's security guards and it's up to pitt and giordino to rescue loren and the vice president. in a last-ditch effort to intercept the barge before it can be sunk at sea, pitt commandeers the riverboat stonewall jackson and enlists the help of 40 members of the sixth louisiana regiment of confederate re-enactors. armed with smooth bore muskets, as well as two napoleon cannons that fire improvised charges, they launch an attack against the bougainville's crew of stone-cold killers armed with automatic weapons, while pitt attempts to board the barge and rescue smith and margolin before it is too late. ||| 6 ||| 5

the story begins in the year 1199, just before the beginning of the fourth crusade. young arthur de caldicot, thirteen years of age at the time, is the second son of a knight living in caldicot manor in the "middle marches" of the march of wales. most of the first book deals with the stresses associated with medieval life. most important to arthur is the fact that he is sir john's second son, and thus ineligible to inherit land. in order to have a life of his own, he must become a squire and then a knight, and create his own manor and farmland. one challenge to overcome is his inadequate "yard-skills", especially jousting and sword-play. he is left-handed, considered a dangerous oddity in those days, but he must joust and fence with his off-hand. another challenge is that his father would make him a scribe for his skill reading and writing. the obstacles disappear when he learns on his fourteenth birthday that his "uncle" sir william de gortanore is really his father; he becomes heir to a large manor. unfortunately, it seems that his mother's husband was murdered by sir william, who was jealous of him. and the revelation terminates the betrothal of arthur and grace, sir william's daughter; as grace is arthur's half-sister they cannot marry. the novel ends with arthur accepted as squire to the lord of the middle marches, stephen de holt, . the wizard merlin gives arthur de caldicot the "seeing stone" early in the story, along with the warning it will cease to work if anyone else shares in its knowledge. through the stone arthur observes the life of legendary king arthur until his rise to power as king of britain. it begins with the marriage of king uther and ygerna. they conceive a child, who is named arthur and is taken by merlin to a foster family. years later, when king uther dies, arthur comes to be king. many specific people look similar to or exactly like people in arthur's life. the most notable resemblance is between arthur and young king arthur himself, which leads de caldicot to suppose that arthur in the stone is himself in the near future. this belief is only accentuated when he learns on his birthday that his parents are only foster parents, as for young king arthur. eventually it becomes clear that king arthur inhabits a parallel universe, with events in both worlds reflecting each other. ||| 2 ||| 2

but when this does not happen, his belief falters. he becomes close friends with one boy; but the friendship breaks up, and he becomes miserable. philip shows considerable academic talent and is informed by the school's headmaster that he could have earned a scholarship for oxford, but instead he becomes determined to leave the school and go to germany. philip's uncle and the headmaster oppose philip's desire to go to germany, but eventually they give in and allow him to go to heidelberg for a year. in heidelberg, philip lives at a boarding house with other foreigners and studies german, among other subjects. philip enjoys his stay in germany. at the boarding house he meets a fellow englishman, hayward, who has an interest in literature and who considers himself a poet. philip also meets an unorthodox american named weeks, who dislikes hayward, whom he thinks superficial. philip is intrigued by his long discourses with hayward and weeks and eventually becomes convinced that he need not believe in the church of england; a radical idea for him as he had been brought up with staunch christian values. philip returns to his uncle's house and meets a middle-aged family friend of his aunt and uncle named miss wilkinson, who is very flirtatious toward philip. he is not particularly attracted to her and is uncomfortable about her age; but he likes the idea of having an affair with someone, so he pursues her. she becomes very attached to philip and declares her love for him, and he pretends to be passionate about her, but he is relieved when she needs to return to berlin. miss wilkinson writes letters to philip from berlin, to which he eventually stops responding. philip's guardians decide to take matters into their own hands and they convince him to move to london to take up an apprenticeship to become a chartered accountant. he does not fare well there as his co-workers resent him because they believe he is above them and is a "gentleman". philip is desperately lonely in london and is humiliated by his lack of aptitude for the work. he begins thinking about studying art in paris. he goes on a business trip with one of his managers to paris and is inspired by this trip. miss wilkinson convinces philip that he draws well enough to become a professional artist, and he moves to paris to study art. in paris, philip attends art classes, makes a few friends among fellow art students and meets miss price, a poor talentless art student who does not get along well with people. miss price falls in love with philip, but he is unaware and does not return her feelings. after her funds run out, she commits suicide, leaving philip to tend to her affairs. philip realizes that he will never be more than a mediocre artist; at the same time, he receives word that his aunt has died. he returns to his uncle's house, and eventually decides to go to london to pursue medicine, his late father's field. he struggles at medical school and comes across mildred, a tawdry waitress at a local café. he falls desperately in love with her, although she does not show any emotion for him. mildred tells philip she is getting married, leaving him heartbroken;

maurice gained it after eating one of the rats, before he was capable of realizing that they were no longer normal rats. the group is not completely happy; the leader of the rats, hamnpork, despises maurice, while dangerous beans (they chose names based on the labels they could read before they could comprehend), a near-blind albino rat who guides them like a guru, wants to start a rat civilization - both he and peaches, the group's scribe, find their trickery unethical. the rats are seeking the ideal of humans and rats living together, following the example of their sacred book mr bunnsy has an adventure. they agree to do one last job, in the town of bad blintz, in überwald. the rats set about planning their offensive, led by darktan, the head of the trap disposal squad, while maurice and keith look around. they are surprised to find that while the buildings are expensively built, the people have little food, and rats are hunted far more viciously than anywhere else. maurice and keith meet malicia, the mayor's daughter, who is a story teller. she soon discovers that maurice can talk, and meets sardines, a tap-dancing rat who is the most daring of the group. while talking to her, maurice reveals that the rat catchers have been passing off bootlaces as rat tails. as they set off to look in the rat-catchers' house, the rats discover many rat tunnels, which are empty, save for traps and poison. the two groups meet in the rat catchers' den, where they have been storing the food the rats are thought to have eaten, and find cages where the rats are being bred for coursing. the rat catchers return, lock keith and malicia away, and take hamnpork to be coursed. maurice hides and feels a voice trying to enter his mind. the rats feel it too, and it returns many of them to being simple rats - to the dismay of dangerous beans. darktan leads a group to rescue hamnpork, while peaches and dangerous beans free keith and malicia. malicia lets slip that mr bunnsy has an adventure is a fictional children's book and dangerous beans and peaches leave in despair. darktan's group is successful in rescuing a severely injured hamnpork, though darktan finds himself in a trap. after a near-death experience, he escapes. hamnpork dies, darktan assumes leadership and sets out after dangerous beans and peaches. maurice gives in to his conscience and is also seeking them, but the voice drowns out his thoughts. malicia and keith, after gaining freedom, trick the rat catchers into revealing their secret. the rat catchers have created a powerful rat king named spider – eight rats, tied together at the tail, who make a single mind with power over others. spider is interested in dangerous beans; other rats he can control, but dangerous beans has a mind similar to his: one that thinks for others. dangerous beans refuses spider's offer of jointly ruling, as spider wants to wage war on humans. spider tries to destroy dangerous beans' mind; this is felt by his army of rats and maurice. dangerous beans is able to resist, but maurice reverts to being a cat, and the cat instinct tells him to pounce... darktan's army, who have been fighting spider's rats, find peaches in spider's lair, which is on fire. maurice emerges from the fire carrying the body of dangerous beans. when he is safely out, he collapses and dies. in ghostly form, he sees the death of rats coming for dangerous beans. he attacks the death of rats to save dangerous beans, but is picked up by death, with whom he strikes a deal, exchanging two of his remaining lives so that death will let dangerous beans live. though spider is defeated, there is still a problem remaining: the rat piper is due to arrive the next day. the rats set about rounding up the 'keekees' (non-intelligent rats). when the piper arrives, keith challenges him to a duel. his pipe was broken by the rat catchers, so keith uses a borrowed trombone in the duel and makes sardines dance. when the piper starts to play his magical pipe, the rats avoid being charmed by keeping their ears stuffed and the keekees can't respond, being locked in their cages. the piper calls keith aside, and tells him the tricks of the trade: the pipe contains a hidden slide position for a trick note that drives rats away, the stories about him are made up so people will be scared into paying. keith and the piper then lead the keekees out of town – keith wants to maintain the story of the piper and the rats want a convenient way to set the keekees free. once that has been done, the rats emerge, offering to tell the humans where to find the stolen food and money, in return for living peacefully with them. keith stays on as the town's piper and the town becomes a tourist attraction where everybody remarks on how 'clean' the place is and marvels at the 'well trained rats'. maurice moves on, being unwilling to settle in one place at a time, and looks to find another human to 'coach'. ||| 0 ||| 2

the book begins hours after the end of the previous novel. honor harrington and her "elysian space navy" arrive at manticoran-controlled space, only to discover that she was believed dead, that her mother had given birth to twins (partly to satisfy the graysons' need for an heir to her steading), her cousin devon has inherited her manticoran title, and that the extent of her injuries will prevent her from returning to active naval duty for a couple of years, since she needs reconstructive surgery. to put honor to good use, the royal manticoran navy promotes her to admiral and places her at saganami island naval academy to teach future generations of naval officers. queen elizabeth iii elevates honor to duchess harrington. meanwhile, honor helps to prove that treecats are as intelligent as humans, and she eventually helps to develop an easy to understand sign language system, making full communication between humans and the treecats possible. after the daring attacks featured in the previous novel, the people's republic of haven seems to have the initiative. however, manticore has a trump card that has the potential to end the war, in the form of devastatingly effective new technology and weapons fully integrated into a new massive heavy assault force, known as 8th fleet. the star kingdom's navy bides time, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. chaos breaks up in the havenite ranks, and the ambitious admiral mcqueen stages a coup that succeeds in killing rob s. pierre and almost all the members of the havenite committee of public safety, except for oscar saint-just who manages to crush the coup by detonating a nuclear device secretly hidden within the navy headquarters. with the committee and the military high command in ruins, saint-just becomes the dictator of the people's republic, and orders admiral thomas theisman to take over the massive fleet guarding haven. this proves to be an eventually fatal miscalculation. while saint-just believes theisman is apolitical and trustworthy, in reality theisman is plotting a coup of his own, with the secret help of the political commissar saint-just has assigned to him. admiral white haven launches manticore's operation buttercup. under his command, 8th fleet begins a lightning offensive deep into havenite territory. the new technology developed by manticore in the prelude to buttercup allows the fleet to quickly demolish all havenite resistance, and in a matter of months manticore becomes poised to invade the haven system itself. in desperation, saint-just attempts to assassinate the manticoran alliance leadership. masadan terrorists in saint-just's service succeed in killing the manticoran prime minister, the duke of cromarty, along with several major figures of the manticoran and grayson governments, despite the efforts of honor harrington. fortunately, honor's actions save queen elizabeth and the protector of grayson benjamin mayhew ix from dying in the same attack. on manticore, cromarty's death opens an opportunity for former opposition factions led by baron high ridge to seize political control, much to the frustration of queen elizabeth. saint-just proposes an immediate cease-fire between manticore and haven. this is hastily accepted by the new high ridge government, despite the fact that 8th fleet is poised to invade haven and force an unconditional surrender. high ridge and his co-partisans in the military come to believe (wrongly) that haven has been defeated for good, and that further violence is not necessary. the new manticoran government institutes programs and policy that will begin a legacy of political greed, selfishness, incompetence, and cronyism that will have far reaching consequences for the entire star kingdom. now secure from the possibility of a manticoran attack on the haven system itself, saint-just turns to internal matters and the consolidation of his grip on power. he orders the arrest of admirals lester tourville and javier giscard, whom he sees as political dissidents. theisman launches his coup. the havenite military under theisman wrests control of the government, and theisman personally executes saint-just. ||| 5 ||| 5
in the novel, a new form of endogenous retrovirus has emerged, sheva. it controls human evolution by rapidly evolving the next generation while in the womb, leading to speciation. the novel follows several characters as the "plague" is discovered as well as the panicked reaction of the public and the u.s. government to the disease. built into the human genome are non-coding sequences of dna called introns. in darwin's radio, certain portions of these "non-sense" sequences, remnants of prehistoric retroviruses, have been activated and are translating numerous lpcs (large protein complexes). the activation of sheva and its consequential sudden speciation was postulated to be either controlled by a complex genetic network that perceives a need for modification or a human adaptive response to overcrowding. the disease, or rather, gene activation, is passed on laterally from male to female as per an std. if impregnated, a woman in her first trimester who has contracted sheva will miscarry a deformed female fetus made of little more than two ovaries. this "first stage fetus" leaves behind a fertilized egg with fifty-two chromosomes rather than the typical forty-six characteristic of homo sapiens sapiens. during the third trimester of the second stage pregnancy, both parents go into a pre-speciation puberty to prepare them for the needs of their novel child. facial pigmentation changes underneath the old skin which begins sloughing off like a mask. vocal organs and olfactory glands alter and sensitize respectively, to adapt for a new form of communication. for over a year after the first sheva outbreak in the united states, no second stage fetus was recorded to have been born alive. the new human species was highly sensitive to all varieties of herpes and could not be viably born to a mother who had ever been infected with any of the virus' many forms, including epstein-barr and the chickenpox — thus eliminating 95% of the female population. anesthetics and pitocin administered during childbirth were also lethal. so while many women would contract activated sheva, few would be able to successfully give birth, making the transition from homo sapiens sapiens to the new human species very gradual. the international response to the threat of sheva was to form a special task force that would work alongside the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) to find a vaccine. because the "disease", called "herod's flu", was already in the genome of every person on earth, the only two options were to either inhibit the activation of the sheva gene by discovering the signal it used or to abort the second stage fetus. due to the rapid mutation rate of the missing-link signal molecule, preventing the activation of the gene was infeasible. the second option, abortion, was already a controversial issue and the proposal of handing out free ru 486 was met with social upheaval, adding to the already chaotic social scene. the general public believed that the government was either not placing due importance on the death of countless fetuses, or already had a cure and refused to release it. in response, government research facilities were forced to test prospective treatments prematurely and could not pursue explanations for sheva outside of the "disease" category because of the potential reactions from the masses. it was not until viable second stage fetuses were born that the idea of sheva being a part of evolution rather than a disease began to grow from a few isolated sources. ||| 5 ||| 4
rayford, filled with rage over so many losses, contemplates killing nicolae carpathia. he is so obsessed with the idea that he becomes stern and short tempered at times. at the new babylon palace, david hassid is placed in charge of delivering 144 computers to nicolae, but diverts the delivery by telling the pilots delivering the computers to go one place and does the paperwork for another location. floyd charles reveals that he was infected from delivering hattie's stillborn child and goes to the hospital where leah rose works. while on the run from gc forces, floyd charles succumbs to the poison and dies. the international co-op is up and running, which will allow believers to trade when it becomes illegal to buy and sell without the mark of the beast. rayford is still wondering if he might be the one to kill nicolae. hattie (who also wants to kill nicolae) runs off after an incident with floyd and rayford goes to find her, only to be tricked by gc forces. hattie is imprisoned and taken to the belgium facility for female rehabilitation, or "buffr". rayford and the newest member of the trib force, leah, are trying to retrieve a large quantity of cash from leah's safe when the sixth trumpet judgment hits as prophesied in revelation 9:13-19, where a plague of death by fire, smoke, sulphur and deadly snake strikes carried out by 200 million demonic horsemen, visible only to the tribulation saints, attack nonbelievers. ray and leah run into gc peacekeeping forces and the horsemen, heading back to the safe house with the cash as the peacekeepers are killed. david hassid meanwhile successfully gets the computers incorrectly delivered. he also introduces the condor cargo chief and his love interest, annie christopher, to mac. an assassination attempt on nicolae ends up destroying the condor 216; it is soon replaced by pontifex maximus peter matthews's plane and renamed the phoenix 216. the gc plans a gala for the midpoint of the tribulation in jerusalem. the tribulation hurtles to its midpoint as the four murders prophesied in scripture take place. peter matthews is murdered by the 10 sub-pontentates of the world. carpathia personally kills the two witnesses with a gun similar to the one rayford buys to kill him. the witnesses later protagonize a dramatic resurrection as they are taken up into the clouds, which is dismissed by the media as a hoax. after they are resurrected, an earthquake breaks out, destroying one tenth of israel and leaving seven thousand dead, as prophesied in revelation 11:11-13. finally, carpathia himself is assassinated as prophesied in revelation 13:3-4 while delivering a speech three days before the midpoint of the tribulation. rayford is skeptical as to whether he really was the one who did the deed as he planned to. a hole in carpathia's head is the same size that rayford would expect his gun to make, but he was bumped from behind a split second before pulling the trigger. and there were several people near him who are just as suspect. in a brief flashforward to the day before the pontentate's burial, it is revealed that the assassin was caught on video camera and david hassid is clearly surprised by what the tape reveals. ||| 2 ||| 6

it is 1936. lord and lady peter wimsey, returned from a european honeymoon, are settling into their new home in london, where daily life is affected by the illness and then death of the king. the couple are personally happy, having resolved many of the problems in their relationship caused by character and circumstance, but must now tackle the practical details of bringing their lives together, including domestic and working arrangements, and social and family obligations. the couple become slightly acquainted with laurence harwell, a wealthy theatrical "angel", and his beautiful wife, whom he has rescued from poverty following her rich father's disgrace and imprisonment. after two years' marriage the harwells are famously still devoted to one another, and when she is found dead at their weekend cottage in the country wimsey is asked to help interview the distraught husband, and becomes involved with the investigation. (he is also asked to undertake sensitive diplomatic duties connected with the problematic behaviour of the new king, and as the 1936 abdication crisis looms, he gloomily predicts the coming war with hitler's germany.) suspicion falls on a writer known to have been in love with mrs harwell, and a talented but bohemian painter who had been working on portraits of both harriet and the murdered woman. two men who knew mrs harwell's father in prison, and who have been blackmailing him with threats to harm her, are also suspected. meanwhile harriet straightens out her domestic situation, learning how to fulfill her new role whilst keeping her own identity, and finds a practical solution to allow wimsey's devoted manservant bunter to marry without having to leave the household. harriet's unorthodox approach infuriates her sister-in-law (who believes harriet has an obligation to abandon her career, do her duty to the family and produce an heir) but it allows her to solve most of the practical difficulties that might have stood in the way of a successful and happy marriage. she also discovers she is expecting a baby. after some plot twists, a second murder and a scene involving the hidden rivers and victorian sewers that run under london, it is revealed that harwell unintentionally killed his wife in a jealous rage, in the belief she was preparing to entertain a lover, although ironically her preparations had really been for him. harwell might have gotten off with a manslaughter conviction, but except that he later committed the premeditated murder of an actress who was in a position to disprove his alibi and tried to blackmail him. harriet visits harwell in prison to comfort him with the knowledge that his wife had not, after all, been unfaithful. in doing so, she finally banishes the lingering ghosts of her own imprisonment and murder trial, and the effect they have had on her relationship with her own husband. ||| 6 ||| 6

while serving a sentence for killing his foster mother – a crime he insisted he didn't commit – jacko argyle dies in prison. two years later, the man who could have supported jacko's alibi suddenly turns up; and the family must come to terms with the fact not only that one of them is the real murderer, but also that suspicion falls upon each of them. christie's focus in this novel is upon the psychology of innocence, as the family members struggle with their suspicions of one another. the witness, arthur calgary, believes that, when he clears the name of their son, the family would be grateful. he fails to realise the implications of his information. however, once he does so, he is determined to help and to protect the innocent by finding the murderer. to be able to do so, he visits the retired local doctor, dr macmaster, to ask him about the now-cleared murderer, jacko argyle. dr macmaster states that he was surprised when jacko killed his mother. not because he thought that murder was outside jacko's 'moral range', but because he thought jacko would be too cowardly to kill somebody himself; that, if he wanted to murder somebody, he would egg on an accomplice to do his dirty work. dr macmaster says "the kind of murder i'd have expected jacko to do, if he did one, was the type where a couple of boys go out on a raid; then, when the police come after them, the jackos say 'biff him on the head, bud. let him have it. shoot him down.' they're willing for murder, ready to incite to murder, but they've not got the nerve to do murder themselves with their own hands". this description seems to be a reference to the craig and bentley case which had occurred in 1952. ||| 6 ||| 6

the book opens with a boy called jarred, a friend of prince endon. after the death of king alton and his queen, endon is proclaimed king in his father's place. to consummate this, a magical steel belt, the belt of deltora, is set around endon's waist. the belt recognises endon as deltora's rightful king. jarred, curious, goes to the library and learns that the evil shadow lord, a sauron-like intelligence located in the shadowlands, once tried to seize the land in which is the kingdom of deltora. because the people of those days were divided into seven tribes, the shadow army soon overwhelmed much of the land. jarred learned that a blacksmith named adin gathered the sacred talismans from each tribe and attached them to a chain of steel medallions. the people's trust in adin, channeled through the gems, was powerful enough to drive back the shadow army into its own dark home, the shadowlands. adin later became king of the united land called deltora; yet he never forgot that the enemy was not destroyed. he therefore never let the belt out of his sight. with every generation, the belt was worn less and less, diminishing its effect. the kings and queens also let their power go to the administrative council, diminishing its power. jarred, learning of this, urges endon to put on the belt and revive the custom of adin. before he can explain in detail, chief advisor prandine enters and accuses jarred of treason. jarred escapes prandine and finds that the city has fallen into disrepair, and deltora has become a virtual dystopia. jarred then becomes apprentice and successor to crian the blacksmith, later to marry crian's granddaughter anna. seven years later, the gems of deltora were stolen by the ak-baba under the shadow lord and was scattered throughout the land. this also allowed the enemy to enter the land. jarred helps king endon and queen sharn (endon's pregnant bride) escape the invasion through a secret tunnel. sixteen years later, the shadow lord tyrannically rules deltora. a person identified as jarred's son and apprentice, lief, has been born during this time. he has been raised to reject the shadow lord, but never to show any obvious opposition. on his birthday, lief's father sends his son, accompanied by a soldier named barda, to find the lost gems from the belt and restore them to it. the nearest gem, the golden topaz, is to be found in mid wood, which is one of three perilous forests of silence. while travelling to the forest, wenns capture them and take them into first wood as an offering to the predator known as wennbar. before being eaten, a forest-dwelling girl of lief's own age, called jasmine appears. jasmine, after a brief reluctance, rescues lief and barda, later to leads them to the dark in the heart of mid wood. there, they discover a wall made of steadfastly cultivated vines, enclosing a clearing in the very center of the forest. in that center grow three flowers called the lilies of life, whose nectar possesses healing properties. the wall of vines was guarded by a jalis knight called gorl, who sought to drink of the nectar of life and become immortal. over the years, gorl's body has rotted away, leaving nothing behind but his memories and his intentions. he captures lief and barda. under their questions, gorl narrates all, while barda strives to break the psychokinetic control held by the knight over the questers' bodies. barda breaks the grip, but is given a mortal wound by gorl's sword. as he is about to kill lief, jasmine persuades a tree to drop a limb onto gorl, thus destroying him and breaching his wall. sunlight enters the dark, and the lilies of life bloom at last. jasmine and lief use their nectar to heal the dying barda. as the lilies fade, jasmine takes the last of the nectar into a jar, so that she might use it on future injuries. lief takes the topaz from its position as the pommel of gorl's sword and fits it into the belt of deltora. the three relax and recuperate, while animals from all over mid wood enter the breach in gorl's wall and devour the vines. later, barda and lief re-embark, with jasmine and her companions kree & filli in company. ||| 0 ||| 2
the son of neptune begins with the amnesiac percy jackson being chased by the two remaining gorgon sisters, who want to kill him to avenge the death of their sister medusa. percy, who has no memories of his past life except of his girlfriend, annabeth chase, manages to outdistance them and stumbles upon juno, disguised as an old lady, who gives him two options: to carry her to the caldecott tunnel, into the roman camp and across the little tiber river—though she warns him that by crossing through the river he'll lose his achilles-like invulnerability—or to retreat to the safety of the sea and live a long, happy life. percy chooses to carry juno in hopes of seeing annabeth again. at the caldecott tunnel he meets two other demigods: hazel levesque and frank zhang. when they cross the river, percy sees frank get caught by the pursuing gorgons and controls the river to destroy them. juno then reveals herself to the people there, who are inhabitants of camp jupiter, the roman camp for demigods. percy is accepted by the camp's praetor, a girl named reyna, and is made part of the fifth cohort when hazel sponsors him. he and hazel and frank then prepare for the night's war games. during the games, the trio is responsible for the cohort's victory, and after the games mars appears. he claims frank as his son and sends percy, hazel, and frank on a quest to free thanatos, the god of death, who is imprisoned in alaska. on the quest, they bump into an old man named phineas, who is all-knowing and all-seeing. he tells them that he will reveal the location of thanatos if they capture a harpy named ella and bring her to him. before capturing ella, they learn that she can memorize anything she reads and decide to gamble with phineas instead. phineas and percy will each drink a vial of gorgon blood, one of which kills while the other heals. phineas ends up dying and the trio discover the location in phineas's pocket: hubbard glacier in alaska. on the way to alaska, hazel reveals that she was actually supposed to be dead but was rescued from the fields of asphodel by nico di angelo and that seventy years prior to the story she was originally started to wake up the giant alcyoneus but stopped him from rising the day he was due to escape. at that point, frank reveals to hazel that his life depends on a piece of firewood that he always keeps. when it burns out, he dies. when they finally reach the glacier, they find the roman camp's eagle standard and most importantly, thanatos in chains. his chains cannot be broken unless melted by the "fire of life", a.k.a frank's firewood, so frank starts melting the chains as hazel attacks alcyoneus, while percy attacks alcyoneus's ghost legion. frank manages to free thanatos with just a bit of his firewood left. frank then goes to help hazel and learns how to use his family power, which is shape shifting into any animal. he attacks alcyoneus and dazes him, while percy slams his sword at the edge of the iceberg where he was fighting, collapsing the iceberg and drowning the ghost legion. frank and hazel then drag alcyoneus across the border into canada, where hazel kills him. frank and hazel meet back up with percy in alaska and then the trio rush back to camp jupiter, where, with the help of tyson, mrs. o'leary, and the roman legion they fend off the giant polybotes's army. after seeing the eagle standard, the legion regains their hope and fights with renewed energy. percy then challenges the giant polybotes (born to oppose poseidon) to a duel, as the rest of the camp fights the rest of the monsters. percy calls to terminus to help him defeat the giant, as giants can only be defeated by both a god and demigod. percy eventually beats polybotes after a battle using the head of terminus' statue as a weapon. after the battle the legion names percy as praetor, one of the two leaders of the roman camp. nearing the end, the groups of greek camp demigods inform percy of their arrival through a video scroll. he persuades the senate to trust him and let them in without a fight since the future of the world depends on both groups. percy then resolves to introduce hazel and frank to his other family. ||| 7 ||| 2
three things happen to kinsey millhone on her thirty-third birthday: she moves into her remodelled apartment, which has finally been finished; she is hired by irene gersh, a sickly santa theresa resident, to head out to the slabs in the mojave desert and locate her mother; she gets the news that tyrone patty, a particularly dangerous criminal she helped the carson city police department track down a few years back, has hired a hitman to kill her. after her first night in her new place, kinsey heads out early the next day in search of mrs gersh's mother, agnes grey, who lives in a trailer in the desert. agnes isn't home, and the trailer seems to be occupied by two teenage runaways, but kinsey eventually tracks agnes down at a local convalescent hospital, where she has been since being taken suddenly ill on a trip to a local town sometime before. agnes, 83 years old, hasn't exactly been a model patient, and the hospital staff are delighted to hear that she has relatives who can take responsibility for her. irene makes plans to transfer agnes to a facility in santa teresa, but agnes seems terrified of going there, and tells kinsey a confused story about a number of people from the past, including lottie, and emily who died. kinsey makes plans to come home, but before she can do so, a man in a pick-up truck deliberately runs her off the road, seriously injuring kinsey and totalling her treasured vw. kinsey recognises the driver as a man she has seen travelling with his young son a couple of times on the journey to the slabs, and realises she needs to take the death threat against her seriously. she hires robert dietz, the pi who helped her briefly by phone in a is for alibi, as a bodyguard. his vigilance initially frustrates kinsey, used to making her own decisions, but they soon begin an affair. dietz discovers the hitman is mark messinger, who absconded with his son, eric, eight months previously. he arranges a meeting with the child's mother, rochelle, who is desperate to get her son back, and offers to help her. meanwhile agnes goes missing only a few hours after getting to santa teresa, and although she is soon found, she is dead within a day - of fright, according to the pathologist - and they suspect she has been kept prisoner somewhere. irene suffers a serious panic reaction when she sees a tea set kinsey found amongst her mother's possessions, and kinsey suspects this has triggered a buried childhood memory. further anomalies occur when irene tries to fill in the paperwork relating to the death: kinsey realises that irene's birth certificate is faked, and that agnes grey is a pseudonym. it's kinsey's cfi colleague darcy who points out agnes grey is the name of a novel by anne brontë, which seems to link to the names emily and lottie (charlotte) agnes had mentioned. she tracks down a family called bronfen who match the circumstances agnes described, and surmises that the surviving brother of the family, patrick, murdered lottie and emily. she is convinced that agnes grey was anne bronfen, a third sister, who took off with irene to protect her when patrick killed irene's mother, sheila, changing their identities and posing as her mother. the three daughters were presumably named for the brontë sisters, which explains the alias anne chose to use. patrick faked anne's death in order to gain sole possession of the family property. kinsey is convinced that patrick is responsible for agnes's death, to cover his past crimes, and discovers evidence of further killings at his home. when she confronts patrick, she is interrupted by messinger, who kills patrick. dietz and rochelle have managed to get eric away from messinger, and messinger's stated intention is to use kinsey as a hostage to exchange for eric. as she drives messinger to the airport at gunpoint to intercept rochelle, kinsey is convinced messinger will kill them all. however, rochelle outsmarts messinger and kills him first. ||| 6 ||| 6
giovanni is a boy from a poor family, working hard to feed his sick mother (who has contracted an unnamed disease). because of this, he never has any free time and is ridiculed by his peers, leaving him as somewhat of a social outcast. his kindly friend, campanella, is the only one (apart from his mother and his sister, both of whom are never actually seen) who cares for him. at school, in a science class, the teacher asks giovanni what the milky way really is. giovanni knows that they are stars, but cannot answer. the teacher asks campanella, but he intentionally does not answer to save giovanni from even more ridicule from his peers. during class, the local bully, zanelli, says that giovanni has been so absent-minded because his father has yet to come back from an expedition to the far north. zanelli claims that giovanni's father was arrested (because the trip was supposedly "illegal"), which angers giovanni. before he can give zanelli a good punch, the bell rings, marking the end of the class. the teacher, after encouraging the students to attend the star festival occurring that night, lets everyone leave. giovanni, however, stays behind to chat with the teacher. after class, the teacher (another of giovanni's friends) and giovanni marvel at the fossils that giovanni's father brought back from his expeditions. the teacher asks giovanni if his father is back yet (this question is asked repeatedly throughout the story). giovanni responds no, and heads home to begin another long, lonely night of work at the local paper. on that night (which marks a large festival), giovanni runs into zanelli. he makes fun of giovanni, mocking him about an otter fur coat his father would give him when he comes back, and runs away to the festival. giovanni can not go to the festival, because he has to take care of his mother, and do the chores that his sister did not. tired after a hard day's work, giovanni lies down on top of a hill. he hears a strange sound, and finds himself in the path of a train. luckily, the train stops. he gets on board, as does campanella. giovanni notices that campanella is all wet. giovanni asks why, and campanella says he's not sure, but a flashback that shows him drowning suggests otherwise. the train travels through the northern cross and other stars in the milky way. along the way, the two see fantastic sights and meet various people: for example, scholars excavating a fossil from white sands of crystal and a man who catches herons to make candies from them. children who were on a ship that crashed into an iceberg (possibly titanic) get on the train at aquila, suggesting that the train is transporting its passengers to their afterlife. the train arrives at the southern cross and all the other passengers get off the train, leaving only giovanni and campanella in the train. giovanni promises campanella to go on forever, together. but as the train approaches the coalsack, campanella disappears, leaving giovanni behind. giovanni wakes up on top of the hill. he heads to the town, and finds out that zanelli fell into the river from a boat. he was saved by campanella who went into the water, but campanella had not come up since then and is missing. worried, giovanni heads toward the river, in fear of what he already knows. his worries prove true, because campanella has been under the water for a long duration of time, meaning he is dead. on the verge of tears, giovanni tries to stay strong. campanella's father (who didn't notice giovanni at first) asks giovanni to have his classmates come over to his home, after school tomorrow (for reasons unknown, though it seems likely that they are being called in for a formal funeral). giovanni then makes a promise to stay strong throughout life, claiming that, no matter where he is, he and campanella will always be together. he then heads home, to deliver milk to his mother. ||| 2 ||| 0

brock recalls his days at the university of california, berkeley and how he was turned off by hecklers at a speech by then united states ambassador to the united nations, jeane kirkpatrick. brock's main attraction to conservatism was his disdain for communism. after college, brock moved with his then-partner (called "andrew" to conceal his identity) to washington, d.c. in d.c., brock worked for the washington times and the american spectator. brock claims while he was working for those publications he thought he was doing honest journalism, but later stated that he had never corroborated his facts. while working for the american spectator, he wrote an article on anita hill, which he later expanded into the real anita hill, a book that made him popular in the conservative movement. brock would later say that many of the details he used were false. after bill clinton was elected, brock was assigned to write a story, later dubbed troopergate, about four arkansas state troopers who held a grudge against bill clinton. he claims that the troopers made up stories about affairs that could never be corroborated. brock was given assurances that the troopers would not get paid for telling their stories. he later discovered he was deceived and that the troopers had been paid by richard mellon scaife, who bankrolled the american spectator and the arkansas project, a secret project to discredit clinton. brock made sure to conceal the identities of the women identified by the troopers, with the exception of one woman named "paula". brock thought that by not revealing her last name, it would be enough to conceal her identity. brock did not take into account that little rock is a small city. eventually her identity would be revealed as paula jones, which led to her civil lawsuit against bill clinton. following the troopergate story, brock wrote a book about hillary clinton, the seduction of hillary rodham. unlike the anita hill book, brock decided not to put anything in the book that he could not corroborate. the book was not as critical of hillary clinton as it was promised to be. brock claims that conservatives planned on the book being so damning as to influence the outcome of the 1996 presidential election. the seduction of hillary rodham was the beginning of brock's falling out with the conservative movement. the issue that forced him to leave the conservative movement was the movement's intolerance towards homosexuality. brock had reluctantly come out of the closet prior to writing the hillary clinton book, and believes this contributed to his being shunned by many in the movement. brock voted for al gore in 2000, the first time he voted since he voted for ronald reagan in 1984. during the period in which he did not vote, he had two rationalizations for his non-voting: * he believed that his vote didn't count in liberal washington d.c. * he believed that not voting allowed him to stay neutral brock proclaimed that the latter rationalization was bogus, as he was not neutral during that time period. ||| 4 ||| 4
we meet first dr petrie who is immediately surprised by a late night visitor, “a tall, lean ... square cut ... sun baked” man who turns out to be his good friend (commissioner sir denis) nayland smith of burma, formerly of scotland yard, who has come directly from burma. we then learn that various men associated with india are the target of assassination by the chinese dr fu manchu, who seems to have been active in burma (as distinct from india), in places such as rangoon, prome, moulmein and the “upper irrawaddy”, and who comes to england with dacoits and thuggees. fu manchu is pursued from the opium dens of limehouse in the east end of london to various country estates. we learn that dr fu manchu is a leading member not of “old china”, the mandarin class of the manchu dynasty, or “young china”, a new generation of “youthful and unbalanced reformers” with “western polish” - but a “third party”. nayland smith is outwitted several times by fu manchu, and thus he reflects more the narrow escapes of the later bulldog drummond rather than the “logical” superior approach of the earlier sherlock holmes. fu manchu is a master poisoner and chemist, a cunning member of the yellow peril, “the greatest genius which the powers of evil have put on the earth for centuries”, though his mission is not exactly clear at this stage. he appears to be trying to capture and take back to china the best engineers of europe, for some larger criminal purpose. by the end of the book, fu manchu’s slave karamaneh, a beautiful arab woman, apparently now in love with dr petrie, and her brother aziz, are freed, and inspector weymouth, driven mad by an injection of serum from fu manchu, is restored to sanity by fu manchu, who appears to have escaped from a fire which destroys the house he had previously entered. ||| 1 ||| 2
on the demonic twelfth plane the demon zdim is drafted for a year's indentured servitude on the human prime plane, the demon society having an agreement to provide service to human sorcerers in return for supplies of iron, a raw material it desperately needs. zdim is duly summoned to the prime plane by the sorcerer dr. maldivius of novaria. there he strives to do his duty, but his demonic literal-mindedness hampers him. assigned to protect the sibylline sapphire from any trespassers, he promptly eats maldivius' apprentice grax when the latter intrudes. similar misadventures result in the disgusted maldivius selling his contract, and the demon is passed from one master to another, from circus master bagardo to the rich widow roska of ir, all the while doing his level best to figure out what the muddled humans truly wish of him. against all odds he becomes a hero when he recruits aid for the city-state of ir after it discounts intelligence of an imminent invasion by the cannibal paaluans. returning to his home plane early and with extra iron, he resolves never again to leave the comforts of the twelfth plane — until he realizes how dull it is compared with the picturesque insanity of the human realm... by internal chronology, the fallible fiend is the second story in the novarian series, coming after the short story "the emperor's fan", which is set centuries before the others, and prior to the reluctant king trilogy. (the paaluan invasion of ir is mentioned in the second and third books of the trilogy, the clocks of iraz and the unbeheaded king, respectively, as an event occurring either recently or some generations past.) note: the name of ir, the subterrranean city-state where much the plot takes place, is simply the hebrew word for "city" (עיר). ||| 2 ||| 2

the book concerns the mysterious disappearance of the president of the united states, who was facing a serious political crisis, perhaps even impeachment, over his handling of a foreign situation, namely the impending war (what we would now call world war ii). the disappearance of the president seems like a kidnapping, but no ransom is demanded. although not revealed in detail until near the end, it is fairly apparent from an early stage that the president has staged his own disappearance to counter an impending military coup staged by an upstart army of fascist "grey shirts" allied with a small coterie of industrialists (similar to the business plot). the aim of all this is to involve the united states in a european war when none of the combatants has attacked american territory. ||| 6 ||| 5

the primary plot of the novel is the struggle of sandrilene fa toren, a half-namornese noblewoman, against her cousin, empress berenene of namorn; sandry had inherited the vast namornese estate of landreg from her mother, who had accustomed her to receiving a yearly income from the estate while rarely visiting it. empress berenene, who wants to keep the revenue from the estate within namorn, repeatedly invites sandry to visit her court in dancruan while levying increasing taxes from her estate. when sandry realizes that the empress has been threatening namorn's amicable trade with emelan, she decides to accept the empress's invitation and use the visit to visit her estate and namornese family. sandry's uncle, duke vedris of emelan, asks her childhood companions daja kisubo, trisana chandler and briar moss who have just come back from their travels to accompany her in lieu of a company of guards, a gesture both discourteous and ineffectual. though their friendship with sandry and with each other has become strained since their return to summersea after years of world-traveling, daja, tris and briar agree, and the four travel to namorn together. while there, they learn of the western namornese custom of bride kidnapping, which entails a man kidnapping a prospective bride and holding her captive until she agrees to sign a wedding contract. while the so-called "horse's rump" wedding is usually only used to bypass reluctant families or out of a sense of adventure, some marriages are forced, and the custom remains legal. empress berenene has never attempted to illegalize it despite having twice been kidnapped, because she believes her ability to escape both times means that only weak women would allow themselves to be forced into a marriage they don't want. when he hears of this, briar comments that the empress's captors are unlikely to have used the same level of violence as a common woman might encounter. because of their power and renown, empress berenene decides that namorn stands to benefit if she persuades all four mages to remain in her court, in addition to sandry and the funds from her namornese estate. she offers tris a position as a court mage with a large salary and benefits including access to the imperial library, attempting to appeal to her merchant upbringing and her known bibliophily. she appeals to briar by inviting him to her fantastic private greenhouses, offering him unlimited access as her personal gardener and showing him public favor, including an earldom. to entice sandry to remain in court, she sends an entourage of four young nobles to escort her to clehamat landreg, including finlach fer hurich and jakuben fer pennun, who openly compete in their courtship of sandry. daja develops a relationship with berenene's beautiful seamstress, rizuka fa dalach, which is encouraged by the empress in order to keep daja in namorn. when fin, frustrated by sandry's reluctance, kidnaps her with the aid of his uncle, locking her in a magic-proof box in the julih tunnel, a secret part of the castle, sandry reconnects her magical bond with briar while he is at a dance with caidy, calling out to him for help. briar and tris succeed in extracting sandry, and they decide to leave namorn despite empress berenene's efforts to dissuade them and the incarceration of fin and his uncle, until then the head of the dancruan mages' society. the empress then orders ishabal ladyhammer, her most powerful war-mage, to prevent the four from leaving to save face, and ishabal casts a curse on tris, causing her to fall down the stairs and fracture most of her bones. the injured tris insists that sandry, daja and briar travel ahead of her, and she catch up to them when she recovers. halfway to the border with anderran sandry is again kidnapped, this time by pershan fer roth, whose proposal of marriage she had refused shortly before leaving dancruan, and quenaill shieldsman, a powerful court mage and shan's rival for the empress's attentions. quen lays a powerful sleeping spell on briar and daja and magic-dampening spells on sandry. briar uses smelling salts he calls "wake the dead" to wake up daja and they start to go after sandry when they are confronted by quenaill. briar and daja engage quenaill, draining him until the spells on sandry wear off. when sandry wakes up, she is covered in charms to prevent her from using her magic. these charms are tied to her with ribbons and she is thus able to free herself. sandry then uses thread magic to unravel her captors' clothing and cocoon them in the resulting threads. after meeting up with daja and briar again, the party continue to the border. aware that the empress may attempt to stop them, they send ahead their traveling companions and send their guards home. at the border, they are confronted by ishabal ladyhammer. she raises a barrier against them, but sandry uses the circle of thread that binds them together to combine their powers. tris, who had been travelling behind, magically accesses the ring from a distance, allowing the four mages to use their amplified power to shatter the border barrier. the thread circle disappears and all four now have a circular lump in their hand. having invested much of her power in the barrier, ishabal is magically drained when she leaves without attempting to stop tris from crossing. the original title of the novel, the circle reforged, refers to the reforging of the four protagonists' friendship. in the year of the circle of magic quartet, sandry, tris, daja and briar live together and develop a strong friendship that manifests itself magically as a bond that allows them to communicate telepathically and causes their magical abilities to cross over from one to another. in the circle opens the four are separated, although their bond is clarified when they refer to each other as siblings or foster-siblings. sandry remains in summersea, living with her uncle in the ducal citadel, while briar, daja and tris travel the world with their respective teachers. when they return, daja after two years and tris and briar after four, the experiences they had while apart lead them to close their mental connection to each other, a representation of the distancing of their relationship. sandry, feeling betrayed first by having been left behind, then by the telepathic wall, reciprocates in the same manner. throughout the first few chapters of the book the four mages fight frequently. briar and tris are invited by daja to live in her new house, with tris taking over housekeeping duties to assuage what she perceives as charity from her wealthier friends. daja withholds the extent of her hurt at not being able to return to winding circle as well as her experiences with the arsonist ben ladradun during cold fire. tris lies about her newly learned ability to scry on the wind because of the ill treatment she experienced from other mages who found out. briar refuses to discuss his experiences of war in gyongxe and his resulting post-traumatic stress disorder with anyone but rosethorn, his teacher and traveling companion. sandry and daja are the first to reopen their mental connection, ending their estrangement. later in the book, briar and tris open their connection with each other. some time later, sandry telepathically calls out to tris and briar when she's trapped in a box, nearly paralyzed by spells that bind her magic and her own fear of the dark. eventually, their telepathic bond is completely restored, though they maintain their ability to screen their minds when they choose to. the bond, and the circle of thread that represents it, serve them in a joint magical working to breach the barrier on the namorn-anderran border during the book's climactic battle; once complete, sandry finds the thread gone, and each of them is left with a scar on their right palm resembling the four lumps in the thread that had represented their magical identities. in the post-climactic scene, each of the four reveals the secret that they had been keeping, and briar introduces his sisters to a mental recreation of discipline cottage, their former home, which he had created and used when he wanted to feel safe. the will of the empress is the first book set in emelan to involve the protagonists in a romantic sub-plot. while previous books alluded to romantic relationships between the adult characters, none of the four main characters were shown to have romantic interests. sandry's visit to namorn is punctuated by empress berenene's desire to see her marry a namornese nobleman. she is courted by jak and fin, whose advances she rebuffs while maintaining a friendly acquaintance with them. she develops feeling for shan and responds to his less public courtship, but when she learns that he's sexually involved with empress berenene, she doesn't pursue the relationship and rejects his offer of marriage. after fin's incarceration jak learns that sandry is leaving namorn and visits her before she leaves, when she tells him that she enjoys his company much more as a friend than as a suitor. daja meets rizu, the empress's mistress of wardrobe, developing an infatuation with her and commenting on her beauty and flirtatiousness. her feelings remain unacknowledged until rizu makes the first move and kisses her, resulting in awkwardness on the part of sandry, who telepathically senses the kiss and is flustered by the rush of daja's emotions while dancing with fin. daja and rizu's relationship quickly becomes sexual, and is discovered by briar when he finds rizu in daja's bedroom one morning naked. during their short relationship, daja develops intense feelings for rizu and shows a desire for her to be accepted as part of her siblings' inner circle, while they are reluctant. when daja prepares to leave namorn she asks rizu to return to emelan with her and is heartbroken by her refusal; during the ride to the border she's shown to carry a small portrait of rizu in her pouch. after daja leaves, berenene comments on rizu's low spirits since her lover's departure. briar, coping with an unspecified war in the country of yanjing, tends to romance as many women as he can, mainly caidy. he reassures the others that he takes droughtwort, a plant that renders the eater temporarily sterile. he has vivid nightmares of the war in gyongxe when he sleeps alone. ||| 2 ||| 2
captain hastings arrives in the flat that he now shares with poirot in london, eager to tell the belgian detective about a woman with whom he has fallen hopelessly in love on the train from paris to calais. but poirot is busy sorting his mail, impatiently tossing aside bills and banal requests "recovering lost lap dogs for fashionable ladies". then he finds an extraordinary letter from the south of france: "for god's sake, come!" writes monsieur paul renauld. poirot decides to investigate and he takes hastings to france and the villa genevieve in merlinville-sur-mer on the northern french coast where renauld wrote from. asking for directions near the villa genevieve, they are watched by a young girl outside another smaller villa who has "anxious eyes". arriving at renauld's house, they find they are too late: renauld is dead. he and his wife were attacked in their rooms at 2.00 in the night by two masked men. madame renauld was tied up and her husband taken away by the men wanting to know "the secret". they appear to have got in to the house through the open front door with no sign of forced entry. his body was found stabbed in a newly dug open grave on the edge of a nearby golf course which is under construction and next to the placing of a bunker which was due to be dug that day. the renaulds' son, jack, had just been sent away on business to south america and renauld also gave the chauffeur an unexpected holiday leaving just three female servants in the house who heard nothing. the eldest of the three servants tells poirot and the police that quite often, after madame renauld has retired to bed for the night, her husband has been visited by a neighbour, madame daubreuil, who is the mother of the girl with the "anxious eyes", marthe daubreuil. the dead man changed his will just two weeks before, leaving almost everything to his wife and nothing to his son. there is a smashed watch at the scene of the kidnap which is still running but has somehow gained two hours. the widow inspects the body to identify it. she loses her composure and collapses with grief at the sight of her dead husband. poirot is puzzled by some of these findings—why is the watch running fast? why did the servants hear nothing? why was the body found somewhere where it was bound to be quickly discovered? why is there a piece of lead piping near the body? poirot is hampered in his investigations by the attitude of monsieur giraud of the sûreté who plainly believes the elderly belgian is too set in his old-fashioned ways to solve the mystery. the local examining magistrate, monsieur hautet, is more helpful and tells poirot that he has found out that the renaulds' neighbour at the villa marguerite, madame daubreuil, has paid two hundred thousand francs into her bank account in recent weeks: was she monsieur renauld's mistress? they visit the lady who is furious when the suggestion is put to her and throws them out. having now met madame daubreuil for the first time, poirot tells hastings that he recognises her from a murder case going back some twenty years. soon after, jack renauld arrives back; his trip to santiago was delayed enabling him to return when he heard of his father's murder. jack admits to rowing with his father over who he wanted to marry, hence the change of will. poirot suspects that marthe daubreuil is the girl in question and feels that the answer to the problem lies in paris. he goes there to investigate. whilst he is away another body is found in a shed on the golf course. no one recognises the man who by his hands could be a tramp but is dressed in finer clothes. the strangest thing is that the man has been dead for forty-eight hours and thus died before monsieur renauld's murder. no one recognises the new corpse. poirot returns from paris and, without being told details beforehand, staggers hastings by correctly guessing the age of the man, place of death, and manner of death, despite having been clearly shocked when hastings originally told him of this new development. he examines the new corpse with the doctor. poirot sees foam on his lips and the doctor realises the man died of an epileptic fit and was then stabbed after death. when alone, poirot tells hastings that his investigations in paris have borne fruit and that madame daubreuil is in fact a madame beroldy who was put on trial twenty years previously for the death of her elderly husband. he too was murdered by, supposedly, two masked men who broke into their house at night wanting to know "the secret". madame beroldy had a young lover, georges conneau, who absconded from justice but wrote a letter to the police admitting to the crime; there were no masked men and he stabbed monsieur beroldy himself. madame beroldy managed a tearfully-convincing performance in the witness box, convincing the jury of her innocence, but leaving most people suspicious. she then disappeared herself. poirot deduces that paul renauld was in fact georges conneau. he fled to canada and then south america where he made his fortune and gained a wife and a son. when they returned to france, by great misfortune, the immediate neighbour of the house he bought was madame beroldy, now madame daubreuil, who started to blackmail him. when a tramp died on his grounds of an epileptic fit, renauld saw a chance to duplicate the ruse of twenty years earlier by faking his own death and escaping his blackmailer with his wife's cooperation. his plan was to send his son away on business, give his chauffeur a holiday, and stage a kidnapping by tying his wife up and disappearing. after leaving the house he would go to the golf course and dig a grave where he knew it would be discovered; he would then put the tramp into the grave after destroying his features with the lead pipe. the plan was for this to happen at midnight, giving renauld the chance to get away from the local station on the last train and use the smashed watch to create an alibi. unfortunately, the smashing of the watch did not stop it, so the deception failed on poirot at least. what then went wrong was that renauld was stabbed by someone else after he finished digging the grave but before he could fetch the body of the tramp, hence his wife's faint when she saw that the body actually was her husband's. jack is proven innocent by another girl he was also in love with and as far as poirot is concerned that leaves only one suspect who had anything to gain by renauld dying: marthe daubreuil, who did not know of the change of will disinheriting jack and thought that by killing his father she would gain his fortune when she married his son. she overheard the renaulds discussing using the dead tramp as a ruse and stabbed renauld on the golf course after he had dug the grave. poirot arranges for madame renauld to openly disinherit jack in an attempt to force marthe out.the attempt succeeds and marthe dies when she tries to kill madame renauld. her mother disappears again. jack and his mother go to south america and hastings ends up with dulcie duveen, the sister of the girl who was able to prove jack's innocence. she is also the woman he met on the train at the beginning of the novel. ||| 6 ||| 6
bobby jones, the son of the vicar of the welsh seaside town of marchbolt, is playing a game of golf with a friend. he chips the ball over a cliff edge and when he goes to look for the ball he sees a man lying unconscious below. bobby's companion goes for help while bobby stays with the badly injured man. the man soon dies, but not before briefly regaining consciousness and saying “why didn’t they ask evans?” this, and a photograph of a beautiful woman bobby finds in the man's coat pocket, are the only clues to his identity. while bobby is waiting with the body another man finds him there. he introduces himself as roger bassington-ffrench and offers to stay with the body so bobby will not be late to play the organ at his father's church. the dead man is identified as alex pritchard by his sister, amelia cayman. she is said to be the woman in the photograph, and bobby wonders how such a beautiful girl could become such a coarse older woman. after the inquest, mrs. cayman and her husband want to know if pritchard had any last words. bobby says that he did not. later, when talking with his friend "frankie" – lady frances derwent – bobby remembers that pritchard did have last words and writes to the caymans to tell them. he receives a polite but dismissive reply in the post. bobby is due to start work with a friend at his garage in london, but receives an unexpected job offer from a firm in buenos aires. he rejects the offer. soon afterwards bobby falls ill after drinking from a bottle of beer. the beer had been poisoned. the local police can only conclude the poisoning was the work of a madman, but frankie thinks bobby was targeted for murder. bobby is convinced when he sees an old issue of the local paper that had printed the photograph used to find pritchard's sister. bobby immediately recognizes that the photo in the paper is not the one he found in the dead man's pocket. he and frankie realize that bassington-ffrench must have swapped the photograph while he was alone with the body and that mrs. cayman was likely not related to the dead man at all. bobby and frankie decide the best way to solve the mystery is to find bassington-ffrench. they manage to trace him to a house called merroway court in hampshire, owned by his brother henry and henry's wife sylvia. they stage a car accident outside the house with the help of a doctor friend so that frankie (really uninjured) will be invited to stay at merroway court to "recover". frankie produces a newspaper cutting about the mysterious dead man and sylvia remarks that he looks like a man she'd met named alan carstairs. he was a traveler and big-game hunter who was a friend of john savage, a millionaire who had killed himself a short time ago after finding out he had terminal cancer. frankie is also introduced to two neighbours of the bassington-ffrench’s – dr nicholson and his younger wife, moira. dr nicholson runs a local sanatorium and frankie writes to bobby and gets him to investigate the establishment. he breaks into the grounds at night and comes across a young girl who says that she is in fear of her life – it is the same girl in the original photograph that bobby found in the dead man’s pocket. bobby has to leave the grounds before they are discovered. several days later, the girl turns up at the local inn where bobby is staying. she identifies herself to him as moira nicholson. she is convinced that her husband is trying to kill her and she admits to knowing alan carstairs before her marriage to the doctor. bobby introduces her to frankie and it is moira who suggests that they simply ask roger if it was he who took the photograph on the body of the dead man. at the next opportunity, frankie does so and roger admits that did indeed take the picture, recognising moira and wanting to avoid scandal for a family friend at the inquest, but he did not put in the photograph of mrs. cayman. interested in the will of the late john savage, frankie consults her own family solicitor in london and finds out that by coincidence carstairs consulted him too. savage was staying with a mr. and mrs. templeton when he became convinced he had cancer, although one specialist told him it wasn’t the case and he was perfectly well. when he died by suicide, his will left seven hundred thousand pounds to the templetons who have now gone abroad. carstairs was also on their trail, suspicious of the will. bobby is kidnapped and frankie is lured to his place of confinement – an isolated cottage and finds herself held as well. their kidnapper is roger but they manage to turn the tables on him and find moira in the house but drugged. by the time the police arrive, roger has escaped. bobby and frankie trace the witnesses to the signing of john savage’s will. they are the former cook and gardener of mr. and mrs. templeton, mr. templeton being, in reality, mr. cayman. they are told that gladys, the parlour maid, wasn’t asked to witness the will – made the night before savage died - and realise that it must have been because she had previously served savage during his stay (the cook and gardener hadn’t) and she would have realised that it was roger who was taking his place in the "death-bed" after he forged the will's contents. they also discover that gladys’ name was evans, hence the reason for carstairs’ question – "why didn't they ask evans?" tracing the parlour maid they are amazed to find that she is now the housekeeper at the vicarage of bobby’s father. this is the reason for carstairs visit to wales – his attempt to find evans when he grew suspicious of savage's will and it is also the reason for the first attempt on bobby’s life – the villains couldn’t risk bobby (who found carstairs’ body) being in the same house as evans. going back to wales they find moira who claims she is being followed by roger and has come to them for help. frankie though is not taken in and spoils moira’s attempt to poison their coffee in the quiet country café they are in. moira was mrs. templeton and roger’s co-conspirator. attempting to shoot frankie and bobby in the café when she is exposed, she is successfully overpowered. several weeks later, frankie receives a letter from roger, posted from south america, in which he confesses his part and moira's part. bobby and frankie realise they are in love with each other and become engaged. ||| 3 ||| 6

the story revolves around a mixture of real and fictional characters, all connected in some way to the extended family of victor "pug" henry, a middle-aged naval officer and confidant of president franklin delano roosevelt. the story begins six months before germany's invasion of poland, which launched the european portion of the war, and ends shortly after the attack on pearl harbor, when the united states and, by extension, the henry family, enters the war as well. mixed into the text are "excerpts" from a book written by one of the book's fictional characters, german general armin von roon, written while he was in prison for war crimes. coming across the german version, a retired victor henry "translates" the volume in 1965. the text provides the reader with a german outlook at the war, with henry occasionally inserting notes as counterpoint to some of von roon's statements. as the story begins, navy commander victor "pug" henry has been appointed naval attache in berlin. during the voyage to europe on the s.s. bremen, victor befriends a british radio personality, alistair "talky" tudsbury, his daughter, pamela, and a german submarine officer, commodore grobke. in the movie version, he also meets german general armin von roon. von roon later becomes the viewpoint character for the german side of the war and witnesses the worsening of the german government's discrimination against the jews. through his work as the attache, pug recognizes the intent of the germans to invade poland. realizing that this would mean war with the soviet union, he concludes the only way for germany to safely invade is to agree not to go to war with the soviets, even though the communists and fascists are sworn, mortal enemies. going over his supervisor's head, he submits a report predicting the nazi-soviet nonaggression pact before it takes place. when the pact is made public, the report draws president roosevelt's attention to him, and the president asks pug to be his unofficial eyes and ears in europe. this assignment delays again his desired sea command, but later will give him the opportunity to travel to london, rome, and moscow and meet winston churchill, benito mussolini, and joseph stalin in addition to adolf hitler, whom he met in berlin. due to pug's increasing amount of travel and his aversion to many of the cultural events enjoyed by his wife, rhoda, she spends increasing amounts of time alone. through pug, she meets a widowed government engineer named palmer kirby, who later will be involved in the first phase of the manhattan project. rhoda and palmer begin to spend time together attending the opera and other events, but soon this leads to a romantic relationship. for his part, pug begins a platonic but very close and borderline romantic relationship with pamela, but can't decide to leave his wife rhoda for her. after having finally obtained command of a battleship, the uss california, he leaves for pearl harbor from moscow, where he has discussed lend-lease issues and observed a battle. he flies over asia and spends time in manila listening to the radio broadcast of the annual army-navy football game. when his flight is approaching pearl harbor, they receive message that an attack is under way. arriving at the base, they see the burning ships, including his own. pug's three children each have their own story lines. his older son, warren, is a united states naval academy graduate who enters navy flight school in florida. his daughter, madeline, begins a job in american radio. the child most prominent in the story is middle child and younger son byron, named after lord byron, the english poet. though a columbia university graduate and holding a naval reserve commission, byron has not committed himself to a career. in 1939 he accepts a job as a research assistant for an expatriate jewish author, aaron jastrow, who is best known for his book a jew's jesus and lives in siena, italy. byron also meets jastrow's niece, natalie, and her soon-to-be fiance, leslie slote, who works for the department of state. readers later discover that natalie and slote are also close friends of pamela tudsbury from their time in paris together. byron is three years younger than natalie, but catches her attention by heroically saving her uncle from being trampled by a stampeding horse during a festival in siena. byron and natalie visit her family's native town in poland, medzice, for a wedding, which occurs the night prior to the german invasion of poland. they are awakened early the next morning to evacuate as the town citizens flee from the invaders. they travel from medzice to warsaw ahead of the invading german army, and at one point the refugees are strafed by the luftwaffe and many are killed and injured. as they approach warsaw, they encounter polish soldiers who attempt to confiscate their automobile and leave them stranded. finally, they are in warsaw as the germans begin the siege and are evacuated along with other americans and citizens of neutral countries. during the encounters with the german and polish soldiers, byron repeatedly behaves heroically. leslie behaves in cowardly fashion under artillery fire, but stands up to the germans when they attempt to separate jewish americans. when natalie receives the proposal of marriage from leslie that she has been eagerly awaiting, she realizes that the experience in poland has changed her heart and that she is now in love with byron. after much beating around the bush, she admits this to byron, who promptly offers his own proposal of marriage, which natalie accepts. she returns to america upon receiving word that her father is quite ill and is able to also attend warren's wedding. her father dies of a heart attack upon hearing of the invasion of norway and denmark on april 9, 1940. in january 1941, she marries byron and devotes herself to getting her reluctant uncle out of europe to escape the nazis, soon discovering she is pregnant. all of the story lines are left as a cliffhanger as the united states is drawn into the war by the attack on pearl harbor. rhoda makes and then retracts a request for a divorce. with the uss california damaged and out-of-action, pug is given command of a cruiser, the uss northampton. byron has been trained as a submarine officer. warren has graduated from pensacola, married a congressman's daughter, janice lacouture, and is assigned to the uss enterprise. aaron, natalie, and natalie's infant son louis are trapped in europe as the war begins. these storylines continue through war and remembrance. ||| 0 ||| 5
the novel begins detailing the travels of the main characters as they move through the old world in order to accomplish temporary goals. their travels are interrupted by the entrances of nicholas, who is a slide (a wizard that is capable of soul stealing and using souls to project himself into animals). this situation is further complicated by owen, a man from the bandakar empire. he poisons richard in order to force him to help the bandakar empire shed the yoke of the imperial order. much of the novel focuses on richard's interactions with the bandakar people. the people of bandakar are all pristinely ungifted like richard's half-sister jennsen. they are descendants of the house of rahl who were banished into the old world thousands of years before. these people were then again banished by the people of the old world. a wizard,kaja-rang, placed them behind a boundary that would force any that tried to leave to walk straight to the pillars of creation. the bandakar shunned all forms of violence and they laid their lives down before any aggressor. it was believed that,because they "could not see evil" or, rather because they strongly embraced a philosophy which required them to disbelieve reality that they were a threat to the existence of the old world. richard convinces several of the bandakar to shed their ideals and embrace the individualist ideas espoused by richard and his d'haran empire. this allowed the bandakar to take up arms and fight for their own freedom. however, throughout the entire ordeal richard is reeling not only from the poison the bandakar gave him, but also because his gift is out of balance. nathan and ann go to the bandakar empire in order to realign richard with prophecy. they save richard and his companions from certain death, but are ultimately unable to aid him in restoring his gift to balance. eventually richard realizes that his belief that not eating meat would be the necessary balance to his need to kill was mistaken. by not putting his faith in himself and in his abilities he was creating improper balancing ultimately causing not only the gift within himself to twist and fail, but also the magic of the sword of truth to fail. he realizes that his actions are justified in themselves and require no additional balancing. after richard has once again set himself in order, he and the bandakar people destroy the remaining imperial order encampment in bandakar resulting in the death of nicholas, who destroys the antidote, and the rescue of kahlan. richard uses his gift to piece together the what and how of creating the antidote himself. during the course of these actions, zedd and adie are captured as the keep is taken by men captured from bandakar and forced to do the work of the imperial order. they were forced to identify random objects from within the keep for a sister of the dark. if they refused to do so, they were forced to listen to the screams of children being tortured while their parents begged them to give up the information. as a result of this identification process, zedd is able to unleash a constructed spell within an object that kills several men in the camp along with all the other artifacts. zedd and adie are saved from destruction by three independently orchestrated rescue attempts: captain zimmer and some of his men, chase and rachel, and rikka. adie goes with zimmer and his men to free the families being used for torture, while zedd and chase go back to reclaim the keep. while in the keep, zedd remembers a time when it was full of the laughter of children and families; as a result, he invites chase to move in with his family to guard the keep. ||| 2 ||| 2

the plot partially revolves around the missing master copy of a film cartridge, titled infinite jest and referred to in the novel as "the entertainment" or "the samizdat". the film is so entertaining to its viewers that they become lifeless, losing all interest in anything other than viewing the film. the video cartridge was the final work of film by james o. incandenza before his microwave suicide, completed during a stint of sobriety that was requested by the lead actress, joelle. quebec separatists are interested in acquiring a master, redistributable copy of the work to aid in acts of terrorism against the united states. the united states office of unspecified services (usous) is seeking to intercept the master copy of the film in order to prevent mass dissemination and the destabilization of the organization of north american nations. joelle and later hal seek treatment for substance abuse problems at the ennet house drug and alcohol recovery house, and marathe visits the rehabilitation center to pursue a lead on the master copy of the entertainment, tying the characters and plots together. ||| 5 ||| 5
pippinella is special in that she possesses what is generally assumed to be an exclusive trait of male canaries: birdsong. ultimately, doctor dolittle creates a "canary opera" (using canaries and other bird species as well), based on pippinella's life story. this opera, jointly composed by both the doctor and pippinella, becomes an overwhelming success in london. the novel disrupts the chronological order of the series, with events occurring between doctor dolittle's circus and the voyages of doctor dolittle despite the book's publication between doctor dolittle's zoo and doctor dolittle's garden. this book is the follow-up to doctor dolittle's circus, for the doctor (at this point in time) is still operating the circus he inherited from the runaway former owner, albert blossom. pippinella's eventual fate, and doctor dolittle's final adventures with her, are ultimately revealed in the much later book, doctor dolittle and the green canary. ||| 0 ||| 2

set in the middle of the twenty-first century, the simulacra is the story of several protagonists within the united states of europe and america (usea), formed by the merger of (west) germany and the united states, where the whole government is a fraud and the president (der alte, "the old man") is a simulacrum (android). as well as the usea, other global superpowers are the french empire, people's republic of china and free (black) africa. there is some mention of a world war three, which may have involved some tactical nuclear weapons, and a possibility that the soviet union exists. communism still exists, but poland has become its global centre of authority, with its administrative centre now based in warsaw. society is stratified into 'ges' (german geheimnisträger, "bearers of the secret" (the elite)) and 'bes' (german befehlsträger, "implementers of instruction" (professional and artisanal)) classes, and there is conspicuous consolidation of political and broadcast media power. the democratic and republican parties merged into a single party, the 'democrat-republican party' and the 'united triadic network' presumably resulted from an amalgamation of nbc, cbs and abc. in addition, actual political power has devolved to a permanent first lady, nicole thibodeaux, whose consorts are a series of male presidents – die alten. while the current der alte, rudi kalbfleisch, is a simulacrum, "nicole" is human, although the original nicole thibodeaux died several decades ago. since the death of the original, her role has been portrayed by four consecutive actors, and the latest such figure is kate rupert. this is a geheimnis (secret), and insider possession of this secret is enough to insure elite membership through conferral of ges status. a secretive governing council controls the usea, although 'karp und söhne werke', as manufacturers of the current der alte-simulacrum, exerts some power. the next simulacrum contract, for dieter hogbein, however, will be given to 'frauenzimmer associates', and karp und söhne is unhappy about this new contractual arrangement. one subplot involves the karp und söhne werke threatened exposure of what has been a state secret over the last five decades. nicole dislikes kalbfleisch, although inbuilt obsolescence means that he is about to suffer an obligatory heart attack and he will be replaced in his turn. kalbfleisch only momentarily appears in this novel. doctor egon superb encounters additional difficulties because a. g. chemie, the leading usea psycho-pharmaceutical drug cartel, has engineered the prohibition of psychotherapy under the "macphearson act." however, the usea is willing to let him continue to practice, and treat richard kongrosian, a well known pianist who performs in the white house. richard kongrosian believes that his body odor is lethal; this belief is delusional, he has no such body odor. kongrosian has telekinetic abilities: he can play piano using only his mind. nicole thibodeaux is anxious to keep his abilities under control, as are wilder pembroke, head of the national police, and members of the covert national governance council. bertold goltz (an alleged neofascist) is seemingly trying to overthrow the government, and runs the 'sons of job', a religious paramilitary organisation, although he is not what he seems, and is secretly head of the covert usea governing council. in addition, there is a subplot that involves charles (chic) strikerock, vince, his brother and a cut-price colonisation spacecraft sales firm (known as "loony lukes") involved in martian colonisation. mars boasts insectoid life, the sentient and empathic 'papoola', while ganymede is inhabited by multicellular primitive life forms. nothing is as it seems, and the novel ends inconclusively. the der alte-simulacrum has been revealed as an android and kate/nicole has been disclosed as an impostor- therefore undoing the geheimnis (secret) raison d'etre for ges/bes class stratification. bertold goltz is killed by a national police detachment, as is the rest of the covert governing council. using telekinesis, kongrosian kills pembroke before he can overthrow nicole in a coup d'etat and teleports her to safety at his secluded northern us home. karp und sohnen rebel against the abortive coup, however, and soon the national police and usea armed forces are engaged in civil war, with active use of low-yield nuclear weapons. recrudescent neanderthals (or "chuppers") seem happy at this turn of events, as they gather near kongrosian's home: the imminent self-destruction of homo sapiens might give them another opportunity to dominate earth. ||| 5 ||| 5
some time in the future (as evidenced by technology in use that is much more advanced than in the first story), norton&mdash;a man of about forty&mdash;is living a life of nomadic wandering when a ghost named gawain asks him to father a child to his widow, orlene, with whom norton eventually falls in love. gawain then asks gaea, the incarnation of nature, to make the child in his own likeness so his bloodline would continue. unfortunately, the child ends up dead due to a disease that runs in gawain's family. orlene then commits suicide. feeling depressed about the disastrous results of his affair with orlene, norton is approached by gawain again, who offers norton the position of time (chronos), where he must rule over all earthly aspects of time. gawain explains to norton that chronos lives backwards in time until the moment of the birth—or conception, it is never made clear—of the office holder's previous self, who is still living forwards. the ghost baits norton, explaining to him that, by living backwards, he can continue to see orlene, since she is still alive in the past. norton accepts, and gawain leads him to the spot where the future office holder of time, norton's predecessor, will pass the hourglass onto norton. norton immediately starts literally living life backwards in time, though he can temporarily go forward in order to interact with others. however, when he is living backwards, he is not visible to mortals. norton experiments with his hourglass, recognized by all the incarnations as being the most powerful magical device in the world, to halt and/or reverse time, travel many millions of years into the earth's past, and work with the incarnation of fate, who needs his hourglass to help fix tangles in her threads of fate. because norton lives backwards in time, his past is everyone else's future, making him an isolated character even among the other incarnations. he also realises that this will make it impossible to have a relationship with the forward-living orlene. he does, however, have an affair with clotho, the youngest aspect of fate. this is both awkward and intriguing to norton since her past is his future. residing at his new residence in purgatory, norton is then visited by satan, who informs norton that while he can travel anywhere in time with his hourglass, he cannot leave earth. satan claims to have the power to travel the whole universe, since evil permeates all of reality, and gives norton some samples of this ability by having him travel to other planets where, satan claims, time flows backwards, allowing norton to live normally and to get involved in both a space opera ("bat durston and the bems") and an epic fantasy adventure. satan offers norton the ability to have that power if norton will grant satan a favor; to go back in time 20 years and save a man from committing suicide. norton goes back in time to check out this young man, but after consulting with the other incarnations, he is informed that this man is the current office holder of the incarnation of death (thanatos—in other words, zane, from the previous novel) and that it is zane's attempted suicide that brought him to that position. this man is needed as thanatos in order to protect his girlfriend, luna kaftan, from satan's mischief so she can go into politics and fulfill a prophecy of thwarting satan. however, a relic satan had given norton turned out to be a demon in disguise. when norton went back in time, the demon disembarked a few years in the past to prevent luna from going into politics (the demon gives an incumbent politician an antidote to keep him alive so luna doesn't take his place). due to some of the limitations of the hourglass, intercepting this demon is difficult, but norton eventually manages to stop it. not giving up, satan tries one more time by trapping norton on one of the other planets he had an adventure on. not sure how to get back home, norton starts toying with the hourglass, traveling all the way back to the beginning of the observable universe and all the way to its end (from the big bang to the point where all matter became trapped in black holes) and realizes that, since the incarnations' magic does not extend beyond earth, his adventures on other planets were illusions created by satan, and that norton had, in fact, never left earth. norton then finds out that the demon that created the illusion had been attached to him and, once again, disembarked at a point in the past, two years after the events of the first book, to begin a campaign to discredit luna so she doesn't run for office. norton then goes back in time to this point and uses his hourglass to show the world all the bad things that will happen if luna doesn't get elected. as norton is no longer fooled by satan's illusions, satan stops trying to exploit him. ||| 2 ||| 5
after her rescue by the rebels of district 13, katniss is convinced to become "the mockingjay": a symbol of the rebellion against the ruling capitol. as part of the agreement, she demands that the leader of district 13, president coin, grant immunity to all of the quarter quell participants , including peeta, and that katniss reserves the right to kill president snow, the unquestioned leader of panem. much to her displeasure, katniss is kept away from the battles and works to create propaganda for the rebels. katniss is unable to cope with the guilt as she watches a mentally ill peeta on television, where he is forced to provide propaganda against her and the rebels for the capitol. finally, district 13 leaders decide to rescue peeta, realizing that katniss's guilt is impeding her role as "the mockingjay." after the rescue, it is discovered that peeta has been brainwashed into believing katniss is the enemy, and he attempts to strangle her during their reunion. peeta's brainwashing deeply effects and disturbs katniss, but he gradually improves after much treatment and therapy, including cake decorating. his childhood friend, delly cartwright, helps with his recovery by recounting happy events from their past. soon, peeta recovers fully enough to train. katniss and her propaganda unit are sent off on a mission to the capitol, and president coin later sends peeta with them in replacement of another soldier, although his many scarred memories fuel his rage. the rebels, including katniss, gain control of the districts and begin an assault on the capitol. a propaganda filming in a "safe" capitol neighborhood goes wrong, and katniss and her team flee further into the city with the intent of finding and killing president snow. many members of katniss's team are killed through intense urban warfare, including hunger games victor finnick odair. eventually, katniss presses on alone towards snow's mansion, which has supposedly been opened to shelter capitol children, but is actually intended to trap the kids and use them as human shields for president snow. as she reaches the mansion, a hover plane with capitol markings drops supply parachutes to the children which then explode, killing many of children. a rebel medical team, including katniss's sister prim, attempt to provide care to the wounded children as the rest of the parachutes explode killing prim and many others. after watching her younger sister die, katniss is even more determined to get her revenge on president snow. after the rebels' victory, it is decided to punish the gamemakers, by holding a hunger games with children from the capitol. while recovering from the same explosion that killed her sister, katniss accidentally encounters president snow who is under house arrest. snow tells that her that he did not order the assault that killed prim, saying he would have escaped if he had access to a hover plane. when katniss expresses her doubts about his innocence, snow reminds her that they had agreed not to lie to each other following the 74th annual hunger games. katniss recalls that the bombing resembles a trap originally developed by gale hawthorne; gale denies his involvement but katniss cannot help holding him responsible. at snow's execution, katniss thinks back to her conversation with him, and realizes someone high up would have to give permission for prim to be on the front lines despite her young age. making it look like the capitol killed prim would push katniss's loyalty to coin and would also drive a wedge between the capitol and president snow. when she is given the opportunity to assassinate snow, katniss raises her bow and shoots coin instead, killing her. a riot ensues and snow is found dead. katniss then tries to commit suicide, but peeta stops her. katniss is acquitted due to her apparent insanity and sent home to district 12, along with others who are attempting to rebuild. peeta returns months later, having largely recovered from his brainwashing. katniss falls back in love with peeta, recognizing she needs his hope, and strength, in contrast to gale who has the same fire she already finds in herself. together with haymitch they write a book filled with the stories of previous tributes of the hunger games and those who died in the war to preserve their memory. in the epilogue, twenty years later katniss and peeta are married and have two children. the hunger games are over, but katniss dreads the day her children learn about their parents' involvement in both the games and the war. when she feels distressed, katniss plays a comforting but repetitive "game," reminding herself of every good thing that she has ever seen someone do. the series ends with katniss claiming that "there are much worse games to play." ||| 7 ||| 5
max jones works the family farm in the ozark mountains. with his father dead and his stepmother remarrying a man he detests, max runs away from home, taking his uncle's astrogation manuals. most occupations are tightly controlled by guilds, most with hereditary memberships. one such is the astrogators guild. since his uncle had been a member and had no children, max hopes that before he died, his uncle had named him his heir. he begins hitchhiking towards earthport to find out. along the way, he finds a friendly face in hobo sam anderson, who later alludes to being a deserter from the imperial marines. sam feeds max and offers advice, though he later departs with max's valuable manuals. at the guild's headquarters, max is disappointed to find that he had not been named as an heir, but he is returned his uncle's substantial security deposit for his manuals. max learns that sam had tried to claim the deposit for himself. by chance, he runs into an apologetic sam. with max's money, sam is able to finagle them a one way job/trip aboard a starship using forged papers. max signs on as a steward's mate third class, and then he absorbs the contents of the stewards' guild manual using his eidetic memory. among his duties is caring for several animals, including passengers' pets—work with which he is comfortable. when passenger eldreth "ellie" coburn visits her pet, an alien, semi-intelligent "spider puppy" that max has befriended, she learns that he can play three-dimensional chess, and she challenges him to a game. a champion player, she diplomatically lets him win. meanwhile, sam manages to rise to the position of master-at-arms. when, through ellie's machinations, the ship's officers discover that max had learned astrogation from his uncle, max is promoted to the command deck. under the tutelage of chief astrogator hendrix and chief computerman kelly, he becomes a probationary apprentice chartsman, then a probationary astrogator. in a meeting with hendrix, max reluctantly admits to faking his record to get into space. hendrix defers the matter until their return to earth. the asgard then departs for halcyon, a human colony planet orbiting nu pegasi. when hendrix dies, the astrogation department is left dangerously shorthanded. the aging captain tries to take his place, but is not up to the task. when max detects an error in his real-time calculations leading up to a "transition", neither the captain nor assistant astrogator simes believe him, and the ship winds up lost. they locate a habitable world, and the passengers become colonists. meanwhile, the crew continues to try to figure out where they are, and if they can get back to the earth. unfortunately, it turns out the planet is already inhabited by intelligent centaurs. max and ellie are captured, but ellie's pet is able to guide sam and a rescue party to them. they escape, though sam is killed covering their retreat. upon his return, max is informed that the captain has died. simes tried to illegally take command and was killed by sam, leaving max as the only remaining astrogator. to make matters worse, simes hid or destroyed the astrogation manuals. vastly outnumbered by the hostile natives, the humans are forced to attempt a perilous return to known space by reversing the erroneous transition. max must not only pilot the ship, he must supply the missing astrogation tables from his eidetic memory. to add to his burdens, the remaining officers inform max that he must take charge, as only an astrogator can be the captain. the pressure is immense, but max succeeds and the ship returns to known space. max pays heavy fines for breaking guild regulations, but he becomes a member of the astrogators guild. however, he loses any chance for a relationship with eldreth: she returns home to marry her boyfriend. max accepts this with mixed feelings, but looks forward to his new career. ||| 5 ||| 5
the novel zorachus is chock full of sex and violence. it depicts several gory scenes of death, murder, war, and torture. it depicts in equally explicit fashion many scenes of sex. very little of the sex is of the standard variety. the novel features as its protagonist the eponymous mancdaman zorachus, a powerful sorcerer who at the beginning of the novel was in his early 30s and had become a seventh level adept of the sharajnaghi order. he was acknowledged by teachers and peers alike to be the most puissant sorcerer in the world. after his elevation to seventh level adept, zorachus learned from his teachers that he was the son of mancdaman zancharthus, former ruler of the city of khymir, in the north. khymir was, and always has been, the most evil city in the world, a bottomless pit of vice and temptation. emissaries had come from khymir to ask zorachus to come back to his father's city and help the current regime rule the place. zorachus was asked by his sharajnaghi teachers to go to khymir and, under the guise of doing the will of the ruling order and enjoying the pleasures of khymir, prevent khymir's evil from spilling out and making victims of nearby peoples. zorachus was a very moral man, having been raised by the sharajnaghi. he was afraid that he would not be able to resist the temptations to lust and violence khymir and its people, and tchernobog, offered. however, he was eventually convinced by his friends and teachers to go. from the very start, even on the voyage by water to khymir, the khymirians tempted zorachus, performing sexually in front of him and inviting him to join in. zorachus resisted these blatantly sexual advances fairly easily. he had a more difficult time not killing his khymirian hosts to wipe out their evil. for instance, when the khymirian ship was attacked by kragehul pirates, zorachus helped fight the pirates using his natural fighting ability and his battle magic. the victorious khymirian sailors and soldiers, however, began to rape the captured kragehul. zorachus nearly gave into the urge to blast the rapists with the same magic he had used to blast the pirates. the magnitude and variety of the temptations only increased after zorachus arrived in khymir. slavery was widespread in khymir, and no one saw anything wrong in mistreating, torturing, raping, or killing slave and freeman alike, so long as the victim was of lower class than the victimizer. zorachus was very strong-willed, but even he began to despair under the constant onslaught of horrible experiences he was forced to witness, all the while pretending he saw nothing wrong. in the end, zorachus' bloodlust; his repressed desire for the asa, wife of his kragehul friend halfdan; his loathing for asa's lesbian, unfaithful relationship with the female slave leahkalah; and his self-hatred; all combined to convince him that every human was evil. zorachus led a coup d'etat, using baleful, evil, forbidden magic to seize absolute power in khymir. he personally killed dozens of people in horrifying ways, completely abandoning all his former moral precepts. this was just as tchernobog had planned, turning a good and moral magician-warrior to evil. ||| 2 ||| 2

sentence for being caught while disposing of suicide victim kilburn jerry after a party; young clarkie, whom the narrator expects will be taking his place when he retires; and terry, friend to all.

late to make the purchase. in the next scene, narrator is invited to mortimer's pornshop, loveland, and interrupts an argument between mort and an employee, nobby, who is confused on what to do over a shipment from the netherlands of low-quality sex gear that they did not order. it is decided to send it back. mort then drives the narrator to a fancy, out-of-the-way restaurant called pepi's barn,

he leaves upon promising to find a buyer for the pills, albeit at a much lower price than if the yahoos would consent to releasing the pills in small installments. the narrator tells the yahoos that the pills are worth much less than they believe, which they are not happy to hear. the narrator tasks his old friend cody, aka billy bogus and his partner tiptoes with locating charlie. cody expects little difficulty and quickly accepts the job. while looking for cody in a london club, the narrator encounters sydney, a low-ranking member of the yahoos, the crew holding the two million pills. the narrator then meets sydney's girlfriend tammy, who he is immediately attracted to. before leaving the club, tammy gives him her number and surreptitiously asks him to call her. while speaking with sydney, the narrator hears a story about the leader of sydney's crew, a man named darren who prefers to be known as the duke. the duke and his girlfriend, slasher, are a pair of dedicated coke addicts who live just outside of london. the pair of them have become steadily more paranoid due to their cocaine use, and this paranoia leads slasher to attack a member of the local council with pepper spray when he visits their home. slasher also manages to kill one of the duke's prized dobermans, mike tyson, by shooting it. sydney thinks the story is hilarious, but the narrator panics upon realizing that the duke probably had his number along with mr. mortimer's, and the police could very well have information on them now. the narrator sets about finding a buyer for the ecstasy pills, and he, mortimer and clarkie go to liverpool to meet with trevor and shanks, two powerful north england drug dealers. upon their arrival, shanks tells the narrator and his colleagues that the "yahoos" have in fact stolen the pills from a neo-nazi outfit in amsterdam, and they used the narrator and mortimers' names to gain credibility. shanks tells the narrator that the germans have unleashed an assassin named klaus to recover the pills and eliminate the thieves. unfortunately for the narrator, klaus believes that he was the one who initiated the robbery. the meeting ends and trevor invites the narrator to come to dinner at his house. the narrator has a nightmare involving jimmy price and awakes to a television news story about the brutal torture and murder of a boatman named van tuck. at trevor's house, trevor and the narrator are discussing the state of the drugs game when the narrator offhandedly mentions van tuck's murder. trevor flies into a panic and takes the narrator to see duncan, a local reporter who is friendly with many police officers and feeds trevor information. on the way, trevor explains that van tuck was a smuggler and he was currently moving several million pounds worth of marijuana into the country for trevor. trevor's hope is that van tuck had not yet picked up the shipment, but there is a strong possibility that the police will have confiscated the drugs during their investigation of van tuck's murder. through duncan, trevor discovers that the cannabis has been seized by the police and after destroying many of duncan's possessions in a rage, the action moves back to london. the narrator and morty receive a call from cody, telling them that he has located kinky, charlie's boyfriend, in a flat in king's cross. upon arriving at the flat, the men find that kinky is dead of a heroin overdose, and one of the crackheads who was living with kinky believes that kinky was murdered. the narrator is intrigued to learn that kinky had turned up at the flat shortly before his death with charlie and two grand in cash. the crackheads tell them that charlie has gone to brighton and the narrator sends cody after her. the narrator and morty retire to a cafe, where they run into freddy hurst, a fat and slovenly ex-gangster who is down on his luck. freddy subtly ridicules morty and asks for some money. morty complies, but when freddy makes another comment, morty flies into a rage and beats freddy almost to death in the middle of the crowded cafe. morty and the narrator flee, with the narrator deeply troubled by what he has just witnessed. that night, the narrator visits gene at his flat. gene goes over the beating in great detail and informs the narrator that if freddy dies, the narrator is left with two options. he can either testify against morty or he will go to prison as an accomplice to murder. gene then goes on to explain that freddy hurst was an influential gangster in the late 1970s in london, and that gene and morty were members of his crew. after kilburn jerry killed himself and morty was caught disposing of the body, freddy was about to go away for about 12 years to serve concurrent sentences. freddy could have gotten morty off the hook but chose not to, leading to morty doing 5 years in prison unnecessarily. the narrator gets very drunk with gene, and the next day decides to arrange a meeting with tammy at the churchill hotel. while showering at the hotel before tammy arrives, the narrator is kidnapped by two unidentified men and transported across london to the city. there he meets eddie temple, who explains that jimmy has double-crossed the narrator. jimmy had become involved in a scheme with some gangsters from chechnya to purchase a consignment of non-existent pakistani heroin. jimmy had been taken in by the gangsters and had lost nearly 13 million pounds. in his rage, jimmy believed that his old friend eddie had arranged for jimmy to be ensnared, and he therefore tasked the narrator to find charlie, eddie's daughter. jimmy believed that if he could hold charlie hostage, he could force eddie to get his money back. eddie goes on to explain that jimmy has been moonlighting as a police informer for a number of years. eddie plays the narrator a recording in which jimmy speaks with albie carter, a member of the southeast regional crime squad. jimmy tells albie that he wants the narrator to be arrested for possession of drugs, which would result in a 12 year sentence. jimmy had sent the narrator to a dodgy accountant, and after the narrator is imprisoned, jimmy was planning to take control of his assets to recover his lost wealth. eddie drops the narrator off back at the churchill with the recording. the narrator decides to take matters into his own hands and proceeds to jimmy's mansion in totteridge. there, he sneaks into the grounds of price's house and kills him with a gun he borrowed from gene. the narrator heads back into london, where his colleagues are frantically trying to find out who killed jimmy. the narrator is convinced that he got away cleanly and is unconcerned. he is summoned with morty to see gene, who promptly beats the narrator viciously and breaks his wrist. it transpires that gene has discovered that the narrator killed jimmy with the same gun that gene used to kill crazy larry flynn, a homosexual london gangster who had been friends with both gene and morty. upon producing the recording, the narrator manages to convince gene and morty that jimmy was an informer, and they trust one another again. the narrator now decides to eliminate both of his remaining problems. one, he has to stop klaus the murderous nazi and, two, he has find a way to steal the pills back from the yahoos. the narrator and morty contact shanks in liverpool and get him to send an assassin down on the train. the narrator lures klaus to primrose park and lies in wait with the sniper. the narrator spots a tall blonde man in the park and, believing this man to be klaus, orders to sniper to kill him, which he does. the narrator then realizes that they have killed the wrong man and see klaus run away from the scene. gene flies into a rage when he hears what has happened, and dispatches some of his own men to find and kill klaus, which they do. the narrator then contracts cody to organize a false police raid on the yahoos hideout to steal back the pills. cody and his team assault the hideout, posing as armed police. they allow the yahoos to escape and they "confiscate" the pills. gene and the narrator find the yahoos in a run-down bar and convince them that the police who raided them were crooked and have taken the pills for themselves. the narrator had previously worked out a deal with eddie ryder to give ryder the pills in return for 2.5 million pounds. thinking that his job is finally complete, the narrator and his colleagues take the pills to eddie temple's bonded warehouse at heathrow airport, where temple is having the pills flown to tokyo. when they arrive at the airport, eddie and his private security team take them all hostage and take the pills. temple takes the pills, telling the narrator that he is owed them as a result of the narrator causing charlie distress. temple then delivers a speech to the narrator, explaining the nature of the drugs game, crime and life in general: "you're born, you take shit. get out in the world, you take more shit. climb a little higher, you take less shit. until one day you're up in the rarified atmosphere and you've forgotten what shit even looks like. welcome to the layer cake, son." seemingly defeated, the narrator and his colleagues then discover that they have delivered the wrong boxes to temple. the boxes were actually filled with sex toys and pornography that morty had been able to sell at loveland, the sex shop that he owned. the real pills had been shipped back to amsterdam and to an unknown fate. clarkie then tells morty that had freddie hurst has died of his injuries, which could cause serious problems for morty. the story then fast-forwards about three years. the narrator is now living on the northern coast of venezuela where he runs a bar. it turns out that about six weeks after temple took the pills, the narrator and tammy were eating in a restaurant in london when sydney, tammy's jilted ex-boyfriend found them. sydney shot the narrator multiple times, including in the head. the narrator spent six weeks in a coma and awoke with a steel plate in his head. he is visited in hospital by a mysterious government official, who may work for the police or mi5. the man tells the narrator to abandon the drugs trade and leave britain or else he would find himself in prison for a very long time. the narrator moves to venezuela and leaves us with the line, "my name? if you knew that, you'd be as clever as me." ||| 1 ||| 6
the novel opens with a mysterious lady, who, having grown bored with contemplating the universe, has decided to bring it to an end. she walks to the beach of the island where she lives alone, and summons a storm. as the storm builds up, a bottle washes up to the shore. the lady picks up the bottle, takes out a manuscript it contains, and begins to read as the storm stands by and waits for her. q is deep-sea fishing (literally standing at the bottom of an ocean) with his wife q and son q, when the ocean begins draining into a giant whirlpool. q powerlessly watches as his wife and son are taken in, and is only barely able to escape. he arrives in the holodeck of the enterprise, where picard and data's fishing simulation had been disturbed by the same disaster. in order to investigate what happened, q takes picard and data to the q continuum, which they perceive as the fictional world of dixon hill. there, they learn that the universe is ending, and that not only is the q continuum powerless to stop it, the continuum actually welcomes the opportunity. having explored all there is to explore and experienced all there is to experience, the continuum is old and bored, and the end of the universe is seen as a welcomed liberation. q is unwilling to accept this decision, so the continuum freeze him as a statue. but with the help of q2, q escapes this punishment and the continuum. q, data and picard return to the site of the whirlpool, to find it has calmed down and turned into a long shaft leading underground, which they proceed to explore. the world down the shaft is actually five superposed worlds, each of which is a level of the kübler-ross model of the five stages of grief, populated by members of the multiverse with the appropriate reaction to the end of the universe. q, picard and data go through each level, trying to reach the bottom. while exploring, q contemplates his existence and that of the q continuum, the most powerful beings in existence, since he is convinced god does not exist. he reminisces on a young girl (melony) he met in times square during the 2000 new year party, in a parallel universe where he was posing as a human. she was insightful and intelligent, and when they kissed, q thought she could almost feel his true power. in that universe, the celebration in times square was the target of a terrorist attack. q, enraged by this senseless act, immediately puts out the fires and explosions, but not before melony is killed. he later finds her body amongst the dead. the first level is denial. this level is populated with beings who try to ignore the fact the universe is ending, focusing instead on their more normal daily problems. everyone is herded onto a train headed for oblivion, but no one believes it. q, picard, and data battle locutus in a race to uncouple the train before it incinerates every non-believing being on it. the second level is anger. here, q briefly encounters a parallel-universe version of jadzia dax who, following the events of blood oath, chose not to return to deep space nine but instead to continue fighting with kang, kor and koloth. together, the four of them are hunting the romulans also present on this level, believing the whole thing to be some kind of romulan ploy. however, q realizes that the real culprit is his rival from the enemy m continuum, who tries to blame him for the end of the universe. m stages a trial against q in front of an infuriated jury, but data wins the case by acting more angered than m and turning the jury against her. the third level is bargaining. this level is dominated, appropriately enough, by grand nagus zek, who offers to trade whatever the other residents of the level own for empty promises of an afterlife. q is finally reunited with his son q. however, q is now an adult, who has lived a long and depressed life believing his father had abandoned him to the whirlpool. after much trouble, q manages to convince q that he never stopped trying to find him. relieved, q reverts back to his normal age. the fourth level is despair. on this level, q finds his wife; however, she is so depressed that even seeing him is not enough for her to find something to live for, and she like the others on the level sinks into the mire. after she dies, engulfed in despair, q and the rest of the party enter a small house, which is the fifth and final level, acceptance. the house consists of a large room with an unopenable door at the far end. when all the members of the party sit down and give up on trying to save the universe, the back wall of the room begins to close in on them. they struggle to push it back, but finally as q accepts his fate the door flies open and he and q tumble through; picard and data are crushed. q finds himself and his son back in the q continuum, which is now seen as a new year's eve party, complete with a countdown to the end of the universe. it is the same as it was when he and picard first arrived at the beginning of the quest. q supposes that the whole quest was created to make him accept the inevitable. q2 neither denies nor confirms this, instead offering that the q continuum is very much in the dark about all this and that, possibly, they had nothing to do with his adventure. when the countdown reaches zero, the whirlpool starts anew, and the q continuum is pulled into it without a fight. q tries to hold on to his dad, but he's pulled in too. q however resists the pull, refusing to accept that it is the end. he creates a written record of his journey and puts it in a bottle, which he throws into the whirlpool. the story cuts back to the beach, where the lady finishes reading q's manuscript. she laughs out loud, and decides to call off the storm. she then finds q, wakes him, and gives him a mud boat to return home. but before he leaves, she writes something on a piece of paper, puts it in q's bottle and hands it to q, to give to his father. back in the holodeck, picard, data, q and his wife awaken in the simulated fishing boat. they spot q's mud boat, and picard orders the computer to "end program". everything disappears, except for the five individuals and q's boat. q tells his father of the island and the lady, whom q recognizes as the girl he met in times square. q then gives q the bottle containing the lady's message, but q is too scared to open it. he hands it to picard, who opens it and reads the message: "let there be light". ||| 5 ||| 5
as the book opens, agamemnon and his fleet is anchored within sight of the burning dardanos. then aeneas, known as helikaon, appears in his ship, the xanthos. he sets fire to the whole fleet. in troy, meanwhile, the situation is grim. priam is slowly losing his mind. his sons and generals attempt to plan the defence of the city. kassandra (cassandra) must travel to the isle of thera with andromache, wife of hektor. andromache and kassandra board the xanthos, which will go first to thera, and then to aeneas's colony far away in the seven hills (that is, rome) for necessary supplies of tin. aeneas's best friend gershom is troubled by prophecies about himself kassandra has told him. gershom is, in fact, the fugitive egyptian prince, ahmose (moses). on the journey, helikaon and andromache become lovers. helikaon does not know that she has already borne him a son, passed off as the son of hektor. when they reach thera and kassandra leaves them, gershom sees a ship from egypt and knows that he must leave helikaon and sail to egypt to face his destiny as moses. meanwhile, the trojan captains banokles and kalliades realise that troy is about to face an unexpected attack. they hurry back from dardanos, too late: paris and helen are dead and the city is in danger. odysseus, the reluctant ally of agamemnon, forms a plan which enables the attackers to capture the plain outside troy, and the lower part of the city itself. the xanthos arrives and delivers andromache and the tin, then escapes with the trojan fleet, burning and sinking fifty-seven enemy ships as they do so. hektor and the trojan horse leave the city to endure the siege. hektor kills patroklos, the friend of achilles. odysseus, once a friend of hektor, carries to him an offer from agamemnon and achilles: all the women and children except for the royal family will get to leave troy and the siege if hektor fights achilles. the fight is a trick: agamemnon wants both dead. his agent poisons hektor's blade, so achilles starts dying. a mob attacks hektor for his supposed treachery, but he fights them off with the aid of achilles. odysseus exposes the plot and agamemnon's agent too late: both heroes die. odysseus and his friend nestor refuse to remain under such a treacherous leader as agamemnon, and abandon the siege, along with the myrmidons. agamemnon decides that it is time to use one of odysseus's plans to gain access to the city. skorpios, one of hektor's trojan horse, wakes up, having been knocked unconscious. he discovers that many of his comrades are dead and that the rest have fled. their armour has all been stripped. finding a horse, skorpios rides off in the direction of troy. on the walls of troy, the defenders can see fifty of the trojan horse, chased by two hundred of agamemnon's soldiers. the trojan horse are headed for the gates. the trojans open the gates and let the trojan horse in. however, kalliades realises too late that it is a trap - they are not trojan horse, merely disguised as them. the fifty open the gates from the inside and breach the city. banokles and kalliades fall back to the palace, leading the last remnants of resistance as priam is killed. they know that andromache and the two boys in her care - her son to helikaon astyanax and helikaon's wife's son dex - must escape. helikaon arrives and starts climbing into troy by the north wall. andromache catches his rope and he climbs in. helikaon and kalliades help andromache carry the two boys out of the window and onto the ground, but before they can climb back in to their deaths banokles cuts the rope. banokles is soon the sole defender of troy, and falls at last. however, before agamemnon can celebrate the victory he is driven out of the city by the hittite emperor, who is angry at the fall of troy. troy's treasury was utterly spent, but agamemnon believes helikaon to have taken it to thera. skorpios joins helikaon's band, and they sail to thera on the xanthos. there they meet odysseus, and kalliades and skorpios join him. the two ships part. agamemnon lands on thera and interrogates kassandra. then thera's volcano erupts, killing them both and everybody else on the island. the xanthos survives a series of tsunamis, but the fate of odysseus's ship is unknown. banokles's sacrifice and the tale of the odyssey suggest that at least kalliades and odysseus survive. the book ends with an elderly andromache, dex, astyanax and her grandson dios. andromache lights helikaons funeral pyre, the xanthos, and watches the boat drift into the west. the book was finished by david gemmell's wife, stella, after david's death: interview with stella in the times it:la caduta dei re pl:troja: upadek królów ||| 2 ||| 2

although the character appeared previously in barrie's book the little white bird, the play and the novel based on it contain the portion of the peter pan mythos that is best known. the two versions differ in some details of the story, but have much in common. in both versions peter makes night-time calls on kensington, london, listening in on mrs. mary darling's bedtime stories by the open window. one night peter is spotted and, while trying to escape, he loses his shadow. on returning to claim it, peter wakes mary's daughter, wendy darling. wendy succeeds in re-attaching his shadow to him, and peter learns that she knows lots of bedtime stories. he invites her to neverland to be a mother to his gang, the lost boys, children who were lost in kensington gardens. wendy agrees, and her brothers john and michael go along. their magical flight to neverland is followed by many adventures. the children are blown out of the air by a cannon and wendy is nearly killed by the lost boy tootles. peter and the lost boys build a little house for wendy to live in while she recuperates (a structure that, to this day, is called a wendy house.) soon john and michael adopt the ways of the lost boys. peter welcomes wendy to his underground home, and she immediately assumes the role of mother figure. peter takes the darlings on several adventures, the first truly dangerous one occurring at mermaids' lagoon. at mermaids' lagoon, peter and the lost boys save the princess tiger lily and become involved in a battle with the pirates, including the evil captain hook. peter is wounded when hook claws him. he believes he will die, stranded on a rock when the tide is rising, but he views death as "an awfully big adventure". luckily, a bird allows him to use her nest as a boat, and peter sails home. because he has saved tiger lily, the indians are devoted to him, guarding his home from the next imminent pirate attack. meanwhile, wendy begins to fall in love with peter, at least as a child, and asks peter what kind of feelings he has for her. peter says that he is like her faithful son. one day while telling stories to the lost boys and her brothers, john and michael, wendy recalls about her parents and then decides to take them back and return to england. unfortunately, and unbeknownst to peter, wendy and the boys are captured by captain hook, who also tries to poison peter's medicine while the boy is asleep. when peter awakes, he learns from the fairy tinker bell that wendy has been kidnapped – in an effort to please wendy, he goes to drink his medicine. tink does not have time to warn him of the poison, and instead drinks it herself, causing her near death. tink tells him she could be saved if children believed in fairies. in one of the play's most famous moments, peter turns to the audience watching the play and begs those who believe in fairies to clap their hands. at this there is usually an explosion of handclapping from the audience, and tinker bell is saved. peter heads to the ship. on the way, he encounters the ticking crocodile; peter decides to copy the tick, so any animals will recognise it and leave him unharmed. he does not realise that he is still ticking as he boards the ship, where hook cowers, mistaking him for the crocodile. while the pirates are searching for the croc, peter sneaks into the cabin to steal the keys and frees the lost boys. when the pirates investigate a noise in the cabin, peter defeats them. when he finally reveals himself, he and hook fall to the climactic battle, which peter easily wins. he kicks hook into the jaws of the waiting crocodile, and hook dies with the satisfaction that peter had kicked him off the ship, which hook considers "bad form". then peter takes control of the ship, and sails the seas back to london. in the end, wendy decides that her place is at home, much to the joy of her heartsick mother. wendy then brings all the boys but peter back to london. before wendy and her brothers arrive at their house, peter flies ahead, to try and bar the window so wendy will think her mother has forgotten her. but when he learns of mrs darling's distress, he bitterly leaves the window open and flies away. peter returns briefly, and he meets mrs. darling, who has agreed to adopt the lost boys. she offers to adopt peter as well, but peter refuses, afraid they will "catch him and make him a man". it is hinted that mary darling knew peter when she was a girl, because she is left slightly changed when peter leaves. peter promises to return for wendy every spring. the end of the play finds wendy looking out through the window and saying into space, "you won't forget to come for me, peter? please, please don't forget". ||| 2 ||| 7
it is eighteen years after the end of the company war, at least as stationers experience time, less for merchanters subject to the effects of time dilation in the course of their travels. regardless, the threat of the piratical mazianni is ebbing. the neiharts and their superfreighter finity's end had spent the post-war years assisting the alliance militia hunt down the renegades. but now the oldest of all existing merchanter families wants to return to trading. when the ship docks at pell station, the heart of the alliance, the family retrieves one of its own. fletcher neihart's mother had been stranded there by the fortunes of war, giving birth to him on the station. unable to adjust to stationer life, she had committed suicide when he was five years old, leaving him to suffer through a succession of foster homes. the lonely outsider had been befriended by a couple of hisa, the gentle, intelligent natives of pell's world. now a young man of seventeen with dreams of working on the planet and no wish to take up the family business, he is furious when he is handed over against his will to his relatives as part of a deal between elene quen, stationmaster of pell, and senior captain james robert neihart. finity's end had suffered enormous casualties in the war and afterwards; half the crew died in one catastrophic decompression. due to this and also because it was impractical to raise children in wartime, the youngest generation consists of only three orphaned "junior-juniors": jeremy (fletcher's new roommate), vince and linda. fletcher should have been in the same age group, but due to time dilation, he is four or five years older. fletcher is a surly anomaly; he is as old as the more numerous "senior-juniors", but has less shipboard knowledge and experience than the junior-juniors. this is finally resolved by putting him in charge of the three youngsters. despite a botched, unofficial initiation that results in a fistfight between fletcher and chad, a senior-junior cousin, the responsibility (and implied trust) as well as his friendship with jeremy gradually reconcile him to his new life. even the initially hostile vince and linda look to him for leadership and approval. it all comes crashing down when fletcher's spirit stick, a valuable gift from the hisa satin (from downbelow station), is stolen. suspicion and distrust grow on both sides. when chad provokes another fight, jeremy finally confesses that he was responsible. to safeguard the artifact from resentful relatives, he had hidden it in his hotel room at their last stop, mariner, only to have it stolen. the merchanter champlain is one of the suspects. meanwhile, captain neihart has vastly more important issues to deal with. he is trying to shut down the smugglers and the black market, from which the mazianni resupply themselves. at every port of call, he forges agreements with merchanters, union and stationmasters to bring about a transition to peacetime, legitimate trade. when they find champlain docked at their next stop, esperance, jeremy drags fletcher to various curio stores, hoping to find the spirit stick. he succeeds, but as the senior captains are locked in vital negotiations, fletcher is instructed to keep his charges in the sleepover to wait. however, the impatient twelve-year-old jeremy takes it upon himself to go back to the shop and try to shoplift it, leading to his capture. fletcher attempts to rescue jeremy but is caught as well. as they are being led away at gunpoint to be quietly disposed of, fletcher manages to engineer their escape. the resulting investigation pressures the corrupt, reluctant stationmaster into agreeing with captain neihart's proposals. fletcher wins the approval of his family and he accepts finity's end as his new home. ||| 5 ||| 5

central to this book is the tension created by ayla's healing art, her pregnancy, and the acceptance of her by jondalar's people, the zelandonii. ayla was raised by clan neanderthals, known as "flatheads" to the zelandonii and viewed as no better than animals. for the zelandonii to accept ayla they must first overcome their prejudice against the neanderthals. luckily for ayla and jondalar, some of the higher-ranking zelandonii already have doubts of this misjudgment. two of their number, echozar and brukeval, are of partial neanderthal ancestry and are ashamed of it. echozar at least is pacified by ayla's own story and by his (echozar's) own marriage to joplaya, jondalar's close-cousin (half-sister). brukeval, on the other hand, rejects his heritage utterly and refuses to listen to reason. jondalar's first romantic interest, zelandoni, formerly known as zolena, has now become the first among the spiritual leaders. she supports adopting ayla into their society, if not least for the healing arts she brings to the cave, although ayla also must overcome the feeling that she is uncomfortable with a full connection with the spirit world. after ayla helps a mortally injured hunter live long enough to see his mate, the first senses that ayla needs to be brought into the fold of the zelandonia (mystics, named after their culture so as to identify themselves with it) so that she will be accepted as a healer by all the people of the cave. at one point, ayla persuades the native mothers to nurse a neglected infant, on the pretext that even a "flathead" would have done so in their place. this both shames them into agreeing (as noted by jondalar's sister-in-law, proleva) and educates the zelandonii in the ways of their ex-neighbors. ayla is drawn ever closer to an as-yet-undetermined role in the ninth cave of the zelandonii. her knowledge of the healing arts as well as hunting force her to accept a role in the spiritual leadership of the group. through it all jondalar is waiting for the summer meeting and matrimonial that will finally "tie the knot" for the two of them. this has been his ultimate goal since the valley of horses. their daughter, jonayla, named for her mother's belief a man's "essence" creates babies, which leads to jondalar and ayla each being part of the baby, not just their spirits, is born sometime after this event. not long after the birth, ayla finally decides to become zelandonii's acolyte, if only so that the members of the zelandonii will accept her as a healer. this book is set in what is now the vézère valley, near to les eyzies, in the dordogne, southwest france. it was relatively densely populated in prehistoric times, with many open cliff-top dwellings that can still be seen, some of which have been turned into tourist attractions. the national museum of prehistory is located in this valley. ayla also discovers the world-famous cave of lascaux, which her adopted people subsequently paint. <!-- ||| 2 ||| 5

everyone poops is essentially plotless. the first sixteen pages contain various prompts regarding defecation in animals such as opposites ("an elephant makes a big poop" and "[a] mouse makes a tiny poop"), comparisons (that various species produce various sizes and shapes of poop) and questions ("what does whale poop look like?"). on the seventeenth page, a nameless boy with black overalls and a red shirt is introduced, seen running into a bathroom. the book then goes on to explain how people of all ages, from adult to very young child, defecate, and how infants may use diapers. after that, there are only three more illustrations that lack the nameless overall-clad boy. on the next page of the book, the child uses toilet paper and flushes the toilet. the final portion of the book explains that because every animal eats, it must therefore defecate, and the book ends with rear views of the boy and six different animals defecating and the words "everyone poops". ||| 0 ||| 0

quadriplegic disability. whilst there they are approached by a local police sheriff- jim bell, the cousin of rhyme's nypd colleague ronald bell- and asked to help in a local case of kidnap and possible rape. they believe the kidnapper to be a local orphaned boy 'garret', who is believed to be involved in a number of other murders and assaults. one of these involves a hornets nest being thrown at a woman, who suffers a heart attack after 137 stings, and dies. garret is locally nicknamed 'the insect boy', due to his incredible love of insects. at the start of the novel a nurse, lydia, is kidnapped by garret when she visits the place where the first victim- 'mary-beth' was kidnapped. a police deputy is killed by a hidden hornets nest whilst searching garrets hide-out. lincoln reluctantly agrees to help, and he and sachs track garret from the trace evidence found at the scenes. meanwhile we follow garret and lydia as he takes her back to his main hideout. after rhyme cunningly outwits garret, he is arrested and sachs is allowed to question him in order to find out where mary-beth is being hidden. garret tells her it was "the man in the tan overalls" and sachs believes him, however none of the rest of the police department do. she subsequently breaks him out of jail. the rest of the police, including rhyme, are trying to track her down, and as they come up close sachs accidentally shoots one of the deputies dead. she is distraught, and is now being hunted for murder. eventually they reach garret's safe house, where he reveals that he was lying about the man in the tan overalls, but he never meant to hurt mary-beth. once a small group of police arrive, along with thom and rhyme, they are attacked by a group of local gun-nuts who are attempting to get the reward of $2000 that mary-beth's mother has put up. they shoot several deputies dead and are eventually killed by sachs and one of the deputies, lucy. inside the hut it is revealed that thom has been shot. back in town, sachs and garret are in jail and thom is in the hospital. rhyme is curious and thinks things do not fit into place correctly, and eventually confides in bell that he believes the murders in the town are accountable to a local businessman manufacturing an illegal pesticide. anyone asking questions about why they were getting ill were killed. it is revealed that numerous deputies in the department are 'in' on the scheme, and have even helped in killing some of the townsfolk. rhyme also says that he believes that the businessman had garret's family killed, and a car crash framed, because they refused to sell the land around their house so the businessman could have shipments of the pesticide transported up the river. it is at this point that bell reveals he is in on it, and attempts to murder rhyme with a sample of the harmful pesticide they have been analyzing. lucy, the deputy who helped shoot the gun nuts earlier, is listening and they run in and restrain bell, who is frustrated to see that rhyme has tricked him and the sample of the pesticide was merely 'moonshine'. he is arrested. garret is freed, mary-beth has dropped the charges, as garret was acting to defend her. she unearths the remains of his family, and it earns her a spot on the list of people who are a risk to the business. sachs is still in jail and is accepting a guilty plea in return for a reduced sentence of 5 years in prison. she is about to be sentenced when rhyme bursts in with evidence that the deputy she shot was in on the murders, allowing sachs to be freed on the grounds that her victim was a criminal engaged in pursuit of an officer and thus legitimately making her 'crime' self-defence. later, rhyme is in hospital, thom is going to live and rhyme is going to undergo the major spine surgery he has postponed while he searched for mary-beth. as he is wheeled in, lydia, the nurse who had been kidnapped earlier, follows him in apparently to thank him and wish him luck. as he is going under anesthesia she reveals to him that she was the sheriff's mistress, and had been reporting who in the town had developed cancer due to pesticide poisoning so that those people could be silenced. as he is trying to fight off the effects of the anesthesia she ominously tells him "accidents happen in spinal surgery". luckily sachs notices that lydia entered a closed surgery ward, and remembers that she is not a neurosurgery nurse, but an oncology nurse, and runs in, realizing what is going to happen. the novel ends with rhyme, sachs, lucy, thom and garret in the local cemetery. they are burying the remains of garret's family. it is hinted that lucy is to become garret's foster mother. rhyme does not have the surgery and is now back on the ventilator, after going into shock as lydia attempted to stop his oxygen flow, requiring another year to regain his original physical status until he is fit to have the operation again. ||| 6 ||| 6
the story is based upon two schoolgirls, hailey and claire, who have lived as neighbors and best friends for many years. their favorite place for amusement has been the capri beach club for as long as they can remember. however, the capri beach club has become ruinous via neglect by its staff. when claire's grandparents, with whom she lives, decide to leave the area and move to florida, the girls are dismayed. they spend hours trying to make their last days together as long as possible, both frightened by the future. when a violent thunderstorm occurs, a large quantity of trash is deposited in the capri beach club. in the swimming pool, hailey and claire discover the spoiled yet beautiful creature that will change their lives: a mermaid named aquamarine. the next morning, aquamarine surfaces after some hesitation, being stimulated to do so by the presence of the handsome raymond. during the night, aquamarine has undergone mild hardships; she has eaten very little, has been separated from her six sisters, and is suffering from the chlorine in the pool. hailey and claire advise aquamarine to return to the ocean, however she refuses, because of her new attachment to raymond. claire and hailey read books that contain information pertaining to marine life-forms, trying to find an answer to aquamarine's troubling conditions. they learn that mermaids cannot survive on land for more than a week. the necessity of returning aquamarine to the ocean is thus made more urgent. in order to persuade aquamarine to return to her home, hailey and claire arrange that she will spend one evening with raymond, after which she must leave. to compensate for her nudity and lack of legs, they plan to dress her in a long blue gown and place her in a wheelchair. before the meeting, the two girls confide their story in claire's grandfather, maury. he believes their story because of his own encounter with a mermaid once. he takes them to the capri beach club, where they organize the table and food for aquamarine and raymond. they then lift aquamarine out of the pool – an operation wherein claire must overcome a hesitation to enter water – and introduce her to raymond. to explain her acquaintance with them, they present her as a distant cousin. raymond is awestruck by aquamarine, with whom he spends the evening happily. meanwhile, claire and hailey begin to embrace their future and rekindle their hope. at 9 o'clock, they take aquamarine back to the swimming pool. as she leaves, aquamarine gives raymond a seashell, by which to contact her by speaking her name into it; she will hear this call regardless of their relative positions. hailey and claire sleep together in claire's soon-to-be-vacant house, which has been made empty of furniture. they have by now grown very fond of aquamarine, and she of them. hailey and claire arrive to take aquamarine back to the ocean. they meet raymond, who regrets that he cannot bid aquamarine farewell before he leaves for florida. just then, a boy named arthur falls into the swimming pool. aquamarine rescues him, with the help of raymond. raymond, seeing her tail and thus realizing she is a mermaid, is utterly shocked, however, this discovery does nothing to impair his adoration of her. hailey and claire carry aquamarine to the ocean and cast her into the water, where she is restored to full health and strength. they promise never to forget her and return to the capri beach club, thanking its owner for the best summer of their lives. claire and her grandparents later move away to florida. after her departure, the capri beach club is dismembered. hailey does not send news of this, wishing that claire retain her memory of the capri beach club as it had formerly been. in florida, claire learns to swim and encounters raymond, who has come to live nearby. from him, she learns that aquamarine is in the vicinity. claire thinks to take a photograph of the mermaid, but defers on the grounds that hailey will soon visit. in 2006 a movie was made of the popular novel with some differences. ||| 7 ||| 2
at the beginning of this book the children's father, a journalist, has gone overseas to cover the war in manchuria. their mother has gone to madeira to recuperate from an illness, taking with her their younger brother, the lamb. the children are living with an old nurse who has set up a boardinghouse in central london. her only remaining boarder is a scholarly egyptologist who has filled his bedsit with ancient artifacts. during the course of the book, the children get to know the "poor learned gentleman" and befriend him and call him jimmy. cook's house is in fitzrovia, the district of london near the british museum, which nesbit accurately conveys as having bookstalls and shops filled with unusual merchandise. in one of these shops the children find the psammead. it had been captured by a trapper, who failed to recognise it as a magical being. the terrified creature cannot escape, for it can only grant wishes to others, not to itself. using a ruse, the children persuade the shopkeeper to sell them the "mangy old monkey," and they free their old friend. guided by the psammead the children purchase an ancient amulet in the shape of an egyptian tyet (a small amulet of very similar shape to the picture can be seen in the british museum today http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/r/red_jasper_tit_amulet_of_nefer.aspx), which should be able to grant them their hearts' desire: the safe return of their parents and baby brother. but this amulet is only the surviving half of an original whole. by itself, it cannot grant their hearts' desire. yet it can serve as a portal, enabling time travel to find the other half. in the course of the novel the amulet transports the children and the psammead to times and places where the amulet has previously existed, in the hope that — somewhen in time — the children can find the amulet's missing half. among the ancient realms they visit are babylon, egypt, the phoenician city of tyre, a ship to "the tin islands" (ancient cornwall), and atlantis just before the flood. in one chapter, they meet julius caesar on the shores of gaul, just as he has decided that britain is not worth invading. jane's childish prattling about the glories of england persuades caesar to invade after all. in each of their time-jaunts, the children are magically able to speak and comprehend the contemporary language. nesbit acknowledges this in her narration, without offering any explanation. the children eventually bring "jimmy" along with them on some of their time trips. for some reason, jimmy does not share the children's magical gift of fluency in the local language: he can only understand (for example) latin based on his own studies. in one chapter the children also come to the future, visiting a british utopia in which h.g. wells is venerated as a prophet. wells and e. nesbit were both members of the fabian political movement, as was george bernard shaw, and this chapter in the story of the amulet is essentially different from all the other trips in the narrative: whereas all the other adventures in this novel contain scrupulously detailed accounts of past civilisations, the children's trip into the future represents nesbit's vision of utopia. this episode can be compared to many other visions of utopian socialist futures published in that era; nesbit's is notable in that it concentrates on how the life of children at school would be radically different, with economic changes only appearing briefly in the background. (it seems somewhat akin to william morris's news from nowhere.) it also mentions a pressing danger of edwardian england: the number of children wounded, burned, and killed each year. (this concern was addressed in the children act 1908, and later in the children's charter.) ||| 2 ||| 2
on his deathbed, baron lavenham arranges a marriage between his great-nephew, sir tristram shield, and his young french granddaughter, eustacie de vauban. his grandson and heir, ludovic, is on the run on the continent, after allegedly murdering a man in a dispute over a valuable heirloom, the talisman ring. the romantic eustacie, appalled by her betrothed's phlegmatic character, runs away and soon encounters a smuggler, who turns out to be her cousin ludovic. the two take refuge at a local inn, after ludovic is injured escaping from excisemen. there they encounter an older lady, miss sarah thane, who vows to help them. after finding her bandboxes and meeting the excisemen following the smugglers on the blood trail from ludovic's injury, tristram decides to follow them under the impression that eustacie encountered trouble from the smugglers. at the hotel, against sarah thane's efforts he conducts the excisemen towards eustacie and ludovic. tristram recognizes him, but leads the others to believe that he is one of lord sylvester's bastards, much to the former's crossness, to account for the resemblance. when they leave he examines ludovic's hands and pronounces innocence as the ring is not on them. together with sarah thane, now a loyal accomplice and eustacie's self-appointed chaperon, they conclude that the murderer is no other than basil and hatch a plan to break into his home at the dower house. on the course of the next days tristram spreads the word that eustacie ran to meet sarah thane whom she knew from paris to smooth over the ripples of her escape. it is concluded that eustacie will stay with sarah, to protect ludovic, and thus basil pays her a visit there. during the discussion eustacie pretends that for architectural reasons sarah would very much like to visit the dower house and basil invites them both there. they go and after a while they are joined by tristram whom basil "sends" to show miss thane the house around when eustacie requests that they talk in private. they leave without finding the ring but the butler, having seem them knock on the panels in the house, shares that to basil who understands at once that they know. recollecting that his butler has spoken to the excisemen he asks for the appearance of the "bastard" and realizing who it is calls in the bow street runners. the residents of the red lion inn get rid of them after making them believe that sarah is ludovic dressed in women's clothes and professing indulgence on their blunder. basil then lays a trap announcing that he is going to london. hearing this, ludovic tries, against all advice to break into the house and escapes later with the help of tristram, summoned by miss thane. basil next tries to break into the inn and kill ludovic but is stopped by sir hugh, and in the struggle, he loses a quizzing glass. the next morning sir tristram realizes that the quizzing glass is rather disproportionate and after several tries he finds the ring in the shaft. the next morning he calls the bow street runners and lays a trap for basil who, while trying to escape, punches miss thane on the temple. she wakes up with tristram is nursing her, and is rather annoyed when he proposes to her in her state, tough she confesses later on "i have been meaning to marry you these ten days and more!”. ||| 6 ||| 2
trot is near her home on the coast of southern california when she meets a strange little boy with a large umbrella. button bright has been using his family's magic umbrella to take long-range journeys from his philadelphia home, and has gotten as far as california. after an explanation of how the magic umbrella works, the two children, joined by cap'n bill, decide to take a trip to a nearby island; they call it "sky island," because it looks like it's "halfway in the sky" &mdash; but the umbrella takes them to a different place entirely, a literal island in the sky. sky island is another split-color country in baum's fantasy universe, like the land of oz or the island of yew (in the enchanted island of yew, from 1903). divided in two halves, blue and pink, sky island supports two separate and hostile races of beings. the three travellers land on the blue side of sky island, which is a grim country ruled by a sadistic tyrant, the boolooroo of the blues. in sky island, as in oz, no one can be killed or suffer pain, but that doesn't mean one is safe: the boolooroo's method of punishing disobedience in his subjects is to split his victims into halves using a huge guillotine-type knife, and then join the wrong halves back together, creating very unhappy asymmetrical mixed people. this is called "patching." the boolooroo threatens to do the same to his new visitors; meanwhile he keeps them imprisoned, and gives trot as a slave to his daughters, the six snubnosed princesses (named cerulia, turquoise, sapphire, azure, cobalt, and indigo). the three protagonists manage to escape from the blues; penetrating the great fog bank that separates the island's halves and meeting its strange inhabitants, they reach the pink or "sunrise" side of the island. the pink country is a much friendlier and more relaxed place than the blue side, with cheerfully chubby residents. the visitors get a better reception, since they are rather pink in color themselves, albeit of a sadly wan and pale shade. unfortunately, the laws of the pink country insist that the visitors be thrown off the edge of sky island; even the country's ruler, the sylph-like tourmaline the poverty queen, cannot pardon them. polychrome, however, descends from the rainbow like a deus ex machina to resolve the problem. trot is promoted to queen of the pinkies, because she has the palest skin among them. after cap'n bill leads an invasion of the opposite side, trot becomes "booloorooess" of the blues as well; and so she is able to "regulate" both societies into more sensible forms. the three travellers eventually return to their homes, more than a little relieved at their escape from sky island. the bipartite structure of sky island allows baum to inject ironic and satiric commentary on xenophobia, isolationism, race and color prejudice, social biases, personal vanity, and related issues. the blues think that their dismal island-half "is the center of the universe and the only place anyone would care to live." their scientists have "proven" that the earth below, a ball of mud and water, cannot support life. the snubnosed princesses think that a snub nose is "the highest mark of female beauty" and "an evidence of high breeding which any lady would be proud to possess." ||| 0 ||| 2
mickey haller, who has become increasingly frustrated in his role as a defense lawyer, agrees to undertake the prosecution role on behalf of the city of los angeles, in the retrial of a convicted killer that had been granted as a result of new dna evidence. his one condition before accepting the task is that he is permitted to choose his own team; he chooses his ex-wife maggie mcpherson as his co-prosecutor, and his half-brother harry bosch as his investigator from the lapd. the prosecution case rests largely on the testimony of sarah gleason, the elder sister of the victim, melissa landy. the body of 12-year-old melissa was discovered in 1986, discarded in a dumpster, only a few hours after she was reported missing. unknown to the killer, her sister sarah had been hiding in the garden and had witnessed her abduction. on the day of the murder, she identified jason jessup, a truck driver, as the man who snatched melissa from the garden. dna evidence subsequently showed that semen stains on the dress melissa was wearing came not from jessup, but from the girls' stepfather. however, the evidence against jessup includes strands of melissa's hair, found in the seat of his truck. jessup's defense counsel, "clever" clive royce, mounts a media campaign in his client's favour, and it becomes clear that their main motivation is in obtaining a compensation payout from the state. haller's response is to allow bail and have jessup tailed by the police in the hope that he will return to his old ways and provide additional support for the prosecution case. jessup is soon seen visiting various mountain trails in the mulholland area, and on one occasion parks his car outside bosch's house at night. bosch and haller, both concerned for their own teenage daughters, develop a theory that jessup was a serial killer but are unable to investigate fully for fear of blowing the police's cover. legal procedures require that the jury is kept ignorant of jessup's history. testimony given in the original trial, where the witness is no longer available because of death or infirmity, has to be read out by harry bosch. after sarah gleason admits that the dress melissa was wearing was hers and that her stepfather was raping her, which accounted for the semen stains, the defense focuses on presenting the stepfather as the real killer and jessup as the victim of the family's lies. the focus is to undermine sarah's testimony, because of her a history of drug use and prostitution in the years since her sister's murder, though she has now been rehabilitated. bosch traces sarah's former lover, eddie roman, and finds that he has remained a drug addict living off a prostitute's earnings but has disappeared, presumably to testify falsely against sarah. locating roman's current prostitute sonia reyes, bosch persuades her to enter the courtroom at a crucial moment in roman's testimony, which causes roman to alter his testimony, effectively destroying the defense case. while anticipating a plea bargain offer from the defense team during a lunch break, bosch and haller instead learn that jessup entered royce's offices with a gun and killed royce, two of his legal team and a policeman who followed him. jessup is now at large, but the police surround and kill him at a hideout under the santa monica pier that had been discovered by bosch as a result of the police surveillance activities. jessup's death ends the search for melissa landy's killer, but leaves the prosecution team with a host of unanswered legal and moral questions. ||| 3 ||| 6

the third policeman is set in rural ireland and is narrated by a dedicated amateur scholar of de selby, a scientist and philosopher. the narrator, whose name we never learn, is orphaned at a young age. at boarding school, he discovers the work of de selby and becomes a fanatically dedicated student of it. one night he breaks his leg under mysterious circumstances – "if you like, it was broken for me" – and he is ultimately fitted with a wooden leg to replace the original one. on returning to his family home, he meets and befriends john divney who is in charge of the family farm and pub. over the next few years, the narrator devotes himself to the study of de selby's work and leaves divney to run the family business. by the time the narrator is thirty, he has written what he believes to be the definitive critical work on de selby, but does not have enough money to publish the work. divney observes that mathers, a local man, "is worth a packet of potato-meal" and eventually it dawns on the narrator that divney plans to rob and kill mathers. the narrator and divney encounter mathers one night on the road and divney knocks mathers down with a bicycle pump. the narrator, prompted by divney, finishes mathers off with a spade, and then notices that divney has disappeared with mathers's cash box. when divney returns he refuses to reveal where the cash box is, and fends off the narrator's repeated inquiries. to ensure that divney does not retrieve the box unobserved, the narrator becomes more and more inseparable from divney, eventually sharing a bed with him: "the situation was a queer one and neither of us liked it". three years pass, in which the previously amicable relationship between the narrator and divney breaks down. eventually divney reveals that the box is hidden under the floorboards in mathers's old house, and instructs the narrator to fetch it. the narrator follows divney's instructions but just as he reaches for the box, "something happened":it was as if the daylight had changed with unnatural suddenness, as if the temperature of the evening had altered greatly in an instant or as if the air had become twice as rare or twice as dense as it had been in the winking of an eye; perhaps all of these and other things happened together for all my senses were bewildered all at once and could give me no explanation. the box has disappeared, and the narrator is perplexed to notice that mathers is in the room with him. during a surreal conversation with the apparently deceased mathers, the narrator hears another voice speaking to him which he realises is his soul: &#34;for convenience i called him joe.&#34; the narrator is bent on finding the cash box, and when mathers tells him about a remarkable police barracks nearby he resolves to go to the barracks and enlist the help of the police in finding the box. on the way, he meets a one-legged bandit named martin finnucane, who threatens to kill him but who becomes his friend upon finding out that his potential victim is also one-legged. the narrator approaches the police barracks and is disturbed by its appearance:it looked as if it were painted like an advertisement on a board on the roadside and indeed very poorly painted. it looked completely false and unconvincing. inside the barracks he meets two of the three policemen, sergeant pluck and policeman maccruiskeen, who speak largely in non sequitur and who are entirely obsessed with bicycles. there he is introduced to various peculiar or irrational concepts, artifacts, and locations, including a contraption that collects sound and converts it to light based on a theory regarding omnium, the fundamental energy of the universe; a vast underground chamber called &#39;eternity,&#39; where time stands still, mysterious numbers are devoutly recorded and worried about by the policemen; a box from which anything you desire can be produced; and an intricate carved chest containing a series of identical but smaller chests. the infinite nature of this last device causes the narrator great mental and spiritual discomfort. it is later discovered that mathers has been found dead and eviscerated in a ditch. joe suspects martin finnucane, but to the narrator&#39;s dismay he himself is charged with the crime because he is the most convenient suspect. he argues with sergeant pluck that since he is nameless, and therefore, as pluck observed, &#34;invisible to the law&#34;, he cannot be charged with anything. pluck is surprised, but after he unsuccessfully attempts to guess the narrator&#39;s name he reasons that since the narrator is nameless he is not really a person, and can therefore be hanged without fear of repercussions:the particular death you die is not even a death (which is an inferior phenomenon at best) only an insanitary abstraction in the backyard[...]. the narrator calls on the help of finnucane, but his rescue is thwarted by maccruiskeen riding a bicycle painted an unknown colour which drives those who see it mad. he faces the gallows, but the two policemen are called away by dangerously high readings in the underground chamber. the following day he escapes from the barracks on a bicycle of unusual perfection. as he rides through the countryside, he passes mathers&#39;s house and sees a light. disturbed, he enters the house and finally meets the mysterious and reportedly all-powerful third policeman, fox, who has the face of mathers. fox&#39;s secret police station is in the walls of mathers&#39;s house. he tells the narrator that he is the architect of the readings in the underground chamber, which he alters for his amusement, thereby inadvertently saving the narrator&#39;s life. fox goes on to tell the narrator that he found the cash box and has sent it to the narrator&#39;s home, where it is waiting for him. he also reveals that the box contains not money but omnium, which can become anything he desires. divney can see the narrator, although the others cannot, and he has a heart attack from the shock. he shouts that the narrator was supposed to be dead, for the black box was not filled with money but a bomb and it exploded when the narrator reached for it. the narrator leaves divney on the floor, apparently dying. feeling &#34;sad, empty and without a thought&#34;, the narrator leaves the house and walks away down the road. he soon approaches the police barracks, the book using exactly the same words to describe the barracks and the narrator&#39;s opinion of it that were used earlier, the story having circled around itself and restarted. this time, john divney joins the narrator on the road; they neither look at nor speak to each other. they both enter the police station and are confronted by sergeant pluck, who repeats his earlier dialogue and ends the book with a reprise of his original greeting to the narrator:"is it about a bicycle?" he asked. ||| 3 ||| 6
odile von rothbart is a young sorceress in training under her father's tutelage. she adores and respects him, at least in part because he has taught her that women are meant to be loyal to men. living in the gardens is the "flock;" the group of young women rothbart has ensorceled because they were unfaithful to their husbands or fathers. they are under a curse which compels them to become swans by day and women only during moonlit hours. the most beautiful and noble of these is princess odette, the queen of swans. odile is restless because her father seldom praises her, even though (or perhaps because) she is growing to be his equal in magic. she has never seen much of the world outside her father's estate, but she knows she would like the company of other people. she has no interest in the swans because they seem to lack her intelligence, and because rothbart has taught her to despise them. when odette openly defies rothbart, challenging him to give a convincing reason for his punishment of the flock, he offers her a deal; if she can capture and hold the loyalty of a man for an entire month, the curse which keeps the flock captive will be broken. a condition of the deal is that the young man must know exactly what odette had done (refused the engagement her father had set for her and run away with a member of the court) and still pledge his loyalty to her. rothbart then leads the flock, plus odile, on a long journey to siegfried's kingdom. in the secondary plot, queen clothilde is a competent but ruthless woman acting as regent for siegfried. she does not want to surrender power to her son when he turns 18; an event mere months away. she plans a birthday celebration for him at which six beautiful princesses, all prospective brides, will attend, hoping to distract him from his kingship. clothilde secretly hopes to kill siegfried and either take the throne in right or continue as regent for a grandchild. she is aided in her scheme by uwe, her minstrel and former lover. siegfried himself is a womanizer and a scoundrel, but a religious experience convinces him to change his ways. clothilde is dismayed, since the reformed siegfried is winning the respect of her court. baron rothbart pays a visit to clothilde and requests that his own daughter be allowed to attend the festival as a potential bride. she agrees, tempted by the prospect of having a sorcerer readily at hand. the flock arrives at a small lake. odile, who has largely been in charge of their care, is getting to know the swan maidens and feels some sympathy for them. she wants odette to succeed because she thinks she and her father would have more freedom to travel if the swan-maidens were no longer their burden. siegfried, sent out hunting by his mother in search of swans, encounters odette, and it is love at first sight. his friend benno, returning to the lake by daylight to investigate, is quickly dismissed by odile. when both men return to the lake at night, odette is able to allay their suspicions that she is some sort of witch. she tells siegfried why she has been cursed, and he agrees to marry her and thus break the curse. happily, odile tells her father that odette has fulfilled her part of the bargain. the next day is the day of the fête where siegfried will choose his bride. odette leaves the flock in the morning to find him. rothbart and odile also attend, odile having little idea what to expect. her father casts a spell on her which makes her look like odette and controls her with more magic, keeping her from warning siegfried. the prince declares his desire to marry "the daughter of baron rothbart," which breaks the vow he made to odette. worst of all, odette arrives just in time to witness this. she flees, siegfried follows, and odile runs after them both. rothbart reveals that his aim the entire time has been to deliver judgment on clothilde, since he knew she was plotting to kill her own son. he brings part of the great hall down on her and uwe, who lives just long enough to reveal the plot to benno and the court. at the lake, rothbart taunts siegfried and odette, while odile watches from concealment. at a crucial moment, she kills him with his own dagger, then rescues odette and siegfried, who have jumped into the lake to drown together rather than be separated. when the sun rises, the girls remain girls, indicating that rothbart's spell has died with him. odette marries siegfried and gives odile a position on her council. odile and benno appear to be falling in love. ||| 2 ||| 2
the fitz chivalry has survived his first treacherous foray as an assassin, but barely. the poison used by the ambitious prince regal has left fitz weak and prone to unpredictable seizures. fitz vows to never return to buckkeep and his king. a vision of the young woman he loves fending off an attack by the merciless red-ship raiders convinces fitz otherwise, and he rouses himself to go back to the royal court of the six duchies. upon his return to buckkeep, fitz is immediately embroild in the intrigues of the royal family. at least his beloved molly is alive, but she has been left a pauper by her father's death and debts, forced into service as a lady's maid at the keep. fitz finally admits his love to her, and she to him. their happiness is short-lived; when he approaches the ailing king shrewd for permission to marry, the king tells him in no uncertain terms that fitz will be pledged to the daughter of a duke. he and molly are left to conduct their courtship in secret, not only because of shrewd's command, but to keep molly safe from fitz's enemies at the court. fitz is more vulnerable now than ever to those enemies. king-in-waiting verity is consumed by the need to protect the duchies' coast from the red-ships, using his skill to stave off raider attacks but failing miserably to give any attention to his new mountain queen. king shrewd suffers a mysterious wasting disease whose pain only mind-clouding drugs can abate. bands of forged ones, six duchies folk rendered soulless murderers by the raiders, begin to converge on the keep. verity puts fitz again in the role of unseen assassin, commanding him to hunt down the forged. this fitz does with the help of a young wolf he has rescued and bonded with in the forbidden way of the wit. regal and his lackeys come very close to discovering that fitz is witted, and fitz must put guards upon his mind to protect this one of his many secrets. with so many duties taking all his time, fitz can find little time for molly. when she tells him that she is leaving him and buck forever for the sake of another, fitz desperately reveals the biggest thing he has held back from her. hoping that by sharing the secret of his true duties he can change molly's mind, he tells her that he is an assassin. molly is instead repulsed and utterly rejects fitz with heartbreaking finality. despite this huge personal loss, fitz rallies his loyalty to his king and kingdom. greater threats to the kingdom than the raiders and the forged ones are the traitors within the court itself. the raiders grow bolder, and unsent messages and late warnings leave the coastal duchies easy prey. verity decides to leave buckkeep to try to gain the help of the legendary elderlings. many folks see this as a fool's errand, and as it leaves regal free to work his plots more easily, it may be. the ailing king grows more weakened and addled every day, and regal begins amassing power and loyalty to himself. fitz and verity's queen leave to quell a raider attack on one of the coastal duchies. while they are gone, regal makes his move. he says that word has come that verity is dead, and makes himself king-in-waiting. using his mostly uncontrollable skill, fitz discovers that verity is still alive. to utter this now at the court where regal held power would mean quick death. after an attempt is made on the life of verity's unborn heir, fitz and his mentors chade and burrich make plans to spirit king shrewd and verity's pregnant queen-in-waiting safely out of regal's reach. the king dies in an attempt to skill to verity before the plans can be carried out. fitz is accused of regicide, but not before he gets a glimpse of the true source of the king's long illness and death. imprisoned and accused also of using the forbidden wit, fitz has only one chance at cheating regal out of a complete victory and at saving at least something of himself. ||| 2 ||| 2

after receiving a heart transplant, retired fbi criminal profiler terrell "terry" mccaleb is contacted by graciela rivers, the sister of his donor gloria, and asked to investigate her death, which occurred during an unsolved convenience store robbery. mccaleb had become a minor celebrity as the head of the fbi task force on the "code killer", an l.a.-based serial killer (similar to the zodiac killer) who always signed his notes with the code "903 472 568", but he is now living on his fishing boat and has been inactive to prevent rejection of his new heart (to the extent that he cannot even drive). he reluctantly agrees to help graciela but finds the police handling the case to be extremely hostile. however, he is able to match the style of another killing to gloria's and gets a copy of the files for both cases from jaye winston, the sheriff's deputy on that case. he surprisingly discovers that the call reporting gloria's shooting was placed slightly prior to the actual shooting, leading him to suspect that gloria was targeted for murder. he interviews the only witness to the second crime, a man called james noone, but fails to learn much. as he continues to investigate, with winston's support but against the wishes of his doctor, he finds that the two cases plus a third case are linked through the use of a common gun and a common line said by the killer after the shooting, "don't forget the cannoli," from the godfather. he then learns that the first two victims had mccaleb's blood types and were on a list of people who had previously donated blood. if the victims died, mccaleb would benefit from their death as a potential organ recipient. because of this, the police on gloria's case focus on him as the possible killer and get a search warrant for his boat. then, the real killer begins to plant evidence implicating mccaleb on his boat, expecting the police to find it, but mccaleb finds and then conceals the most incriminating evidence. examining the facts again, mccaleb realizes that the distinctive attribute of the "code killer" was that the nine-digit identifying code did not include a one, and that "noone" ("no one") is actually the code killer. by following the contact information on noone, mccaleb and jaye winston find the code killer's files, which prove that he had deliberately killed three people to get mccaleb a new heart. although mccaleb is thus cleared, the fact that gloria's death was directly due to his illness creates a rift in his increasingly personal relationship with graciela and her nephew raymond, gloria's son. mccaleb, who is still supposed to be inactive, secretly continues to trace the code killer from information that he learned during his interview with "noone" and drives to a location in baja california that matches one noone described. he then finds and is overpowered by the code killer, who tells him that he has kidnapped graciela and raymond and buried them alive. despite serious medical problems from so much activity, mccaleb is able to kill him and then uses the little information he has to locate and rescue graciela and raymond. upon his return, he apologizes to his doctor and says that he went to mexico because he needed a vacation. only jaye winston among the law enforcement officials figures out what really happened. ||| 1 ||| 6
thad beaumont is an author and recovering alcoholic who lives in the town of ludlow, maine. thad's own books – cerebral literary fiction – are not very successful. however, under the pen name "george stark", he writes highly successful crime novels about a violent killer named alexis machine. when thad's authorship of stark's novels becomes public knowledge, thad and his wife, elizabeth, decide to stage a mock burial for his alter ego at the local cemetery, which is featured in a people magazine article. stark's epitaph says it all: "not a very nice guy". stark, however, emerges from the mock grave as a physical entity and goes on a killing spree, gruesomely murdering everyone he perceives responsible for his "death" – thad's editor, agent, and the people interviewer, among others. thad, meanwhile, is plagued by surreal nightmares. stark's murders are investigated by alan pangborn, the sheriff of the neighboring town of castle rock, who finds thad's voice and fingerprints at the crime scenes. this evidence, and thad's unwillingness to answer his questions, causes pangborn to believe that thad – despite having alibis – is responsible for the murders. thad eventually discovers that he and stark share a mental bond, and begins to find notes from stark written in his own handwriting. the notes tell thad what activity stark has been engaging in. observing his son and daughter, thad notes that twins share a unique bond. they can feel each other's pain and at times appear to read the other's mind. using this as a keystone to his own situation, he begins to discover the even deeper meaning behind himself and stark. pangborn eventually learns that thad had a twin. the unborn brother was absorbed into thad in utero and later removed from his brain when the author was a child. he had suffered from severe headaches and it was originally thought to be a tumor causing them. the neurosurgeon who removed it found the following inside: part of a nostril, some fingernails, some teeth, and a malformed human eye. this leads to questions about the true nature of stark, whether he is a malevolent spirit with its own existence, or thad himself, manifesting an alternate personality. thad eventually vanquishes stark, but the book ends on an unhappy note with thad's wife having serious doubts about the future of their relationship: she is appalled that thad not only created stark (if unintentionally), but that a part of him liked stark. sheriff alan pangborn goes on to appear two times more in the castle rock series. it is revealed that ever since the events of the dark half, he is plagued by nightmares and the memory of thad beaumont. we are also told of the subsequent death of pangborn's wife and son, and his own depression, in needful things. in the short story the sun dog it had mentioned in passing that liz left thad, taking the twins with her. it is then revealed in bag of bones that thad committed suicide. this ties up the novel's ambiguous ending regarding thad's relationship with liz. stark is also mentioned in the "notes" section of king's collection nightmares & dreamscapes under the story "the fifth quarter". it states only "bachman again. or maybe george stark." ||| 0 ||| 6
after defeating napoleon's forces at the battle of dover, laurence and temeraire are confronted by envoys from imperial china, including prince yongxing, brother of the jiaqing emperor. the chinese are eager to get their rare celestial dragon back from the british. celestials are only allowed to accompany royalty—temeraire was intended for napoleon, emperor of the french—and laurence, a mere commoner, is deemed unworthy of temeraire by the chinese. after several failed attempts to convince laurence and the royal aerial corps to return temeraire to china, the chinese and the british agree to have temeraire and his flight crew — including laurence — accompany the imperial envoys back to china. as the land routes are deemed unsafe, the navy has a dragon transport, hms allegiance, captained by laurence's former second officer tom riley, ferry the celestial and his crew on a voyage to china. during the voyage, attempts are made on the life of laurence in order to remove him from temeraire. in addition, political machinations on the part of the british, french, and chinese are discovered that threaten the position of britain in the east, as well as the stability of the chinese throne. finally, laurence has ongoing difficulties with both captain riley, a staunch supporter of the slave trade (laurence himself descends from known abolitionists) and the diplomat arthur hammond, sent along to smooth the operation. during the sea voyage, temeraire catches a respiratory illness from volatilus, a slow-minded though sweet-natured winchester serving in the courier corps who visits the allegiance with dispatches. by use of a posset made using an extremely smelly mushroom, the cooks of the chinese delegation are able to restore temeraire to health. this event, though seemingly unimportant at the moment, shapes the next two novels of the series. after their arrival in china, temeraire gets to meet his family, including his mother, and sees the greatly improved conditions of dragonkind in china: chinese dragons are citizens in their own right and, amongst other things, may take the confucian civil service exam. he also begins courting an imperial dragon named mei. laurence, meanwhile, suffers more direct attempts on his life, including confrontations with yongxing and his companion, the albino celestial lien. hammond is able to deduce that yongxing has designs on prince mianning, the heir-apparent whose dragon is temeraire's twin brother, and that temeraire was sent to france not because the chinese esteem napoleon but so that temeraire himself could not be used to complicate the line of succession. thus, his presence is necessary to lend legitimacy to any puppet king yongxing intends to set upon the throne. at a theatre production in the british delegation's honor, yongxing attempts to put his plans in motion, but is prevented by the actions of temeraire and laurence, and is himself killed in the ensuing scuffle. as a result, the emperor of china himself adopts laurence as an honorary son, at a stroke resolving the issues with laurence's social status and easing relations with britain. temeraire, after much deliberation, decides to return to britain, partially out of love for laurence and partially to attempt to bring the greater civil liberties of china back to the commonwealth. ||| 2 ||| 2

the plot to save socrates deals primarily with the concept of time travel, and while the novel rarely discusses time travel directly, it poses several questions about its validity and possibility (or lack thereof). in particular, the characters are trapped in endless time loops, effectively deprived of free will and having no choice but to take an action which - due to time travel - they already know they have taken. the story begins in athens, greece in 2042 with the main character, sierra waters, thinking to herself, at which point the rest of the story begins as a flashback (both in her head and in the sense that the characters constantly flash in and out of historic eras). sierra waters, a graduate student, receives a copy of a previously unknown dialogue in which socrates is being offered an escape from his death sentence in ancient athens by a person named andros offering to take him into the future and leave a clone behind. the document appears to be genuine, and this takes sierra onto a path that leads her to a time traveling adventure of her own. on her path she meets up with the great historic inventor heron of alexandria but soon realizes that not only is heron a time traveler himself (from a future later than hers) but is a suspicious and ruthless character. later on she would encounter the renowned athenian general alcibiades, help save his life at the time when history records his death in 404 bc, become his lover and fall deeply in love with him, and help set him on a very extensive and fruitful later long life which would remain unknown to historians. the story tangles itself a bit as more and more characters appear to be intertwined with each other and on occasion even the same person at different points in life. however, the novel ultimately untangles itself, somewhat satisfying the plot's plausibility although leaving unanswered any deeper metaphysical qualms the reader might have. together with various fictional characters, the story also involves plato, and of course socrates - who only comes onstage in the last part - as well as the 19th century publisher william henry appleton. there are scenes across time, placed in the ancient library of alexandria, victorian new york city, and roman london. at various points it is mentioned that sierra waters would eventually become the famous mathematician hypatia of alexandria. this theme is taken up in a sequel, "unburning alexandria", of which the first two chapters were published as a standalone novelette in the november, 2008 issue of analog science fiction and fact and which had not yet been published in full as of october 2011. ||| 5 ||| 5

jermayan because of a war that will eventually start with the demons and because elf knights will live as long as she will with a war. vestakia is scared that the elves will hate and try to kill her, but jermayan promises that he will not let that happen. when they arrive, all the elves demand that vestakia be removed, but jermayan, shalkan and kellen threaten to leave if she is banned. idalia uses wild magic and a potion to discover who she is and also heals kellen. shalkan tells kellen not to look at his hands. kellen has not seen his hands since he touched the key stone. jermayan has already tried to heal them when kellen was sleeping and had told him never to take the bandages off. kellen looks anyway and sees that his hands are completely raw, with bones showing in some places. idalia, andoreniel, and the other members of the elf council pay the price to cure kellen hands in return for what he has done for them. they all go home and get ready for a grand feast for kellen, jermayan, vestakia. before the feast begins, idalia confronts jermayan and tell him she loves him and wants to be with him for the rest of their lives. jermayan wants to get married, but idalia is not sure about that. when elves marry they get linked in a special way. idalia fears that the link will tell jermayan what she turned into to stop the rain. the feast begins and kellen notices how beautiful vestakia is. even as a demon, the elves managed to make her demonic features less prominent. idalia takes vestakia away suddenly. kellen then remembers he must be chaste and celibate for a year and a day or shalkan will castrate him, as part of their previous deal. the next day kellen and idalia go to the war chamber and start making plans. the elves decided to take all elven children in the seven cities to the elven stronghold. kellen thinks they should do more, but the elves take their time at everything, including war. kellen now goes to the house of sword and stone, to gain skill in knighthood. idalia and jermayan spend time together. now when she does wild magic she does not ask for a price. she also realizes that the price of controlling the weather was her death. she thinks that there are two reasons why she does not have to pay the price. the first being that she will die soon due to the price, the second being that the price was a test, and she has already passed. meanwhile back in armethalieh, cilarnen volpiril is a top student high mage. his father is on the council with lycaelon tavadon. his father is the mage who recommended changing city limits to the very walls of the city instead of hundreds of miles outward. cilarnen finds his sister having a party in the yard and sees the lady amintia, who he falls in love with. cilarnen asks his father permission to talk to her, but he refuses, saying it will take away from his studies. the elves move prince sandalon and the other children to the elf fortress of the crowed horns escorted by ten elves and unicorns. ice trolls and other creatures take them. only one unicorn survives while all the children are kidnapped. the unicorn returns to sentarshadeen alive and warns them. kellen, impatient, tells the elves he going to rescue sandalon. kellen, idalia, jermayan, vestakia, shalkan, and six elven knights, whom kellen befriended while learning to become a knight, leave to go look for the prince. back in armethalieh, cilarnen and his friends are making a magical item to help the shortage of food in armethalieh due to the recent boundary change resulting in despondent farm-towns surrounding the city. anigerel pretends to be their friend, but then gives them away to lycaelon tardavon, who has been waiting to get cilaren's father kicked off the council of mages. cilaren blames his father for giving him ideas, and other children of council members follow suit. lycaelon adopts anigerel as he says he has no son after what kellen did. anigerel helps lycaelon get back their lands and cut off all contact with elves and other folk because they will try to warn them of the endarkened. as they are discussing this an elf from sentarshadeen comes to tell them of the endarkened. they do not give him a chance to speak and say if he does not leave they will kill him. they then banish cilarnen and do the same thing to him as they did to kellen—send the outlaw hunt after him. once he is outside he meets the elf, who says he will help him escape. kellen, idalia, jermayan, vestakia, shalkan and the knights find the place where the children are hidden. idalia has a cloak that makes people invisible and hides sound and smell and decides to go in and help them. the things that kidnapped them are half-elf half-goblin, made by the endarkened, which is why they could get into elven lands and help get others in elven lands. she gets all the children out including sandalon. however sandalon's nurse lairamo and idalia cannot fit under the cloak. lairamo takes the cloak grudgingly, leaving idalia, and goes ahead. idalia tries to be quiet but gets caught and falls off a cliff. kellen decides he, jermayan, and shalkan will wait while vestakia and the knights lead the children back to sentarshadeen. jermayan wants to run in but kellen tells him to wait. idalia, barely awake, sends a bat with wild magic to get help. it reaches one of the last dragons ancaladar, who is happy that he has never found a bond with a wild mage or elf, because when a wild mage bonds with a dragon the person gets inhuman magical power. however, if the mage or elf dies then the dragon dies, which is why he is one of the last dragons. he has been in hiding because the endarkened want him to join them. he decides since he is a creature of light he must help the wild mage at least, perhaps to the point of bonding. he finds kellen and the two fight off the elf-goblin hybrids and save idalia. when he heals her, the wild magic does not ask for a price, which is curious. they all get out and ancaladar asks if he can go back to sentarshadden with them. they agree to let him. they meet up with vestakia and the others. back in armethalieh, the elf, hyandur, helps cilarnen escape and get outside the lands. on the way they see one of cilarnen friends dead by the outlaw hunt. cilarnen is in shock, first for what the city has done and second for travelling with an elf. hyandur and cilarnen reach merryville, where cilarnen is even more upset that he has to stay around centaurs. hyandur leaves the next morning, abandoning cilarnen in merryville to go back to the elves. cilarnen now has to work and live with the centaurs and is not happy about it. the group safely makes it back to sentarshadeen. after they arrive ancaladar wants to bond with jermayan, making him the first elf mage in thousands of years. jermayan at first want to decline, but then accepts. the elves decide to get their army and allies to attack the shadow elves. kellen is upset with this. he thinks the demons are using the shadow elves as a distraction because if they really wanted the children they could have caught them after the heroes rescued them. the elves say that they can't leave this threat in their land. the elves decide to try moving the children to their fortress of crowed horns again. this time kellen goes with them, while jermayan and ancaladar fly them. they reach the fortress safely. kellen thinks it is great, but it has a weakness the elves do not think of: underground. he notifies master tyrvin, who is the leader of the fortress. they go back to sentrashadeen and they must all go to the city of ondoladeshiron to meet with the rest of the elven troupes and get ready to fight the shadow elves. kellen rides with the unicorn knights and finds friends with them. while kellen is there he meets atroist, another wild mage who lives in the wild lands near where the demons are. kellen wants him and the other wild mages of the wild lands (there are more wild mages there than any other place because that is were they are needed most) to come help. atroist does not want to leave the people because the demons would easily kill them. so kellen comes up with a plan. he wants the elves to allow safe passage for the wild folk through their lands since the folk can go into the wild woods where they will be safe. atroist agrees and says if the people are safe, all the wild mages will come and fight for them. they have to get permission first and petition the council. the council responds that they will debate it. while kellen is there he meets the leader of the army, general redhelwar. while the council debates, the elves go to war against the shadow elves. they go to their first shadow elf village, the place were they held the children. the elf army easily kills them with vestakia's help. the elves at first are hesitant to kill them, because they are part elf. kellen still thinks this is a distraction by the demons. back in merryville, cilarnen is adapting to his new life. he likes the people he lives with; gardner and his daughter sarlin. he still tells himself these are only centaurs, and someday he will return to armethalieh, though deep down he loves them and has become friends with them. one day an elf messenger comes and asks the centaur warriors to come to the elven lands and begin preparations for war as soon as possible. they accept, but no one tells cilarnen why they are going to war. before they go two wild mages arrive, a human male named wirance and the first ever centaur wildmage named kardus. since centaurs can't use magic, kardus' gift is knowledge. if he wants to know something he can have it answered, but there is a price like regular wild magic. cilarnen leaves early because he is scared of the wild mages and thinks that they are evil. as he leaves he meets a man who thinks he is kellen. the man turns into a demon and tries to attack cilarnen. cilarnen brings his magic up and blocks the attack. he is shocked that he still has his magic. the demon flies off and heads to the town to attack civilians. wirance can't stop it and the centaur warriors can't hurt it. cilarnen returns to see half of the village dead and uses his high magic to fight and kill the demon. the wild mages are in shock and can't believe simple high magic defeated it while their wild magic did nothing. as they mourn the lost ones including gardner, the wild mages want him to come with them and to tell kellen about what he did. he agrees and while he leaves, sarlin kisses him and tells him to come back. demon queen savilla is very angry, wondering why a demon attacked a worthless center village without her approval, and how he died and what killed him. kardus and wirance take cilarnen to elven lands so he can tell kellen about this. kellen is promoted for his success in the first battle and now has people at his command, but gives up shalkan. vestakia rides ancaladar and finds the next shadow elf village. near the elf city of ysterialpoerin is a bigger cave system that has two entrances. it is the oldest elf city and the most closest on how elves used to live before the war with the demons. while the army travels to attack them, kellen once again shows how amazing his knight-mage skills are. once they get to ysterialpoerin some shadow elves and wargs kill the scouts and come and attack the army. kellen realizes that they mean to go around the army and burn ysterialpoerin, so he takes his men to go and stop them before they destroy the city and finds that the shadow elves have a new fire that can not stop burning by any means. when kellen gets back and meets with redhelwar, all the commanders have a meeting on what to do. redhelwar divides the army into thirds, one to protect ysterialperin and two for each cave entrance. kellen wants him and idalia to scout ahead under idalia's invisibility cloak and draw a map to locate the shadow elf villages. one of the commanders, belepheriel, gets in an argument with kellen because kellen is doing things differently than how elves in the past have done them. kellen gets so angry he challenges him to a duel but belepheriel declines and walks out. redhelwar does not want kellen and idalia to go because he does not want to risk them. kellen decides to go any way. while he sneaks off, shalkan, the unicorn knights, and the elves under his command all catch him and want to help. they go get idalia and help him get out of the camp. kellen and idalia go inside the caves and find booby traps that would kill hundreds of elves. once kellen gets to the end several goblins come out of hiding and attack. after the fight, kellen finds idalia is missing. while searching for her, kellen realizes that if large groups of people head into the shadow elf village the whole cave would collapse, killing more than half of the army. kellen finds idalia heading in the opposite way in a trance finding a duergar, who draws any one in except knight-mages. some crystal spiders stop idalia from going to it while kellen quickly kills it. the crystal spiders tell idalia that all the shadow elves have left and there are traps everywhere, but so are the goblins and duergars. the crystal spiders hate the shadow elves because they hunt their kind. the crystal spiders ask idalia if they could wait one day before the army comes in. idalia agrees and goes to inspect kellen and notices that a goblin has poisoned him. she quickly heals him. when they get out they find the elf army ready to go in, but shalkan said he would kill any one that goes in. kellen tells redhelwar about the crystal spiders, traps, and how the shadow elves are gone. redhelwar is happy kellen saved him from this mistake, even knowing he disobeyed orders. the other cavern they are now going in has to be emptied out, but instead of risking getting caught in traps they try to lure the shadow elves out. they have do have army in thirds. one is at ysterialpoerin, one is outside the cave and one is hiding atop of cave to trap the shadow elves. one wild mage sacrifices his life to get the shadow elves to come out. the shadow elf army comes and attacks the elf army. jermayan closes one cave to keep them out and the top army traps them. however there are death wings and wargs with them, along with more warriors than the elves thought. when some shadow elves slip past the elven army, kellen quickly goes after them. all the shadow elves are dead but for the ones that slipped past the army. now the army goes in the caves to kill the women and children shadow elves while the unicorn knights defend ysterialpoerin. while they are in the caves they find only the children. the rest of the shadow elves have a secret exit were the women fled with the males to ysterialpoerin. when they get there they kill many unicorns and their knights including the leader petariel while his unicorn gesade is very badly injured. the shadow elves start to set the city on fire. jermayan and ancaldar get kellen and race towards the city to stop the fire. while kellen finds shalkan, he tells him he has to heal gesade because he is the only virgin wild mage around. kellen cures her but finds she has no eyes. he blames himself but shalkan says it was the shadow elf and he could do nothing about it. meanwhile cilarnen has reached elven lands and is battling the harsh winter. the elves tell kellen that cilarnen is coming. kellen is then so upset that his armethalieh life is coming back he can barely think straight, and is drawn to tears because he hates and loves the city, as he hates and loves his father. kellen then realize that the price for healing gesade is to forgive cilarnen. he has nothing personal against cilarnen, he just hates the mages. when cilarnen and kellen first meet, cilarnen tells him everything that happened to him. kellen shows him around camp. cilarnen meets redhelwar there and tells him everything. idalia, jermayan, and redhelwar find the news terrible because if the demons take control of the city they would have unlimited power to draw on. redhelwar asks the wild mages to see inside the city. all the wild mages get together and make a mirror that will link up to see inside. they ask for two thirds of the army to help with the price because it is powerful. in armethalieh, anigerel is making new wards to help protect the city. kellen and cilarnen will watch over how the wild mages do the spell. they see anigerel, everything he did, and how he is a spy for the demons. queen savilla senses they are tampering with her servant and tries to go through the mirror to kill idalia. but cilarnen makes a magic shield along with jermayan and kellen. with shalkan giving kellen power and ancaladar giving jeryman and cilarenne power, they save her life. when it's over savilla is close to death when prince zyperis walks in. the whole army can barely move with tiredness, with kellen, jermayan, cilarnen, shalkan, and andcladar all passed out. they however know that anigerel is the spy and they know what the plan is. the demons do not want to fight in this war yet. they want armethalieh to go to war with the elves and their allies. the demons will kill the winner. ||| 2 ||| 2
six million years after the first human is born on the plains of africa, dave lister - the last surviving human in the universe - wakes in a transport ship taking him to prison colony cyberia, the worst place in the universe, having been found guilty of serious crimes against the gelf state and sentenced to the worst imprisonment imaginable, having been hindered by his inability to comprehend the over-complicated legal system of the gelf - and his choice of clothing, including a tie depicting a naked woman in birthing stirrups. after his welcome by the foul and grotesque snugiraffe, the prison commandant, he is implanted and introduced into the cyber network of cyberia where he will be forced to live out his life in a hellish dream world of his own creation. naturally he spends a great deal of time considering where it all went wrong... dave lister awakes out of deep sleep on the transport ship starbug, disoriented and confused. the mechanoid kryten welcomes him back; he has been in stasis for twenty years and, not unnaturally, is suffering a spot of amnesia. he meets the rest of the crew, kristine kochanski, the cat, and rimmer. kochanski is so happy to see him that she takes him straight to her quarters to make love. despite still having no memory of her, lister is caught up in the moment and happily obliges. rimmer, meanwhile, has been able to procure a solidgram body from a derelict ship for himself allowing him to touch, eat and be three-dimensional again. rimmer enjoys the new feelings, and spends hours looking at his restored body in a mirror. on their way through the 'omni-zone' - the pathway between the seven parallel realities - back to their home ship red dwarf, the crew are surprised to come across a derelict space craft that is the exact duplicate of starbug. searching the ship, the crew find the duplicate cat's disembodied head, kryten's murdered body with his hand missing and rimmer's destroyed light bee. they then find the duplicate kochanski who has been viciously attacked and is barely alive. she makes lister promise to find his duplicate self before she succumbs to her terrible injuries. the crew soon find themselves on a gelf populated planet where the duplicate lister was likely to have headed. arriving, the crew find that the gelf tribe are sterile and sperm is a highly valued commodity. of course, lister and cat have a 'secret store' and the crew start trading for much needed supplies. meanwhile, kryten finds himself in the middle of a huge protest asking the magistrate what happened to the duplicate lister after learning he was arrested here. the magistrate explains that the duplicate lister destroyed property and murdered several people including the magistrate. kryten is confused, as the magistrate is clearly not dead only to learn that mystics predict crimes and the persons involved are arrested before they happen. kryten suddenly understands what the protest is about and tells the others. now knowing the duplicate lister has committed no crime, lister resolves to find him. the crew are sent to another gelf tribe, the kinatawowi, to get equipment they need in order to break the duplicate lister out of cyberia. unfortunately, the kinatawowi aren't sterile which causes offence when lister and cat offer their sperm as payment. eventually, a deal is made; the crew will get a bunch of ramshackle droids and a virus that destroys electricity in return for lister marrying the chief's daughter. unfortunately, the bride wants to consummate the union immediately and the crew quickly make a run for it while the gelf promise revenge. on cyberia, the attempt to break the duplicate lister out begins. although it is mostly successful, the virus causes the prison's artificial gravity to fail. lister is caught in the floating lake water and drowns, only to be revived by his duplicate self. the two begin their escape from the prison's forces however something doesn't sit right with lister. his duplicate, after retrieving his belongings, enjoys the fight to an alarming degree and when the two make their getaway in a vehicle the duplicate turns around when he learns that they will outrun them in order to get in some more killing making lister realise the whole venture has been misguided. later, as the two listers sit around a campfire, the duplicate pulls out the hand of the duplicate kryten holding a piece of paper from his belongings. lister realises with horror that the duplicate lister killed the rest of his crew and manages to knock him out and bind him with rope. however, as starbug approaches the evil lister throws himself into the campfire to escape his bonds and attacks. soon, starbug has left with the wrong lister while the other is left buried on the planet. an earth long ago, in a universe far away. the earth world president, john milhous nixon has learned that thermonuclear tests conducted too close to the surface of the sun have fatally weakened the star's structure, thus causing an eventual decay that will see the entire solar system die in four hundred thousand years - which will be very bad for the economy, and nixon's re-election prospects. the only hope is to move the human race to another world in another galaxy; and to that end, a genome has been created that will rewrite dna and thus turn an inhospitable, barren world into a world where the human race can live. a mission has been organised by dr. michael longman (and his clones, dr. longman and dr. longman), including numerous gelfs to assist in the process and michael mcgruder, a heroic star soldier who has accepted this mission in the hopes that he may be able to find and contact his father, the long-lost hero of an ill-fated mining ship, revived to be that ship's hologram... arnold j. rimmer. the real lister, having been rescued from his makeshift grave, is trapped in cyberia charged with orchestrating the break-out (it is made clear that it was in fact he, and not the alternate lister, who was the subject of the "cyberia" section and the flash-forward in "time fork"). having survived his alternate self's assault and attempted murder, he is now trapped in a soul-destroying hell of his own creation, where all the places and people remind him not only of the worst places in his life, but of everything he's lost, stolen by his alternative self - his girlfriend, his ship, his life. after five months of this hell, trapped in a grungy dystopian city surrounded by prostitutes that look like kochanski, soul-sapping advertisements about his parentless upbringing, endless showings of chitty chitty bang bang at the cinema and - perhaps worst of all - encyclopedia salesmen, he is brought out of cyberia and given an offer; to be part of an experimental terraforming and recolonisation program. the inmates bodies will be used to terraform an inhospitable planet into a comfortable environment. all of the inmates on cyberia are innocent, as only people without any malice or rage are able to be used for this hence people being wrongly arrested on the gelf colony (not knowing that the alternate lister was actually guilty of murder when he was incarcerated there as they were charging him on smuggling cases where they knew he was innocent). unable to stand being imprisoned in his personal hell, lister agrees. meanwhile, the crew of starbug have found that the piece of paper in the duplicate kryten's hand contained coordinates to a ship where important scientific research has been conducted. as it is a long trip to the ship, the mayflower, the crew are placed into stasis for the journey. kryten awakes early, in order to prepare the crew, and notices several disconcerting differences in lister’s medical records. they’ve got the wrong lister. and to make matters worse, in his checking of the alternate starbug's crew records, a cursory examination of the alternative lister’s file reveals that, following a traumatic and abusive upbringing at the hands of his manic-depressive foster mother (as opposed to the kinder, but poorer, foster parents of the proper lister) had developed into a ruthless, sociopathic criminal. before he can digest the alarming news, kryten is startled by the evil lister who has also awoken early. just as he attempts to take out kryten, a gelf ship sent by lister's bride attacks. boarding, the gelf demand what is theirs and the evil lister tells kryten to just give them what they want, something which kryten is more than happy to do. the evil lister realises too late that this means him, and he is dragged out of the airlock. as kryten muses on this lucky turn of events he realises that starbug is on fire. the rest of the crew wake just as starbug plunges into the lava bed of the planet they were heading for. before starbug can burn up, it then ends up in an ocean created by the mayflower. with starbug damaged, the crew board the mayflower and find several hundred vials of diverse viruses including positive ones that bestow luck on the infected for a time. kochanski, after infecting herself for a short while, manages to find more luck virus as well as other vials that will come in handy. kryten, meanwhile, finds a dna machine and turns himself human. as part of his agreement in volunteering for the terraforming program, lister is granted the use of a symbi-morph named reketrebn to fulfil his desires with her shapeshifting and telepathic abilities. reketrebn is defective, however, and intends to save herself for her boyfriend. lister isn't interested in using her for romantic purposes and asks her to turn into kryten so he can get information out of him before having her turn into him so she can feel the pain he feels from losing kochanski to his evil self. after this, reketrebn agrees to help lister. on the planet, lister meets michael mcgruder who was kept in deep sleep aboard the mayflower. mcgruder tells lister that he wants to meet his hero, rimmer, who is also his father. thinking he will never see rimmer again, lister doesn't correct him. he then learns of a powerful force known as 'the rage' created by the feelings of fury from the wrongly convicted inmates. to prevent it from killing everyone, the inmates form a circle and the rage will move between them before choosing one person to inhabit for a few seconds, killing them. lister joins the circle, and for the time he is consumed with the rage all his dark feelings are brought to the fore and lister begs it to consume him. however, it chooses another and kills him before leaving. kryten initially revels in his humanity, but quickly grows disenchanted with the experience and decides to turn back. doing so is easier said than done as longman, having used the dna machine too many times leaving him barely human, has stolen the mechanoid data. thanks to the luck virus, kochanski defeats longman and kryten is restored to his regular form. the crew then use the luck virus to find the coordinates of the planet where lister is and head there. reaching the planet, lister is reunited with the rest of the crew and mcgruder finally meets his father but is devastated when told he is hardly a hero but a maintenance technician. starbug loses power once it lands, and the planet will soon be passing through the omni-zone into another universe where it will be allowed to thrive. rimmer walks through a cave when he finds michael being attacked by the evil lister. his confusion about how the evil lister made it there despite being removed by the kinatowowi is put on hold, when suddenly the radiation gun the evil lister possesses drops close to him. however rimmer can't pluck up the courage to grab it, and the evil lister throws imprisons him in the hold aboard starbug with kryten, who found the dead bodies of the four kinatowowi who boarded earlier (the evil lister had never left the ship, having killed his escorts before going into hiding to heal from the wounds they inflicted on him). the evil lister emerges from the ship and locates the rest of the crew demanding the solar-powered escape pod to allow him to leave the planet. as well as this, he shoots lister in the genitals with the radiation gun rendering him sterile. meanwhile, the rage is approaching again. aboard starbug, kryten comes up with a plan to escape the ship using rimmer's light bee. although rimmer is hesitant due to the chance the bee could be destroyed, he talks himself round and agrees to take the risk. the gambit works, and the two escape the ship. the rage is near, however the crew come up with a plan to kill the rage by infecting it with the same virus that was used to break into cyberia. kryten plans to infect it by throwing himself into the rage, despite the fact that he won't come back. however the evil lister attacks again, but rimmer bravely comes forward to defend his shipmates wearing a jet-pack. mcgruder is proud to see his father acting with courage, and rimmer starts to enjoy himself feeling his neuroses slipping away. unfortunately, this comes to a premature end when the evil lister shoots rimmer's light bee causing rimmer to deactivate and the heavily damaged bee falls to the ground. the rage is nearly upon everyone, and there's no time left to infect it with the virus. everyone forms the circle required to prevent the rage from killing everyone, however lister warns that one of them will still die. the evil lister doesn't intend for it to be him, and infects himself with the luck virus. the rage hits, and everyone begs for it to possess them. however, thanks to the positive virus, the evil lister is the one who is 'lucky' enough to get his wish to have the rage consume him. he takes on the full force of the entity, which finally kills him leaving only his bones behind. even though the rage has passed, it must still be destroyed before the planet passes through the omni-zone. suddenly rimmer's light bee, hovering using the last of its power, uses morse code to communicate with the crew and offer to take the virus and infect the rage with it. after saying a final goodbye to his son, who now knows that while rimmer may not have been the hero he was raised to believe in he is still a man to be proud of, the light bee flies into the rage and infects it with the virus stopping its destruction and allowing the souls of the inmates who created it to rest in peace. the planet starts to pass through the omni-zone, and the remaining crew take shelter in the caves for three weeks as the planet is pounded by storms. emerging, everyone finds a pleasant, hospitable world growing, waiting for them. as kryten, cat, mcgruder and reketrebn leave to search for rimmer's light bee in order to give him a funeral, lister and kochanski stare over the world. lister sadly comments that this would be the ideal place to raise a family and help to restart the human race – a dream now impossible thanks to his alternate self. kochanski tells him that all hope shouldn't be lost, as he could still father children if he's very lucky... and kochanski still has some of the luck virus. taking it, lister and kochanski head into the grass and get to work. ||| 5 ||| 2
the first chapter introduces nicholas 'nick' simple and his older brother, herbert simple, who goes by the pseudonym 'tim diamond'. they live in a flat above a supermarket in fulham, and are down on their luck, with hopeless herbert not being able to get a suitable job. the first chapter also introduces johnny naples, a vertically-challenged south american who comes to the office carrying a suspicious package, and acting as if he is being trailed. he tries to explain the situation, whilst herbert tries (and miserably fails) to put on a hardman act. when naples offers them £300 just to look after the package, 200 now and 100 if the package is safe on the day he returns, herbert accepts - but from the very start, nick is dubious. the next day - after going to the cinema to see 101 dalmatians - they find their flat turned over by someone during the day. luckily, nick took the envelope with him. after a sleepless night repairing their apartment, they check the mail to find a note left by 'the fat man'. the fat man, herbert says, is the biggest criminal in england, involved in almost any crime there is - armed robbery, arson, theft and armed burglary are some of the things herbert lists. the note demands that the diamonds meet him in trafalgar square it turns out that the pseudonym fat man is rather inappropriate - when the man himself is finally revealed, he is one of the thinnest men nick has ever seen, with the rings on his fingers slipping off almost constantly. he says his doctor told him to lose weight, so over the past year he has eaten yoghurt and lost 135&nbsp;kg. almost pleasant conversation elapses into threats when nick tells the fat man that they do not have the box. however herbert trying to fool the fat man causes him to realise the package hasn't been stolen. the fat man then gives nick and herbert two days to find the box. when they return home, they discover that what is in the package is nothing more than a box of maltesers - a very popular type of sweet in britain, with a crunchy centre coated in milk chocolate. dumbfounded as to why johnny naples would pay them nicely to look after a box of chocolates, they visit the (fictional) hotel splendide after a quick enquiry at a shop traced using a sign on the envelope, with the keeper saying that the owner of a hotel in portobello road mentioned to him that a dwarf was staying at his hotel. when they go to room 39 at hotel splendide however, they arrive at exactly the time that he is shot. nick rushes into the room just in time to see someone jumping out of the window to safety. naples opens his mouth and is able to say "the sun...", and then "the falcon...", before he dies. a plain-clothes police man, disguised as a drunk in the street, arrests them, and they are sent to ladbroke grove police station, where herbert's old boss, chief inspector snape, accompanied by his violent assistant boyle, arrives to question them. snape - who could not stand herbert during his service there - apparently forms a grudging respect for nick when he realises how smart he is for his age. when nick offers to tell snape everything the diamonds know in exchange for what the police know, snape begins to tell his story. the falcon that naples mentioned with his dying breath is the alias of the late henry von falkenberg, an english-german international criminal who had been living in la paz, bolivia, when the police last heard of him. snape describes him as a great criminal, being involved in all sorts of crimes all over the world (snape's various locations include russia, canada, holland and england). the falcon would only deal in one currency - uncut diamonds. snape and the police suspect that the falcon had stashes of uncut diamonds in many cities around the world, including london, which was the base of his operations. when the brothers inquire into how johnny naples fits into all of this, snape tells them that he was a quack doctor living in la paz, with a run-down practice in the city's backstreets. however, with the falcon, his luck changed. a month earlier, as he crossed the road to catch a plane to london from el alto airport, the falcon was mown down by a bus, and johnny naples was the doctor who rode back to the hospital with him, in the back of an ambulance. although the falcon died on his way to hospital, he seems to have passed on a secret to naples about a large stash of diamonds in london, with an estimated value of £3,500,000. with this knowledge, naples quit his job in bolivia soon after the falcon's death, and caught a flight to england. the police picked him up in passport control at heathrow, before losing him for a short while, until they found him at the hotel splendide in portobello road. the police were watching naples, because of various criminals that, they suspected, would also be interested in the diamonds, and would be tailing him so they could inquire about the diamonds. snape then begins to write up, on a blackboard, the number of people who might have had an interest in the diamonds: *the fat man: the number one criminal in england, the fat man had often done deals with the falcon, according to snape, and he probably knew where naples was staying before the police did. also, if the fat man had £3,500,000 he could probably become an international criminal himself, the next falcon. *beatrice von falkenberg: the falcon's dutch wife, beatrice von falkenberg was once the greatest actress in the netherlands. the falcon fell in love with her when he saw her in othello in the title role. but he never apparently told her where the diamonds were hidden. therefore, she would probably want to know. *william gott and eric himmell: gott and himmell were german, but they were educated at eton. it is largely implied that they murdered the p.e. instructor, the local vicar, and the deputy headmaster, who was found hung with his own school tie. they were the falcon's two lieutenants, and arrived in england the day after naples. *the professor aka quentin quisling: professor quentin quisling (his name is not mentioned until the chapter the professor) was once the falcon's technological whiz-kid, inventing various things for the falcon. however, a year previous to the book, he goes missing. according to snape, he could be dead. snape then tells herbert he is a suspect, mainly because they were found with naples dying, in his hotel room, just moments after a gunshot rang out - and herbert was holding the gun that had killed the dwarf. the chief inspector then demands why naples came to the simples in the first place. nick tells him that he'd been looking for protection of some sort. in the end, snape lets them go, but with a caution, saying he doesn't believe them and neither will anybody else. they head over to a fast food restaurant called grannys, as a publicity stunt only grannies are hired, where they chew the case over. herbert suggests sending nick to australia or to auntie maurie in slough, who has a semi-detached house, and a semi-detached hip, and often forces nick to give her round the clock nursing. however nick says he would feel safer with herbert, as the fat man could kidnap him. they then decide to find out where johnny went. after finding a matchbox from a nightclub called the casablanca club (a nod toward another one of humphrey bogart's movies), they decide to pay the club a visit. at home they find the club is open, but their cleaning lady betty charlady says no good will come of it. quickly, they find that naples must have been a regular there - a waiter mistakes nick for him, and offers him a bottle of free champagne, and a singer called lauren bacardi (a take-off of film noir star and bogart's wife lauren bacall) asks of johnny's well-being. however, just moments after the brothers feel they are getting somewhere, bacardi is snatched by two shady figures in a blue van. nick manages to step onto the back of the van, but as the van hits 60m/h (96&nbsp;km/h), he is thrown off and into a wall of cardboard boxes, perhaps he could have held on but he was half drunk. after getting a taxi during the night, herbert discovers the next day that the falcon's funeral is being held at brompton cemetery, nearby. most of the suspects that appeared on snape's chalkboard had arrived to 'grieve' for the falcon. nick spots the falcon's wife, who pretends to mourn for her loss. they encounter the fat man, who tells them their time is up. on the way home nick buys a box of maltesers as a decoy, at their flat they find the fat man's chauffeur lawrence dead. snape then arrests them, but nick is let out the next day, although he tells herbert not to reveal what naples gave them. nick is intrigued by beatrice's fake mourning and visits her after she calls him. the falcon's widow, beatrice von falkenberg, claims that she deserves the diamonds (she is really poor and has had to sell all her property except her mansion) and threatens nick with an alligator in order to make him promise to give her the maltesers. nick goes back to the hotel, where naples was staying, in order to investigate, while snape keeps herbert for interrogation. in the midst of finding some scientific words scrawled in rough english on some scraps of paper, a grenade is hurled into the room and the hotel is destroyed. nick escapes, narrowly avoiding an assassination attempt by the hotel's owner jack splendide, and discovers from him that it was the fat man who threw the grenade into the room, having paid the owner to call him if nick came back. nick leaves the hotel owner hanging over the flyover and leaves the hotel, not knowing what happened to him and not really caring. back in the flat the following day, nick is visited by the professor, one of snape's suspects, who offers nick half the falcon's money if he gives him the maltesers. nick gives him the fake packet and follows the professor halfway down the road, but then is intercepted and kidnapped by gott and himmell, the most dangerous criminals in pursuit of the maltesers. they threaten nick with death over some tea and ask him for the maltesers. nick sends them to victoria station where he has said he has left the maltesers in locker 180, but in reality he is just buying time, for gott and himmell have also kidnapped lauren bacardi, naples' girlfriend. they are both tied up and left in a locked room but lauren frees herself, revealing she was once an escapologist's assistant. nick and lauren almost escape gott and himmell's apartment after nick climbs through a window and unlocks the door to the room but just as they get out of the room they were locked up in, the assassins return. nick pushes a beethoven piano out the upper-story window with lauren's help onto the assassins' van, injuring them. nick and lauren then return to lauren's apartment where lauren reveals more about her life with naples and how he saw the truth in john lewis in the city. they both go to john lewis but meet gott and himmell, and they try to elude them and nick ends up in santa's grotto, but himmell shoots santa and nick escapes. nick and lauren return to the apartment and nick just realizes he has discovered the truth - the barcode on the maltesers opens up the falcon's bank account. nick arranges a meeting in brompton cemetery with the fat man, gott and himmell. gott and himmell arrive, bringing herbert, whom they have kidnapped. nick tells them the truth and the fat man and himmell shoot each other. gott tries to shoot the simples, but then is shot by the falcon's widow, beatrice, whom, it turns out, was the simples' housekeeper all along. she tries to shoot nick and herbert but in doing so the police arrive and arrest her. nick, herbert and snape open the falcon's bank account in his grave, and inside they find - nothing. it has turned out lauren has stolen the diamonds because she worked out the truth. but in one last gift she sends nick and herbert a malteser - a malteser with a diamond inside. nick realises it must be valuable and decides to do something useful with his christmas holiday, like going skiing, though tim breaks his leg before they get on the plane. ||| 0 ||| 0
cloud atlas consists of six nested stories that take the reader from the remote south pacific in the nineteenth century to a distant, post-apocalyptic future. each tale is revealed to be a story that is read (or observed) by the main character in the next. the first five stories are interrupted at a key moment. after the sixth story, the other five stories are returned to and closed, in reverse chronological order, and each ends with the main character reading or observing the chronologically next work in the chain. eventually, readers end where they started, with adam ewing in the nineteenth century south pacific. *the pacific journal of adam ewing. the first story begins in the chatham islands, a remote pacific ocean archipelago. adam ewing, a guileless american notary from san francisco during the california gold rush, awaits repairs to his ship. there, he learns about the enslavement of the peaceful moriori tribe by the warlike māori. he also befriends a doctor named henry goose, and catches the eye of a moriori slave, autua, who is being whipped. later, as the ship sails adam is diagnosed by dr goose as being ill and in need of his treatment. at the same time, he finds autua, who has joined the ship as a stowaway and asks him to help. adam, helps autua get a job on the ship, but is becoming increasingly ill despite dr goose's treatment. at this point the story suddenly breaks off in mid-sentence. *letters from zedelghem. the next story is set in zedelghem, near brugges, belgium, 1931. it is told in the form of letters from robert frobisher, a penniless young english musician, to his lover, rufus sixsmith, back in cambridge. frobisher finds work as an amanuensis to a composer, vyvyan ayrs, living in belgium. there he helps ayrs with his compositions, while also seducing ayrs' wife and daughter. at one point, frobisher briefly mentions reading a printed text of the pacific journal of adam ewing, and is annoyed that half the text is missing; he is amused that the author seems unaware that dr goose is poisoning him. *half-lives: the first luisa rey mystery. the third story is written in the style of a mystery novel, and is set in buenas yerbas, california, in 1975. luisa rey, a young journalist, investigates reports that a new nuclear power plant is unsafe. at one point, she encounters rufus sixsmith, the addressee of the letters in the previous story, in an elevator. sixsmith, now an elderly scientist, hints that the nuclear power plant on swannekke island in unsafe. shortly after, he is murdered, and luisa learns that that the businessmen in charge of the plant are conspiring to cover up the dangers and are assassinating potential whistleblowers. from sixsmith's hotel room, luisa manages to get hold of a copy of the report on the plant's safety issues; she also picks up an envelope containing some of frobisher's letters and reads them. but the hired assassin follows her and pushes her car off a bridge, at which point the story breaks off. *the ghastly ordeal of timothy cavendish. the fourth story is comic in tone, and set in britain in the present day. timothy cavendish, a 65-year-old vanity press publisher, flees the brothers of his gangster client. his brother, exasperated by timothy's endless pleas for financial aid, books him into a remote hotel, which in fact turns out to be a nursing home from which timothy cannot escape. in the course of his adventures, timothy briefly mentions that he is reading a manuscript from a prospective author entitled half-lives: the first luisa rey mystery, which he is not impressed by. *an orison of sonmi~451. the fifth story is set in nea so copros, a dystopian futuristic state that is gradually revealed to be in korea and to be a totalitarian state that has evolved from corporate culture. it is told in the form of an interview between sonmi~451 and an 'archivist', who is recording her story. sonmi~451 is a genetically-engineered fabricant (clone), who is one of many fabricants grown to work at a fast-food restaurant called papa song's. fabricants, it is revealed, are treated as slave labor by 'pureblood' society. sonmi encounters figures from a rebel underground who draw her out of the cloistered fabricant world, and reveal the realities of the abuse of fabricants in nea so copros. at one point, she briefly mentions seeing a group of purebloods watching an old movie entitled the ghastly ordeal of timothy cavendish. *sloosha's crossin' an' ev'rythin' after. the sixth story occupies the central position in the novel, and is the only one not to be interrupted. an old man, zachry tells a story from his youth. it is gradually revealed that he lives in a primitive post-apocalyptic society on the big island of hawaii. his people, the valley folk, are peaceful farmers, but are often raided by the kona tribe from the other side of the island. zachry's people worship a goddess called sonmi, and know that once there was an event called 'the fall', in which the civilized peoples of the earth - known as the 'old uns' - collapsed, and the surviving humans have been reduced to primitivism. they have short lifespans due to a poisoned environment that causes disease and mutation. big island is occasionally visited and studied by a technologically sophisticated people known as the prescients who arrive in white boats. one prescient, a woman called meronym, comes to stay with the villagers, and gradually reveals that she needs a guide to take her to the top of mauna kea volcano, a place the villagers are afraid of because of the mysterious temples on its summit. zachry reluctantly guides her. it is revealed that the 'temples' are in fact the ruins of the mauna kea observatories. meronym shocks zachry by telling him that their god sonmi was in fact a human being, and shows him an 'orison' - an egg-shaped recording device that replays sonmi telling her story to the archivist. upon their return, the village is invaded by kona tribesmen who enslave the villagers. zachry and meronym escape, and she takes him to a safer island. the story ends with zachry's child recalling that his father told many unbelievable tales. the child admits that part of this one may be true because he has inherited zachry's copy of sonmi's orison, which he often watches, even though he doesn't speak her language. *an orison of sonmi~451. in the second part of the fifth story, sonmi learns the truth about nea so copros: that the fabricants are not released once they have served their time at work, but are killed and recycled into food and more fabricants. at the encouragement of the rebels, she writes an abolitionist declaration that tells the truth and calls for rebellion. she is then arrested, and finds herself telling her tale to the archivist. she then reveals that she knows everything that happened to her was in fact instigated by the government, to create an artificial hate figure in her that will encourage the oppression of fabricants by purebloods. but she believes her declaration will be inspirational. her last wish before being executed is to watch the film she remembers seeing, the ghastly ordeal of timothy cavendish. *the ghastly ordeal of timothy cavendish. in the second part of the fourth story, timothy cavendish and a band of plucky inmates escape from the nursing home. he sorts out his problems back in london. at the end of his story, he notes that the first luisa rey mystery turned out to be a good read after all, and he is inspired to write his own story as a screenplay. *half-lives: the first luisa rey mystery. in the second part of the third story, luisa rey escapes from the sinking car and by detective work successfully locates the report into the swanekke power plant, and exposes the corrupt corporate crooks. along the way, inspired by reading his letters, she orders robert frobisher's obscure cloud atlas sextet at a record store, and is perturbed to find that she recognizes it, even though it is a very rare piece. at the end of the story, she receives a letter from rufus sixsmith's niece, containing eight more letters from frobisher. *letters from zedelghem. in the second part of the second story, frobisher continues to pursue his affairs, while developing his own cloud atlas sextet. along the way, he discovers the second half of the pacific diaries of adam ewing propping up a table. he ultimately leaves vyvyan ayrs' employment and secludes himself to finish the sextet, before deciding to kill himself as he believes he has completed his best work. before shooting himself, he writes a last letter to sixsmith, and includes his sextet and ewing's pacific diaries. *the pacific diaries of adam ewing. in the second part of the first story, ewing visits the island of raiatea where he observes missionaries preaching to the indigenous peoples, whom they regard as savages. back on the ship, he falls further ill, realizing at the last minute that dr goose is poisoning him to steal his possessions. he is rescued by autua, and having been saved by a slave, resolves to devote his life to the abolitionist movement. when his father scoffs that human nature will never change and that ewing's life will amount to "no more than one drop in a limitless ocean", ewing responds "yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops?" ||| 2 ||| 6

the first part of the novel, the fabulous idiot, narrates the birth of the gestalt. in the beginning, we are introduced to the world of lone, referred to as the "idiot", a 25-year-old male with a telepathic ability who lives on the street. he knows he can make people do what he wants them to, but has never experienced real human connection. one day he encounters evelyn kew, an innocent woman who has been completely sheltered by her domineering father. she is the first person he has mentally and physically connected with. evelyn's father finds out about the relationship and kills evelyn and himself. during this incident lone barely escapes a beating from the father; bleeding and nearly dead, he is found and then adopted by the prodds, a poor farming couple, and lives with them for about seven years. when mrs. prodd becomes pregnant, the couple are about to ask lone to leave, but he makes his departure appear to be his own idea. lone builds a shelter in the forest and is soon joined by three runaway children: janie, an eight-year-old with a telekinetic gift, and the twins bonnie and beanie, who cannot speak but possess the ability to teleport. lone returns to the farm to find mrs. prodd has died after giving birth to a "mongoloid" baby. lone adopts the baby, who has a phenomenal mental capacity and thinks almost like a computer. together, lone, janie, the twins and baby form what will be later called the homo gestalt. prodd's old truck is always getting stuck in the mud, and when lone asks baby for a solution, baby helps lone build an anti-gravity generator. he installs it in prodd's truck, only to find that prodd has left for pennsylvania. the second part of the novel is baby is three, which occurs several years after the fabulous idiot. gerry thompson, a street urchin who has grown up in abusive institutions, is possibly sociopathic. he consults a psychiatrist, trying to piece his memory back together. gerry ran away from the institution and was taken in by lone. lone was killed in an accident and gerry subsequently became the leader of the gestalt. lone had instructed the kids to seek out evelyn's sister, alicia, after his death. they were educated and fed under her care. soon, however, gerry learned that domestication and normalization had weakened their gestalt. he killed alicia, and the group returned to living alone in the woods. if anything, gerry's telepathic abilities are stronger than lone's. his amnesia was caused by alicia's having accidentally transmitted her memories to his mind when they first met, triggered by her strong emotional reaction to hearing the words "baby is three". he learned about her entire life, including her past relationship with lone, in a split second. after being helped by the psychiatrist, gerry erases the man's memory of him. the third and concluding part of the novel is morality. again, it occurs several years after the previous part. lt. hip (hippocrates) barrows is a gifted engineer who worked for the us air force until the incident which led to his incarceration, first in an insane asylum, then in jail. janie, now an adult, befriends him and helps him regain his health. he slowly remembers what had happened. he discovered some odd effects on an anti-aircraft range. practice shells fired in a certain area were all duds. barrows does magnetic tests and finally discovers the anti-gravity machine, still on the rusted-out old truck on the nearby farm. gerry knows of hip's investigation and poses as a common soldier assisting hip, then launching the anti-grav into space and stopping hip from saving it. he then mentally attacks hip to make him look insane, driving him to a mental breakdown and amnesia, gerry does this because baby has told him that if the anti-grav was discovered, it would lead either to a terrible war or to the complete collapse of the world economy. gerry is determined to drive hip permanently insane. hip confronts gerry, and becomes the last part of the gestalt, its conscience. ||| 5 ||| 0
the people's republic of haven finds itself teetering at the edge of economic disaster. unable to maintain its massive welfare state in the face of inflation and deficit and with opposition to the government getting bolder, the leaders of the people's republic decide to resort to war against manticore. a short, victorious war, they believe, will both distract the proles from their current economic problems and allow them to use the riches of the manticore system to prop up their welfare state. meanwhile honor returns to duty after injuries she sustained in the honor of the queen to command the brand-new battlecruiser hms nike, the pride of the royal manticoran navy, with some of her old crew aboard and with her old academy friend michelle henke as executive officer. but on their way to her post, the engineers of the nike discover a flaw in one of her fusion reactors, which hampers her first operational deployment to the critical manticoran base at hancock station. honor spends the time her ship is in dock by beginning her first real romantic relationship with the senior officer of hancock station, captain junior grade paul tankersley. the havenites start the war honor had been struggling to prevent in the previous books. their plan is to launch probing missions on manticoran alliance members to push the alliance into re-deploying its forces to create weak points and allow them to strike at mantircore directly. they are aided greatly in this through the use of project argus, stealthy sensor platforms purchased from the solarian league and planted in alliance systems to watch the movements of manticore forces. havenite ships on ballistic courses with no active systems are able to collect the data dumps from the sensor platforms without being detected by manticore forces. when admiral sarnow's superior deploys most of hancock station's ships to other star systems to guard against further havenite provocation the argus net allows the havenites to see this weakness in the manticore position, and they decide to attack hancock station in force. honor joins admiral mark sarnow's fleet alongside her old enemy, pavel young. with most of the royal manticoran navy deployed elsewhere to prevent the havenite provocations, honor and admiral sarnow find themselves forced to defend hancock station from a vastly superior havenite armada. with the help of honor's unorthodox tactics, the task force is able to hold off the havenites for long enough for reinforcements to arrive. in the final stages of the battle pavel young's cowardice nearly costs honor her life when he disobeys orders and flees the defensive formation protecting the wounded nike. at the end of the novel young is removed from command, placed under arrest and is to be court-martialed at manticore. capt. tankersley is promoted to captain of the list and is to be re-assigned to nike as its chief engineer. this battle marks the first use of practical missile pods. the tactical situation faced by honor and admiral sarnow—having to defend themselves against a much larger force because their opponents have tricked the officer in overall command into taking most of his forces elsewhere—bears more than a little resemblance to the situation faced by admiral thomas c. kinkaid in the largest naval battle of the 20th century, the battle of leyte gulf. after the first disastrous battles of the war, three havenite revolutionaries—robert s. pierre, oscar saint-just, and cordelia ransom—lead the overthrow of their "legislaturalist" government by killing hereditary president harris and nearly his entire government during his birthday celebration with an air strike by shuttles of the havenite navy. they blame the killings on the navy, and using the fear of a possible military coup form a ¨committee of public safety¨ to rule the people's republic "until a new government can be formed". they begin a purge of senior military officers and political figures to cement their rule. this novel is much less honor-centered than the previous two, and the war is depicted from many perspectives. ||| 5 ||| 5

penrod jashber is more novelistic in form than the preceding books; rather than each chapter standing as a separate story, the bulk of this book has one story arc, of penrod’s pretending to be detective george b. jashber. otherwise it is similar: it is written in the same style and takes place at the same time. penrod jashber begins when penrod’s best friend sam williams acquires a new pup. the boys squabble about his name, the pup and penrod’s dog duke rampage through penrod’s house, and as punishment penrod’s parents force him to wear a smelly asafetida bag. penrod copes with this humiliation by telling tall tales of his exploits to his future girlfriend, lovely marjorie jones. the detective story arc begins when penrod further immerses himself in fantasy by penning a hilarious bandit epic starring george b. jashber, the "notted detective." penrod decides to become a detective; imitating his movie heroes, he squints his eyes and talks out of the side of his mouth. he paints an office sign in the (empty) stable and acquires an official-looking badge from the cook’s nephew. to practice, he shadows his school teacher in the evenings. now adequately experienced, penrod enlists sam and the two negro boys who live across the alley, herman and verman, as assistants. needing a scoundrel to shadow, penrod overhears his parents jocularly referring to the polished manners of a suitor of his late-teens sister margaret, a mr. herbert hamilton dade, as being appropriate to a horse thief. the rest of the book concerns the increasingly desperate but futile efforts of penrod and his gang to prove to themselves that mr. dade really does steal horses. their efforts are supported by sam’s older brother, robert, a rival for margaret’s affections; this support proves embarrassing when the boys’ harassment of mr. dade finally brings the children’s world of fantasy into fatal collision with the dull reality of the adult world. distressed by the exposure of his fantasy world, penrod discards the now alien persona of jashber and dissolves the agency, and he and the other boys return to their childish occupations. ||| 0 ||| 2

mainly feelings of intense anger (even more than is usual). christian is also approached by jesse zeklos to join a secret "club" he and ralf have started, though christian turns them down. rose becomes suspicious, and tries to learn more about this club, which she later learns is called "mână". although dimitri attempts to get rose and lissa into court to testify, it is ultimately adrian who gains them entry. on the plane ride to court, rose is struck with a horrible migraine, but shakes it off as they arrive at court; dimitri and alberta accompany rose, lissa, christian, eddie, and adrian. dimitri and rose go to visit victor in jail, who is as maddeningly pleasant as ever, and threatens to reveal what really happened between dimitri and rose the night he kidnapped lissa. dimitri threatens to have him killed in jail, but victor taunts them with his knowledge. the day of the trial, victor does reveal that rose and dimitri almost slept together, but everyone in the courtroom automatically believe this to be another one of victor's lies. he is sent to prison by the court. lissa meets with queen tatiana to discuss her future; she agrees to go to a college close to court, and voices her opinion on moroi fighting with dhamphirs. rose goes in to meet with tatiana next - who insists that rose stop sleeping with adrian and call off their "engagement". rose is stunned, and listens to tatiana call her everything but a whore. tatiana then reveals that she has been planning a marriage between adrian and lissa, and that they don't need to be carrying any of her "emotional baggage" around with them. rose shrugs off the queen's accusations and meets up with lissa, lying to her about her conversation with the queen. lissa takes rose for a manicure, where rose is treated by a young man, ambrose, who turns out to be a dhamphir and the queen's blood whore. he takes lissa and rose to a fortune teller, who gives rose a rather boring reading. dimitri finds them and agrees to have his fortune read. the fortune teller predicts that dimitri will "lose that which he treasures most". on the plane ride back to the academy, rose gets another horrible migraine, this time drawing the attention of alberta and dimitri. when they are forced to make an unscheduled stop at a human airport to refuel during a snow storm, rose's migraine becomes much worse, and when she steps off the plane, she sees the ghosts of lissa's parents and brother, along with many others. when she comes to, she is in the infirmary back at the academy. rose is finally forced to come clean about seeing mason's ghost, and she is ordered to see a counselor. her "guardian time" with christian is also limited. while back at school, her temper still increases, though she does successfully defeat dimitri as a "strigoi" while guarding christian. lissa is approached by jesse and ralf to join mână, and she accepts their invitation as a chance to spy on them, without rose's knowing. lissa is led into the woods and attacked by jesse and the other magic users. rose senses something is terribly wrong and runs to lissa's aid. she beats lissa's torturers – fellow students — and lissa tortures jesse using spirit. rose realizes that whenever lissa uses spirit, dark emotions fill lissa — which caused her to cut herself in the first book — and tells lissa to let the dark emotion flow through their connection and into rose - which is what has been causing rose's mood swings and violent behavior. lissa obeys, and rose suddenly begins beating jesse fiercely. alberta and dimitri appear, and alberta has several guards take jesse away, while ordering dimitri to handle rose, who is still in a manic state. dimitri takes rose to an old cabin that tasha ozera stayed in when she visited the academy. rose attempts to run to the infirmary, where she knows they would take jesse, but dimitri subdues her and forces her to let go of her anger. she collapses, terrified that she is going crazy. dimitri listens to rose's explanation and insists that he won't let rose go crazy. they end up kissing and rose loses her virginity to him and start to head back to the school when they are attacked by a strigoi. dimitri sends rose back to the school to warn the guardians, while he stays behind to hold off the strigoi. the guardians react quickly and send rose back to her dormitory, where she and the other novices are told to stay put. rose is sent to guard a small window, where she is finally given a silver stake. she senses immense fear from lissa, and learns that christian is in the church, where he was supposed to meet lissa to talk about jesse and mana. eddie and several other novices are guarding lissa and the other moroi, so rose sneaks out the small window to go after christian. she and christian rush to the elementary school, where there would be much less security, and combine rose's fighting skills and strigoi sense with christian's fire magic to destroy many strigoi. after the battle, rose learns that this is one of the biggest groups of strigoi - who are typically loners - to ever attack any moroi or dhamphirs. along with many dead guardians and moroi, several dhamphirs and moroi were captured by the retreating strigoi — including eddie. rose's mother, janine, comes to the aid of the guardians with reinforcements, and with mason's help, rose figures out where the strigoi are holding the hostages. before they leave, dimitri tells rose that he is going to ask to be placed with a different moroi close to court, so that he and rose can be together. janine, dimitri, and rose plan a counterattack, and reluctantly enlist the help of other dhamphir novices and, surprisingly, several moroi teachers to harness their power as a weapon. when the army reaches the caves the strigoi are hiding in, rose is forced to stay outside while janine and dimitri lead the attack inside. once all the hostages are out, rose goes into the caves to assist the retreat. just as she thinks everyone she loves is safe, dimitri is attacked and left behind as janine forces rose out of the caves. rose later finds out that dimitri's body wasn't found. another team of guardians returns to the caves the next day, confirming that dimitri was not killed, but was made strigoi. rose realizes that the fortune teller's prediction came true: "you will lose what you value most so treasure it while you can" - not herself, as rose believed, but his soul. rose decides to leave the academy to go after dimitri and kill him. after she files the necessary papers, lissa meets her just before she leaves and reveals that she figured out rose was in love with dimitri. lissa begs rose to stay, even tries to use compulsion on her, but rose snaps and tells lissa that all her life she's been told that lissa comes first. rose says that she needs to do something for herself for once. rose asks adrian for money, which he willingly gives to her, and asks her if she will come back. rose says she will eventually, and tells adrian that she will give him a chance - go out with him - when she comes back. as she leaves the academy, rose says good bye to mason, then heads off to siberia, where she believes dimitri would go first; back to his hometown. ||| 7 ||| 2
dawkins dedicates the book to douglas adams and quotes the novelist: "isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?" the book contains ten chapters. the first few chapters make a case that there is almost certainly no god, while the rest discuss religion and morality. dawkins writes that the god delusion contains four "consciousness-raising" messages: # atheists can be happy, balanced, moral, and intellectually fulfilled. # natural selection and similar scientific theories are superior to a "god hypothesis"—the illusion of intelligent design—in explaining the living world and the cosmos. # children should not be labelled by their parents' religion. terms like "catholic child" or "muslim child" should make people cringe. # atheists should be proud, not apologetic, because atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind. since there are a number of different theistic ideas relating to the nature of god(s), dawkins defines the concept of god that he wishes to address early in the book. dawkins distinguishes between an abstract, impersonal god (such as found in pantheism, or as promoted by spinoza or einstein) from a personal god who is the creator of the universe, who is interested in human affairs, and who should be worshipped. this latter type of god, the existence of which dawkins calls the "god hypothesis", becomes an important theme in the book. he maintains that the existence of such a god would have effects in the physical universe and – like any other hypothesis – can be tested and falsified. dawkins surveys briefly the main philosophical arguments in favour of god's existence. of the various philosophical proofs that he discusses, he singles out the argument from design for longer consideration. dawkins concludes that evolution by natural selection can explain apparent design in nature. he writes that one of the greatest challenges to the human intellect has been to explain "how the complex, improbable design in the universe arises", and suggests that there are two competing explanations: # a hypothesis involving a designer, that is, a complex being to account for the complexity that we see. # a hypothesis, with supporting theories, that explains how, from simple origins and principles, something more complex can emerge. this is the basic set-up of his argument against the existence of god, the ultimate boeing 747 gambit, where he argues that the first attempt is self-refuting, and the second approach is the way forward. at the end of chapter 4, why there almost certainly is no god, dawkins sums up his argument and states, "the temptation [to attribute the appearance of a design to actual design itself] is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer. the whole problem we started out with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability. it is obviously no solution to postulate something even more improbable". in addition, chapter 4 asserts that the alternative to the designer hypothesis is not chance, but natural selection. dawkins does not claim to disprove god with absolute certainty. instead, he suggests as a general principle that simpler explanations are preferable (see occam's razor), and that an omniscient and omnipotent god must be extremely complex. as such he argues that the theory of a universe without a god is preferable to the theory of a universe with a god. the second half of the book begins by exploring the roots of religion and seeking an explanation for its ubiquity across human cultures. dawkins advocates the "theory of religion as an accidental by-product – a misfiring of something useful" as for example the mind's employment of intentional stance. dawkins suggests that the theory of memes, and human susceptibility to religious memes in particular, can explain how religions might spread like "mind viruses" across societies. he then turns to the subject of morality, maintaining that we do not need religion to be good. instead, our morality has a darwinian explanation: altruistic genes, selected through the process of evolution, give people natural empathy. he asks, "would you commit murder, rape or robbery if you knew that no god existed?" he argues that very few people would answer "yes", undermining the claim that religion is needed to make us behave morally. in support of this view, he surveys the history of morality, arguing that there is a moral zeitgeist that continually evolves in society, generally progressing toward liberalism. as it progresses, this moral consensus influences how religious leaders interpret their holy writings. thus, dawkins states, morality does not originate from the bible, rather our moral progress informs what part of the bible christians accept and what they now dismiss. the god delusion is not just a defence of atheism, but also goes on the offensive against religion. dawkins sees religion as subverting science, fostering fanaticism, encouraging bigotry against homosexuals, and influencing society in other negative ways. he is most outraged about the teaching of religion in schools, which he considers to be an indoctrination process. he equates the religious teaching of children by parents and teachers in faith schools to a form of mental abuse. dawkins considers the labels "muslim child" or a "catholic child" equally misapplied as the descriptions "marxist child" or a "tory child", as he wonders how a young child can be considered developed enough to have such independent views on the cosmos and humanity's place within it. the book concludes with the question whether religion, despite its alleged problems, fills a "much needed gap", giving consolation and inspiration to people who need it. according to dawkins, these needs are much better filled by non-religious means such as philosophy and science. he suggests that an atheistic worldview is life-affirming in a way that religion, with its unsatisfying "answers" to life's mysteries, could never be. an appendix gives addresses for those "needing support in escaping religion". ||| 4 ||| 4
during a visit to europe, simon templar (alias "the saint") befriends a rich american whose son was recently murdered in new york city; the culprit went free due to police and courtroom corruption. templar is given an offer he can't refuse: $1 million if he goes to new york and deals out his unique brand of justice to evildoers in that city. the book begins with the new york police department receiving a letter of warning from scotland yard chief inspector claud eustace teal, indicating that templar, after being inactive for six months (presumably since the events of the saint goes on), has relocated to the united states. the letter is accompanied by a dossier on templar's career thus far (charteris proceeds to give new readers a brief summary of past adventures dating back to the first saint novel, 1928's meet - the tiger!). when an accused cop-killer is found shot to death, the nypd knows the saint has arrived in new york. after templar rescues a child who has been kidnapped by a mob boss (assassinating the gangster in the process), the whole city learns that the saint is on the job. templar's ultimate goal is to discover the identity of the city's main kingpin who is known only as "the big fellow". templar is abducted by one of the remaining crime lords and two corrupt, high-ranking new york city officials offer him $200,000 to reveal who is backing him. templar claims to be working on his own, and the crime lord orders templar to be taken for the proverbial "ride". templar is taken to a remote location in new jersey but manages to escape his fate thanks to the intervention of fay edwards, a beautiful young woman who happens to be a cold-blooded killer, and who claims to be working for the big fellow. simon templar and fay edwards fall in love with each other, in a completely platonic way (they exchange only two kisses and exchange only a few words) which seems nevertheless very deep and poignantly emotional. (on his return to london, in the last page of the book, templar would refuse to tell patricia holm about his american experiences.) the saint eventually learns that he is being manipulated into killing off certain crime bosses in order that the big fellow will not have to split a $17 million cache of blood money that was going to be shared among the gangsters. in effect, rather than being a daring and idealistic vigilante, as he thought of himself, templar finds that he had been made into a gangland hit man - and very much dislikes to see himself in such a role. and when the big fellow's identity is finally revealed, he ends up being the last person templar would suspect. *the book gives the first detailed physical description of templar, indicating that he is 31, six foot two, 175&nbsp;lbs, and has a bullet wound in his left shoulder. *templar's dossier contains some continuity errors. the novel appears to take place in 1934, yet the dossier indicates that meet - the tiger! takes place five years earlier, or in 1929, yet the earlier novel takes place in 1928 meaning templar has actually been active for six years at this point. similarly, templar should be 32 or 33 by the time of this novel, not 31 as he is clearly described as being 27 years of age in meet - the tiger!. however, in an introduction written for a 1963 reprint of the novel by fiction publishing corp., charteris suggests the book actually takes place in 1933, which sets the chronology correct (although it calls into question where in the templar literary chronology this adventure takes place). *if charteris' above claim that the book takes place in 1933 is correct, then the events of the novel must take place during december of that year, as several references are made to the 21st amendment (passed in december 1933) which repealed prohibition. *the book features a thuggish policeman named kestry. charteris had originally created kestry as the central figure of "the man who liked toys", a short story he had written for the american magazine. charteris later rewrote the story as a simon templar adventure (it was published in boodle) and for most readers, this was their first introduction to kestry. *burl barer, in his history of the saint identifies the saint in new york as the most violent of all saint stories, and notes that it marks the dividing line between the british-influenced stories dating back to 1928, and the more american-influenced adventures that would follow over the remainder of the series. *the saint in new york would be followed in later years by a series of the saint in...-themed novels, novellas and short story collections featuring templar's adventures as he travels around the world. examples include the saint in miami, the saint goes west, and the saint in europe. *years later, in a french saint novel, the saint battles a phantom, templar would refer to the aftermath of one of the characters in this story. http://www.lofficier.com/saint3.html ||| 6 ||| 2
* chapter one: close reading prose discusses the question of whether writing can be taught. she answers the question by suggesting that although writing workshops can be helpful, the best way to learn to write is to read. closely reading books, prose studied word choice and sentence construction. close reading helped her solve difficult obstacles in her own writing. * chapter two: words prose encourages the reader to slow down and read every word. she reminds the reader that words are the "raw material out of which literature is crafted." challenging the reader to stop at every word, she suggest the following question be asked: "what is the writer trying to convey with this word?" * chapter three: sentences prose discusses how "the well made sentence transcends time and genre." she believes the writer who is concerned about what constitutes a well-constructed sentence is on the right path. prose mentions the importance of mastering grammar and how it can improve the quality of a writer's sentence. in this chapter, she also discusses the use of long sentences, short sentences, and rhythm in prose. * chapter four: paragraphs prose discusses that, just as with sentence construction, the writer who is concerned about paragraph construction is stepping in the right direction. she states that the writer who reads widely will discover there are no general rules for building a well-constructed paragraph, but "only individual examples to help point [the writer] in a direction in which [the writer] might want to go." * chapter five: narration when determining point-of-view, prose says audience is an important factor. she gives examples from literature of point-of-view variations. first-person and third person are discussed, and even an example of writing fiction in second person is given. * chapter six: character using examples from the works of heinrich von kleist and jane austen, prose discusses how writers can develop characterization. she mentions that kleist, in his "the marquise of o—" ignores physical description of the characters, but instead "tells us just as much as we need to know about his characters, then releases them into the narrative that doesn't stop spinning until the last sentence . . ." excerpts from other pieces of literature are used to show how action, dialogue and even physical description can help develop characterization. * chapter seven: dialogue prose begins this chapter by dispelling the advice that writers should improve and clean up dialogue so it sounds less caustic than actual speech. she believes this idea on dialogue can be taken too far and that dialogue can be used to reveal not only the words on the surface, but the many motivations and emotions of the characters underneath the words. * chapter eight: details using examples from literature, prose explains how one or two important details can leave a more memorable impression on the reader than a barrage of description. * chapter nine: gestures prose argues that gestures performed by fictional characters should not be "physical clichés" but illuminations that move the narrative. * chapter ten: learning from chekhov prose gives examples of what she has learned from reading anton chekhov. as a creative writing teacher, she would disseminate advice to her students after reading their stories. as a fan of chekhov, she would read his short stories and find examples of how he would successfully break the "rules" of fiction writing, contradicting something she recently told her students to do in their writing projects. prose also discusses how chekhov teaches the writer to write without judgement; she tells how chekhov practiced not being the "judge of one's characters and their conversations but rather the unbiased observer." * chapter eleven: reading for courage prose discusses the fears writers may have: revealing too much of themselves in their writing; resisting the pressures that writers must write a certain way; determining whether or not the act of writing is worth it when one considers the state of the world. she concludes her book by stating that the writer may fear creating "weeds" instead of "roses." continuing the metaphor, she says reading is a way for the writer to see how other gardeners grow their roses. * books to be read immediately prose includes a list of book recommendations, many of which have selections from those that are used as examples for the concepts she discusses. ||| 4 ||| 4

the night of kadar tells the story of a crew of interplanetary colonists. on their approach to a distant planet, while these human space voyagers were still in a state of suspended animation, an alien life force enters the ship. it investigates and interferes with the minds of the sleeping humans, and also subtly disrupts some of the on-board systems. upon landing on the planet, the crew experiences confusion and disorientation. certain elements of the colonization party are missing, and there is no sign of their spacecraft. eventually one man, osman, reluctantly takes a position of leadership. he organizes the setup of the colony and the exploration of the world, although he has only a fragment of the manpower and equipment originally assigned to the mission. an interesting distinction of this novel is in the religion of the crew: they are moslems. although they start out as rather secular people, osman has them build a mosque, encouraging them to adhere to their religious principles. throughout the novel, a sense of lost heritage and memory continues to gnaw at the colonists, if only in a vague, unsettling way. by embracing their religion, they gain a measure of solace. although islam is a relatively minor aspect of kadar, it does make the novel stand out from the run-of-the-mill science fiction of the 1970s, anticipating by several decades the west's newfound interest in islam. as they build a settlement and begin a new life, the colonists meet a variety of native life forms. at first, the creatures seem harmless, almost comical. soon, however, some enormous, beetle-like creatures do pose a threat. the colonists also have occasional run-ins with a strange, glowing orb that appears and disappears without warning. eventually, after a series of travels and adventures, the colonists discover a tribe of fierce, brutish humans. these savages vastly outnumber osman's people, and eventually overwhelm them. at the end of the novel, osman and his men learn the awful truth: their assailants are actually the crew of the missing spacecraft. these unfortunates have lost all knowledge of modern technology, and know no better than to turn broken bits of equipment into primitive weapons for slaughter. in the end, the reader learns that all of the tribulations of osman and his people were machinations of an alien life force. the same being that had disrupted the minds of the crew in the first place has been operating the glowing orb as a kind of mobile, remote monitor. the orb serves to provide an entertaining spectacle to the formless alien that controls it from a location far from the planet where the action takes place. thus, the novel's conclusion might be considered a deus ex machina. all human striving turns out to be nothing but a puppet show for superior beings, our very existence absurd. ||| 5 ||| 5

the story of earthsearch 2 continues the adventures of the crew of the starship challenger (telson, sharna, darv and astra) begun in the previous serial, earthsearch, which told the story of theirquest for their lost ancestral homeplanet of earth (which had moved to orbit a new and unknown star when its citizens realised their original sun was going to go nova). at the end of the serial, the four crewmembers had chosen to settle on the sufficiently earth-like planet paradise and escape the ruthless, manipulative control of the challengers megalomaniacal control computers, angel one and angel two. while the angels departed paradise orbit to continue the earthsearch mission (and to achieve their aim of dominating an entire civilisation), the humans began their new life on their new homeworld. earthsearch 2 begins four years later, when telson, sharna, darv and astra have settled into their life on paradise (assisted by two androids, the agricultural machine george and the argumentative general-purpose service unit tidy). both couples now have young children - darv and astra have the twins elka and savin, and telson and sharna have their son bran. despite the colonists' embrace of paradise as home, the lifestyle is proving to be difficult and full of hardships. sharna's loss of what would have been her second child raises questions about the sustainability of the small colony as well as bringing up differences of opinion on how (and whether) to use the remaining technology and resources (including their surviving planetary shuttle). when savin is unexpectedly killed by a 'monster' that appears from the sea, the colonists are placed under further strain. noticing the appearance of an unidentified artefact in planetary orbit, telson and darv fly up towards it in the shuttle, to discover that it is an eight-mile long spaceship called voyager 30 and apparently part of an earth-originated survey mission. appearances are deceptive. the spaceship is in fact the returning challenger: repaired, shortened, refitted and still operated by the angels (as well by a team of control room androids overseen by android surgeon-general kraken). the angels are now being attacked by mysterious transmissions apparently aimed at damaging or destroying organic computers such as themselves and the challengers higher intelligence androids. as humans are totally unaffected by the attacks, the angels require human assistance in order to seek out and destroy the transmissions at source, and have therefore returned to paradise to recruit the only humans they can obtain. however, the angels do not reveal this information, and instead feign an interest in the welfare of the colony in an attempt to gain the trust of the humans. at the same time they have secretly sent an android to kidnap the children (the same "sea monster" which accidentally killed savin in a bungled abduction attempt). when rejected by the suspicious humans, the angels resort to sabotage on a planetary scale, using terraforming equipment from the challenger to melt paradise's polar ice caps and thus raise the sea level in an attempt to get their former crew to rejoin them on the ship. the resulting flooding begins to submerge all of the land, forcing the settlers to abandon their colony and use their shuttle as a floating ark, even down to loading breeding pairs of animals into the shuttle cargo bay. the crew survive and hold out against the angels' plans until a series of accidents loses them their drinking water, forcing a surrender. they make the best of things by demanding a concession in the shape of a reversal of the flood (so that the animals can be released and survive), following which they fly their shuttle up to the challenger. on board the challenger, the colonists make attempts to regain control over both the angels and the ships control room, but are thwarted when the angels kidnap the children from the shuttle. the adults are gassed by a surgical android and fall unconscious. when they come round, they discover that the ship has long left the paradise system and that they have been in suspended animation for sixteen years. however, the children have been awake the whole time, and have aged normally, now being between eighteen and nineteen years old and firmly under the influence of the angels. elka appears friendly and enthusiastic, but bran is now both hostile and the commander of the challenger. he demonstrates harsh suspicion and aggression towards his parents and the other two adults, even threatening to kill them should they challenge his authority. en route to the source system of the attacks, the challenger encounters a free-floating fifty-mile wide parabolic dish which the angels decide to use as raw material for shielding. telson, sharna, darv and astra are sent to investigate the dish. they discover that it is an abandoned artificial sun called solaria d, used by the earth during its transit to its new sun, and presided over by an angel-like control computer called solaria. despite her apparent benevolence, solaria is revealed to have been abandoned by earth once she developed murderous megalomaniacal tendencies. darv succeeds in destroying her. during their stay on solaria d, the crew discover the name (though not the location) of earth's new home star, novita six. returning to the challenger, the crew notice that solaria d is now moving in an anomalous way. they discover that the artificial sun is now in the grip of the gravity well of a black hole, and that the challenger is following it. attempts to escape from the black hole are hampered by the fact that the human crew have no access to the challengers control room, where android surgeon-general kraken has had his reasoning capacity damaged by the continuing attacks and is no longer responding to or obeying instructions. with the angels drastically weakened by the attacks and unable to assist, the humans attempt to storm the control room, which is defended by android warriors. the assault fails when the crew run out of time and the challenger is pulled into the black hole. the crew regain consciousness to find themselves on a gigantic plain surrounded by many different kinds of abandoned starships, including the challenger. they discover that they have in fact landed unharmed on an enormous artificial construct - a "gravity platform" which merely resembles a black hole and forms part of earth's long-range defences, acting as a trap for potentially hostile vessels. the chief engineer of spaceguard six, theros, refuses to release either the challenger or its crew as he deems the angels too much of a threat. not only have they integrated themselves into the entire structure of the ship (making their removal from it effectively impossible), theros suspects that they may have interposed themselves into the brains of the challengers crew. when darv locates the spaceguard's gravitational control room and reverses the field, he frees the challenger but at the cost of destroying spaceguard six. the ship continues its journey, but immediately runs into further problems when debris from the spaceguard seriously damages the ship's life support systems and farm galleries, threatening the lives of all humans and organic computers on the ship. with the inexperienced and insecure bran unable to cope (and undermined by elka, who secretly dominates him and dictates his actions at the prompting of the angels), telson regains command of the challenger and succeeds in organising the crew to deal with the problems. a second assault on the control room is more successful, but attracts the wrath of the near-invincible android surgeon-general kraken, who kidnaps darv and astra to replace his destroyed control room androids. now suffering catastrophic delusions about seizing the power of stars, kraken is placing the ship at drastic risk. with the assistance of their android tidy, the crew manage to destroy kraken and regain control of the ship. telson discovers that kraken has coincidentally selected novita six as the ship's next target star. arriving in the novita six system, the challenger finally reaches its original home, earth. however, the planet does not look like the earth that the crew have seen in recordings. it is almost totally dead, with very little water and no rain. the only sign of life is a huge ten-mile-high tower on the equator, with a tiny village nearby. the crew fly down to the village, and meet peeron, the leader. they discover that the earth's civilisation has collapsed a long time ago, and the human race is reduced to eking out a meagre living from a tiny spring that grows weaker every year. it appears that the humans will be extinct in a short period of time. the challenger crew use the terraforming systems on the challenger to bring rain to earth and create a stable weather pattern which will allow the people to flourish. the crew examine the tower, finding that there is a door set into one side which cannot be opened. peeron says that many of his predecessors have made attempts over the centuries - for example, by hitting the door with battering rams - but it will not budge. it is said that it is held shut by a "lock of knowledge". darv eventually works out how to open the ingeniously simple lock, which requires a low grade of technology which would only be available to people who have already worked out basic principles of science and engineering. the door is a very close/accurate fit in the aperture, and contains mild heating elements that cause it to expand and lock in place. these heaters do not heat it to the point that it is warm to the touch. simply attaching a refrigeration system to the door and cooling it a few degrees causes the door to shrink and move freely. when the crew open the door, they enter the tower, leaving peeron and his people outside. they discover that the tower contains a colossal library, presided over by the artificial intelligence "earthvoice" which serves as both the voice of the library and as a "guardian". earthvoice explains to the crew that the tower was constructed by the people of earth as a repository of all human knowledge when their last great civilisation was collapsing. the lock was designed so that the people could not enter until they had already worked out how to make some technology for themselves. unfortunately, earthvoice's abilities do not included weather control, so although he has successfully defended earth's legacy of knowledge he has been helpless to deal with the deterioration of the planet's environmental conditions. earthvoice has already communicated with the angels, presenting himself as friendly and subservient. prompted by elka to work with the angels, earthvoice re-establishes contact with them and is welcomed eagerly. he admits to having been the source of the attacks which have damaged the angels but states that they were a programming directive which he has now overridden. to the humans' horror, earthvoice and the angels agree to share both the library's knowledge and power over the earth, with the angels also urging that earthvoice exterminates the crew for safety. earthvoice begins to transfer the knowledge - however, the angels have fallen into a final trap. earthvoice has always intended to destroy them, and he now launches one last brutal and specialised attack on the angels from close range, erasing their consciousness and memory facilities. rather than interfere further with the primitive human culture on earth, the crew seal the door to the tower and return to the challenger. with the angels now reduced to subservient and "quite brainless" computer systems, they head back to their chosen home, paradise, to rebuild their colony. ||| 2 ||| 5
the boneless king captures shimmer, monkey, and indigo. they manage to escape and attempt to retrieve baldy's cauldron, in which thorn's soul is now sealed. however the boneless king turns the tables on them and traps them in an underground cavern beneath egg mountain where he was formerly imprisoned with the river poisoned and cavern sealed up. indigo figures out that water is the exclusion to the barrier spell as the river can flow in, so transformed into ice versions of themselves, they are able to escape. returning to the boneless king's tomb disguised as soldiers, they find that he has finished his excavation and left. the three catch up to where the pack train is camped for the night, but are unable to bluff their way past the pickets and are forced to transform into horses. they discover that some of the guardsmen and horses have been poisoned from drinking the river water and that the pack train is transporting the stone soldiers that were found in the boneless king's tomb. still disguised, they accompany the pack train on its journey. on the way, mysterious gases emitted by the statues follow the pack train, arousing such resentment and fear from the population such that "the countryside was almost ready to rise in rebellion" by the time they reach the capital, ramsgate. the pack train is nearly attacked by villagers at the capital's gates, but is saved by reinforcements. the statues are buried in a pit on the palace grounds. the three manage to follow the boneless king disguised as guardsmen to the harbor and onto the flagship of his war fleet, necessitating a change in disguise to being sailors. determining that thorn is in the captain's cabin, they manage to convince the boneless king's puppet wizard horn to let them in, but rouse his suspicions and that of his massive white dog snowgoose, who he had rescued from his island. unable to retrieve thorn in time, they transform into fleas and hide on snowgoose's collar. able to smell them but unable to determine where they are, snowgoose gets so upset that the boneless king loses patience with her and has her locked in a storeroom. they leave and return to the deck just as the fleet sets sail. pomfret arrives after the fleet is underway to relay intelligence of the dragon army gathered at the hundred children, an archipelago formed from an undersea mountain chain. he also recognizes that the strange, deep sea creatures that suddenly attack the fleet are illusions cast by dragon mages, resulting in the boneless king dispelling them. the fleet is confronted with a wall of fire as it nears the hundred children. as the boneless king attempts to disperse it, shimmer makes her move to rescue thorn, but she and monkey are captured. at that moment the dragon army advances towards the fleet despite counterattacks on the vanguard with a flammable liquid that can burn in water. as the boneless king prepares to use the cauldron to boil the ocean, shimmer and monkey escape and leap into the sea. along with indigo in dragon form, they are chased by pomfret and marines transformed into alligators. they are nearly captured while attempting to lose their pursuers within the caves of the hundred children which shimmer played in when she was younger, but by using the buoyancy properties of the needleweed juice that indigo has been carrying all this time, pomfret and the marines are rendered helpless as they are carried to the surface. as they make their way towards the dragon army which has been forced to retreat and given 24 hours to surrender, shimmer tries to convince indigo to seek safety on the mainland. however indigo adamantly refuses to go and vows to continue on with shimmer, as shimmer is “the only thing” she has ever loved given her rough existence, aided by monkey’s suggestion that she may have a role in carrying out civet’s prophecy. catching up with the dragon army, on the way to sambar’s palace they are met by badly injured members of shimmer’s clan, who insist on escorting her. at the palace, shimmer confronts her uncle, offering the dream pearl as temporary collateral for baldy’s cauldron and better treatment of the inland sea dragons, and asking for help in rescuing thorn. news is then received that the krakens have begun a large scale invasion, capturing the other forts and forges and forcing the inland sea dragons to flee. sambar has a change of heart and vows to fight alongside shimmer, who will direct the effort against the boneless king while he handles the krakens. indigo devises a plan to use the exotic creatures found in sambar's larder to terrify the humans, enabling to her to exact some payback on the kitchen staff who formerly mistreated her and earning the respect of the inland sea dragons who help her out. after shimmer's band of dragons is assembled, they receive intelligence on the boneless king's dispositions from a mage named bombax who spied on the humans in the form of a gull. it reveals that the boneless king has erected a series of prefabricated forts on the hundred children, and that he is at one of the forts with thorn and pomfret. after indigo observes that the defenses are oriented towards the east, shimmer decides to use the dream pearl to cast an illusion augmented by the grand mage storax's fog bank, while the other dragons hit the fleet from the west and monkey rescues thorn. when they are in position, shimmer casts a great illusion of a dragon army approaching from the east, but the dream pearl physically drains her and nearly claims her life. monkey is forced to destroy it to save her as storax and his fellow mages create a fog illusion to mask that of the fake army. monkey then infiltrates the fort where the boneless king is and impersonates pomfret, succeeding in getting the real pomfret attacked by a second flame bird that the boneless king had deployed. during its pursuit of pomfret, this flame bird sails among the warships gathered in the channel, setting them ablaze and crippling the fleet. monkey rescues thorn just as the dragons begin their attack. they infiltrate the forts disguised as humans and disposing of the living fire bombs and sinking the remaining ships. he returns to the battle after leaving thorn with shimmer and indigo, during which the unleashing of the exotic creatures of sambar's larder on the forts proves the last straw for their garrisons, resulting in their surrenders. after it is over however, it turns out that pomfret was able to steal thorn back disguised as monkey. shimmer, still exhausted from using the dream pearl, along with indigo and monkey set off in pursuit. they catch up to pomfret, who is transporting the boneless king, horn, and snowgoose. he flies into ramsgate, which has erupted in revolt, and is chased all the way to the palace. there, faced with a revolt of his own ministers, the boneless king openly declares himself for who he is, offering greater rewards to pomfret who throws his lot in with him. the boneless king then unleashes the stone statues from his tomb that were buried in the palace grounds, which suddenly brought to life, begin to attack his enemies. monkey uses clones of himself to distract them and get them to attack each other, just as the smith and snail woman arrive and lend their assistance. leaving them to deal with the statues, monkey, indigo and shimmer to chase after the boness king. inside the palace, they realize that thorn bears a striking resemblance to the last king before the butcher, emerald iii, making him the crown prince. they confront the boneless king in the throne room where they fall into an ambush, with shimmer and monkey getting bound with magical iron collars while indigo is turned into a bronze statue. the boneless king decides to send them all back to "before there was time...back to when nothing had form or shape", from which not even he himself could escape. while he casts the spell, pomfret tries to convince shimmer that he was right, based on the vision of him as the king of all the dragons that he as seen in the world mirror, which was found in the nameless one's tomb and reflects the possibilities that could have been and could be, but does not make predictions. with monkey's help, shimmer gets pomfret to see that if the boneless king rules the world, all possibilities are revealed to be a wasteland with no signs of life. as pomfret has a change of heart, the boneless king finishes summoning the portal to before time then turns on him and binds him. as he begins to have shimmer dragged into the portal, pomfret, realizing the magnitude of what he has done, with a final effort throws himself at the boneless king, carrying them both into the portal chased by snowgoose. the boneless king's spells are dissipated, freeing monkey and shimmer and restoring indigo. the news is broken to lord tower, the chancellor, that thorn the crown prince is trapped in the cauldron. the smith and the snail woman agree to help restore thorn, taking a sample of one of the boneless king's stone statues to study. the war between the dragons and humans over, shimmer and her companions are later accompanied by the inland sea dragons and many humans from ramsgate to river glen, where the inland sea waters are boiled away with the cauldron. they then travel to the site of the inland sea, where its waters are poured out from the cauldron and restored. the lord of the flowers arrives and restores ebony's tears, after which indigo decides to join shimmer's clan as she has lived among dragons for most of her life, being transformed into one by storax. the smith and the snail woman reappear with the news that they cannot fully restore thorn to his human form, but can attempt to turn him into some form which will keep him as both part-cauldron and immortal, to which thorn agrees, felt as a tingling when the cauldron is held. the lord of the flowers then reappears with monkey's master, the wizard known as the old boy, who reveals that he left thorn in the village of amity as an infant. after he helps the smith and the snail woman, thorn is brought back in human form, but makes creaking sounds when he bends his joints. he is convinced to and agrees to assume the throne. sambar later arrives following his victory over the krakens and bringing material aid and labor to help restore the inland sea. disappointed that thorn as the cauldron has been changed back, he accepts thorn's pledge of friendship between the dragons and the humans. monkey then departs the inland sea just before the arrival of the dragon king of the golden sea, from whom he had stolen his magical rod. ||| 2 ||| 2
following the end of changes, harry finds himself on a set of train tracks, where he is saved by carmichael. taken to a police station, harry encounters captain murphy, karrin’s father, who tells him he must return to earth and solve his murder, else those he loves will come to harm, or he can stay and work in murphy’s department. electing to return, harry travels to mortimer lindquist's house, which is under siege by wraiths, spirits who have given into despair and rage, led by a powerful spirit, who is aided by evil bob, the remnant of bob that harry ordered him to excise that contained kemmler’s knowledge and teachings. led by sir stuart, the mass of spirits that protect mort’s home drive the attackers away. reluctantly, mort agrees to help harry, and travels to murphy’s home. after being put through a battery of tests, molly, now a powerful illusionist and extremely disturbed, arrives and finally confirms harry’s identity, breaking down in tears. murphy explains that after harry destroyed the entire red court, the power vacuum it left allowed a group called the fomor to rise to power. murphy’s house is then attacked, and mort flees home. harry follows the attackers and finds they’re a group of teenagers who live in fear and under the protection of a practitioner named aristedes, who protects them from the creatures in chicago that have flocked to the city in harry’s absence. harry contacts one of them who’s sensitive to spirits, a youth named fitz, and convinces him to meet harry later. harry returns to mort to find his home destroyed and mort abducted. stuart passes on the last of his memories to dresden to use as a weapon and becomes a mindless specter like the other spirits guarding mort’s home. at his grave, harry exchanges the story of his duel with justin dumorne and he who walks behind with his godmother, the leanansidhe, in exchange for the answer to 3 questions, learning he was murdered by a male he is acquainted with. harry tracks down molly and finds that she operates under the pseudonym the ragged lady and is now under the tutelage of the leanansidhe, who uses brutal training methods to teach. molly is now an adept spellcaster and harry watches as she drives off a group of fomor, although he intervenes to aid his former apprentice. enlisting molly’s aid, harry tracks down mortimer, and finds him trapped by the corpsetaker, who is torturing mort with evil bob’s help to take his body. during this, father forthill, who elected to help the teenagers in aristedes' thrall, goes to reason with the practitioner and is captured. daniel carpenter and butters try to rescue him and nearly succeed but are overpowered. harry convinces the sensitive fitz to confront aristedes, and wrests control of the group from him, calling for aid for forthill and butters. harry enlists the alphas, karrin, butters, and molly to assault corpsetakers hideout, along with the army of spirits from mort’s home. harry storms the hideout through the nevernever, confronting evil bob, who overpowers harry and nearly destroys him before being caught and held by bob. harry breaks into the hideout and confronts corpsetaker, driving her away. however, while pursuing her he discovers corpsetaker had taken mort in order to have him summon the homicidal spirits from his home to her hideout. seeing the army of spirits harry summoned, mort is dismayed. the corpsetaker consumes the spirits, greatly increasing her power. with harry's friends in a sleep spell, the corpsetaker entered butters which leads to molly assaulting the spirit and casting her own spell which lets the corpsetaker enter her, dresden acts quickly grabbing the corpsetakers ankle and enters molly as well, leaving butters's physical body lying on the ground and his shade standing in disbelief and utter shock. inside molly’s mind, molly uses a memory to aid in her defense after being gradually overpowered, spawning a memory from when harry had a broken back lying in the church, she confronts harry with her feelings for him, as she will get to watch her entire family die of old age, and harry is the only one whom she can feasibly love. the memory assaults harry. during changes, realizing he must become the winter knight to save his daughter, and that mab would then turn him into a monster, harry contacted kincaid and asked him to kill dresden after the assault in south america, and then had molly remove the memory. realizing he ordered his own murder, uriel appears, congratulating dresden, explaining that, in a moment of despair, a fallen angel whispering seven words "and it was all your fault, harry" into dresden's ear. his direct influence allowed uriel to take active action as well, allowing harry to return, although he is shocked to learn captain murphy lied to dresden about his loved ones coming to harm. uriel offers dresden a choice to work for him or move on to what comes next. dresden asks to see how his loved ones fare, to make an informed choice. mort, taking control of the wraith swarm in corpsetaker’s lair in her absence, comes upon molly, who holds corpsetaker in place, and the tortured souls corpsetaker once held in thrall devour her spirit ending the battle. mort not being able to find harry standing around the aftermath finds murphy who is crushed by confirmation of his death, but mort surprises harry by being genuinely comforting and wishing he had been bright enough to have known this side of mort while he was alive, giving murphy one last look, turns and walks to uriel and asks to see his brother. thomas, who harry had not thought of since becoming a spirit realizes how he couldn't have thought of thomas without remembering the truth and shame of his own murder. destroyed and bitter over harry’s death, is elated when he realizes justine has devised a method by which she and thomas can be intimate once more. before asking uriel to show his next loved one, uriel understands and takes harry to see his daughter maggie, who has been adopted by the carpenters, who love her dearly, with the protection of mouse, whom harry embraces one last time. happy that michael is under the protection of a squad of angels, realizes those he loves are safe as they can be, harry elects to move on. he then awakens on demonreach, under the care of queen mab, who saved harry the moment he fell into the darkness of the lake, her own domain, and the island, which kept him alive. distrusting of harry, mab informs harry that she knew he would have tried to create a plan to end the contract of becoming the winter knight, and that it had backfired; she is simultaneously angry and approving about this, saying that his defiance and ingenuity are the traits she sought him out for. annoyed at uriel's influence, tells harry to prepare himself for her to turn him into her creature, and uriel uses his opportunity to balance out the actions of the fallen angel who corrupted his free will by whispering seven words to harry "lies, mab cannot change who you are". harry tells mab he won’t be her creature, enraging her, but tells her he will be her devoted knight, the greatest she has ever had, but that he shall do it his way, else mab can turn him into another mindless, and worthless, thug. mab, still enraged but also ecstatic, tells harry to prepare himself, and pulls them into the winter court. ||| 2 ||| 2
shedara, forlo, and hult, prepare to leave coldhope keep, but are attacked by shadow-fiends. the shadow-fiends outnumber them, and are losing as well as badly injured. luckily, eldako shows up and manages to kill the rest of the shadow-fiends. they decide to stay in coldhope keep until they recover. later, the fourth legion of the imperial league arrives, intent on arresting forlo for desertion. forlo claims he didn't desert, but they are still determined to arrest. eldako and shedara manage to escape via a magic levitation spell, by jumping down a cliff. however, hult is afraid of magic, so he didn't manage to escape. forlo didn't want the fourth legion to capture just hult, as they would torture him since they wouldn't get himself, so he stayed with hult and was arrested too. hult and forlo are taken back to the capital, kristophan, and since eldako and shedara can't overpower so many minotaurs, they travel back to armach-nesti to see if they can get help. at the same time, essana is in the jungles of neron, and held captive by the brethren who are trying to resurrect maladar. the faces of the brethren are scarred, and hidden behind hoods, just like maladar. they want to resurrect maladar because they believe that taladas is declining due to war, famine, etc., and that maladar will reestablish the empire of aurim, bringing peace and prosperity. there are six of the faceless brethren; the keeper, the master, the teacher, the slayer, the watcher, and the speaker. she later learns that the keeper is secretly a spy for the kings of the rainward isles. she is forced to watch them sacrifice elves of the jungle to maladar. meanwhile, the scenario in armach-nesti is even worse. thousands of shadow-fiends have invaded the woods, and the elves are hard-pressed to keep them back. the city has been overrun, and it's basically a melee. she discovers that her brother only has sixty elves total in his force, but he still manages to spare some to help rescue forlo and hult. since forlo "deserted", he's brought to rekhaz, who is now the emperor of the imperial league. rekhaz has no pity for forlo, and declares his life forfeit. forlo manages to call on his imperial right of dueling in the arena, and so he and hult are sent to fight a horax, and begin to lose soon after. shedara, eldako, and the elves of armach-nesti manage to sneak into kristophan, rescue forlo and hult, and escape. forlo kills rekhaz in cold blood on the streets of armach-nesti. the elves of armach-nesti gives hult a magical pendant of language, so that he can understand what other people are saying. now reunited, they head north to the snowy fields of panak, where they search for the wyrm-namer, a dragon that can name other dragons. they arrive in panak on a magical elven boat, and quickly meet the wolf-clan, a friendly clan that eldako has lived with before. on their way to the clan village, they are beset by a snow storm, and pursued by the eyes, which are almost invulnerable evil creatures that kill any that venture into the snow storms. however, they can be held at bay by statues of the patient folk. they arrive at the wolf-clan's village, and meet the seer, tulukaruk. tulukaruk lets a spirit-wolf take control of his body to communicate with them. they learn that the spirit-wolf will only tell them where and how to find the wyrm-namer only if they will agree to kill it when they're done. forced with no choice, they agree. angusuk, the lead hunter of the tribe leads them to the mountain of the wyrm-namer, where hult uses his magical pendant to communicate with the snow-ogres that guard his lair. they entire the namer's lair, and discover that he's dying. before he dies, he manages to tell them the name of the dragon, gloomwing, who lives in the valleys of marak, home of the kender. they head back to the village and discover that the shadow-fiends had massacred everyone there, and toppled the statues of the patient folk. they notice that some hunters may have escaped, so angusuk decides to stay and look for the rest of his tribe. shedara, hult, eldako, and forlo head for marak. essana and the keeper attempt to escape through a tunnel, and essana begins to miscarriage in the tunnel. they manage to exit the tunnel and get to the rendezvous point with the elves, although they are ambushed. essana faints, and when she wakes up she discovers that she is chained. the master shows her what happened to the keeper, he's mutilated, and is being kept alive by a magic spell. meanwhile, the four arrive in marak, and discover that gloomwing left, though the kender are nearing extinction because the shadow-fiends capture kender, and take them to the teacher, who arrives when the black moon is full to turn them into more shadow-fiends. luckily (or unluckily), the black moon was full that night, so they attempt to ambush the teacher. they capture him, and question him. after that, they desire revenge, so they kill him. after that, they sail to neron, and as soon as they arrive, gloomwing decides to "meet" them. the four notice that the elves were gathering in the woods preparing to ambush gloomwing, so eldako decides to be a "dummy" for gloomwing. gloomwing dives at eldako and breathes acid at him, and at the last second eldako falls into the water. the elves meanwhile kill gloomwing. they search for eldako until it is dark, and are forced to leave and head for the elven village because mind flayers patrol the woods after dark. they meet the oldest elf in the village, the grandmother. grandmother tells them that a prophecy foretold that two humans and two elves would destroy the brethren. she notices that they are missing eldako, so she scries for him. they find out that the mind flayers captured eldako, and that he was badly hurt by the dragon's acid. eldako's right eye was gone, and his vision in his left eye is cloudy. his skin was melted by the acid, and his right leg was the only part of him untouched by the acid. they rescue him, and they assault the temple of maladar. they manage to kill the brethren, and eldako manages to kill the master by jumping to his death with the master. they rescue essana and azar, essana's son, who is already eighteen due to age altering magic. however, instead of maladar taking over azar, he accidentally manages to take control of forlo, and he escapes to the burning sea where he will try to resurrect aurim. ||| 2 ||| 2
charles dalgleish forrester is revived from cryopreservation in the year 2527, having been killed in a fire 500 years earlier. thanks to his insurance, after the expenses of his revival are paid he has a quarter of a million dollars, a fortune in his eyes. he can afford the luxuries of 26th century life, such as a joymaker, a scepter-like portable computer terminal with some extra features like a drug dispenser. after a heavy night partying, with some distant memory of an argument with somebody, he wakes in his new apartment, and over a 20th century breakfast, checks in with his joymaker. the joymaker communicates by voice, and addresses him always as "man forrester". he is informed that he has a message from a woman whose name he doesn't recognize, and that someone called heinzlichen jura de syrtis major has taken out a hunting license on him. baffled, he eventually encounters the woman from the party who he believes is called tip. she maintains she is adne bensen, the woman whose messages he has been ignoring. apparently she got on so well with forrester that she is ready to begin a relationship. she takes him back to her apartment, where he finds she has two children, around 8 years old, who seem somewhat precocious for their years. with names like "tunt" and "mim" flying around, he mistakenly assumes those are the children's names, baffling them when he uses them that way. later forrester encounters heinzlichen with a few friends, who without much ado beat him up so badly he goes to the hospital. it transpires that heinzlichen's hunting license allows him to kill forrester providing he pays for the revival, and the whole vendetta is over some insult at the party, which forrester can barely remember. it's possible forrester trod on heinzlichen's foot. since heinzlichen is from the human colonies on mars and is adapted to low gravity, this is a major faux pas. mistake follows on mistake, compounding confusion. forrester comes to believe that adne is attempting to entrap him in fatherhood, presumably for his money, when she leaves a message saying that "we have to choose a name". he is equally disdainful of a friend who keeps asking him to join his club, expecting that also to be just a ruse to get at his money. eventually adne sets him straight. firstly, he'll be broke soon because, unbeknownst to him, all the 20th century foods he likes are very expensive, as are all the other joymaker functions he enjoys. he needs to get a high-paying job. secondly, the "name" she was asking about was a "reciprocal name," one used only between two close friends or intimates. each uses it only to address the other, as "tunt" was the children's name for each other, and "mim" was the name used between adne and the children. tip was the name she and another close friend used, so forrester could not use it. the friend wanting forrester to join his club was in fact offering him a paying position in the organization, though forrester is not sure he likes what the club stands for. however, forrester's woes are not over. he first takes a high-paying job for what turns out to be an alien life form. the alien is known to all as a sirian, but only because that's the star system in which he was captured (sirius). earth is in a state of preparation for a sirian attack it is expecting. when the alien ship was first encountered, the earth ship shot first and asked questions later. the only thing stopping an attack, it is believed, is that the sirian's home world population has no idea where earth is. the captured sirians live on earth in a state of virtual house arrest, with their movements restricted and monitored. forrester's job is to be the sirian's guide to earth culture and history, and is paid handsomely for it. unfortunately adne and the others shun him for working for the alien. the sirian asks many questions about seemingly arbitrary topics of human history. when forrester fails to respond to one of the sirian's requests in time, he is promptly fired by the sirian. he then takes a high-paying job which is an apparent sinecure, watching over some machinery, until he learns that all the previous holders of the post are in cryopreservation after being blasted with radiation. against the warnings of the joymaker, he quits in the middle of a shift. in this time, this is a huge error, and all his funds are taken in fines. he is reduced to nothing, and forced to live with all the other bums on skid row. the existence is actually quite comfortable. nobody can afford a joymaker, but rich people pass through doling out money to 26th century panhandlers, and there are cash-only eating places with coin-operated joymakers at the tables. however, there are also people looking for thrills on the cheap, wanting to kill someone without having to pay for the revival. after a near miss, he runs into the sirian again, who drugs and hypnotizes him. under the delusion that he is helping adne take a trip, forrester places the sirian in control of a spacecraft. the ship heads into space and escapes, but not before the whole world learns that the alien escaped, though not forrester's role in the affair. the entire human population goes into a panic. most commit suicide in order to hide in the cryopreservation banks. heinzlichen comes after forrester one more time, and forrester kills him. this was simply heinzlichen's way of getting into the freezer. eventually forrester is almost alone. at this point the club he had been asked to join goes into action. they are a 26th century version of luddites and are bent on dismantling the world's technological base by subverting central computing systems, believing this will improve human welfare. ominously, they are "helped" by the sirians in doing so. in the end, medical technicians and the luddites are the only people left awake. forrester learns about the conspiracy of the luddites. forrester cannot reach the technicians because all the computer terminals have been programmed against him. his only hope is to kill himself. he walks up to one of the automated medics, and cuts his throat. fortunately the medic, reacting to its programming to

anand is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in modern india. a believer in fairy tales and magic, he used to go to school until his family could no longer afford to pay for his lessons. his father had left two years before the start of the story. his sister, meera, on the other hand, had been hurt mentally when she witnessed a murder. thus, anand and his mother had been forced to work. anand has been employed by a tea shop owner, haru, who is frequently displeased with anand's work and pays very little. one day, the shop was visited by an old man, whom haru assumes to be a beggar. ordered to take the beggar out of haru's shop, anand gently guides the old man out and, feeling sympathetic, gives the old man his lunch of stale pooris and weak tea. later that night, anand find the old man at his door. the man, who introduces himself as abhaydatta, tells his story of a group of healers, known as the brotherhood, who wield magic in a place called the silver valley, hidden deep within the himalayas. he also reveals that a powerful magical item, the conch, has been stolen from the brotherhood by one of its members, surabhanu. this resulted in the weakening of the brotherhood, thus, they sent four pairs of healers to search for the conch. abhaydatta and his partner have, indeed, retrieved the conch, however, his partner died buying abhaydatta time to escape from surabhanu. abhaydatta asks anand for help in his journey back to the silver valley. he revealed that it is anand's belief in magic that drew abhaydatta and the conch to kolkata. sensing anand's hesitation, abhaydatta healed meera. however, anand's mother arrived and, finding no visible effect on meera, ordered abhaydatta out of the house, despite anand's protests. abhaydatta left, informing them where he will be and what time he will leave, with or without anand. the next morning, anand was awakened by meera's voice; she was cured during the night and was able to speak normally again. his mother gave her consent and let anand go. unfortunately, for anand, abhaydatta had already left. anand meets nisha, a girl sweeping in front of a soft drinks stall, who tells him she knows where abhaydatta will be waiting. after anand reluctantly agrees to let her come, she leads him to the train station. there, they ran into surabhanu, disguised as a wealthy passenger. he manages to hold the struggling children until a mysterious candy vendor helps them escape. outside the station, they meet a blind beggar woman who, after receiving alms from anand, points the two children in the direction of the meeting point where anand and nisha finally find abhaydatta. the healer was initially disapproving of nisha but relented, nonetheless. the three started on their journey towards the silver valley. along the way, abhaydatta told the children of the journey ahead and what to do if they get separated from him. he told of the dangers they will face and the three trials they will have to pass before reaching the silver valley. abhaydatta also secretly entrusted the conch to anand; surabhanu would not expect the healer to trust the conch to a boy. surabhanu, however, caught up to the three. in the duel that ensued, anand and nisha escaped but abhaydatta has mysteriously vanished. as they journeyed, anand began hearing the conch talk to him and respond to his thoughts. it reveals to anand that it will allow itself to be used only after all human solutions have been exhausted. a mongoose also joins the two children, saving them from trouble a few times along the way and earning nisha's appreciation. they finally reach the first trial of the brotherhood: a raging river none of them can cross. the mongoose, however, steps into the river, which stilled as the animal and the two children made their way across. upon reaching the second trial, an enchanted rocky pass, anand was forced to decide between going on alone or staying with nisha. a bit of ingenious thinking allowed both of them to cross the pass, however, nisha was injured badly. unfortunately, surabhanu caught up to the two children in the form of a red snake. he reveals that nisha had been under his control since their encounter at the train station. surabhanu orders her to smash anand's head with a rock but the mongoose, which had been abhaydatta all along, fought with surabhanu. the mongoose was defeated, which pained nisha and caused her to betray surabhanu. the conch finally allows anand to use it, defeating surabhanu in a wave of fire. anand arrives at the gate to the silver valley. there, in the final trial, he was made to choose between glory in the silver valley or his friends. giving up the conch, he chose to remain with an injured nisha and a mongoose abhaydatta. the brotherhood declares that he has passed the final test, the trial within his mind, and welcomes anand, nisha and abhaydatta into the silver valley. with the conch restored in the valley, abhaydatta was restored to his human form and, with some help from anand and nisha, his mind was also turned back from that of a mongoose into his old self. nisha was inducted as a novice, the first female member of the brotherhood, which made anand wonder why the brotherhood did not invite him to join them. abhaydatta talks to anand and reveals that, unlike anand, nisha has no family. thus, it was anand who had to choose between the brotherhood or his family which had just found anand's father and he was imprisoned for a crime he did not comit. anand chose to stay with the brotherhood so the healers made his family forget he had ever been a part of their lives. anand, however, was not allowed to forget them for, as a healer, he should remember the pain and what he had given up for the brotherhood. anand was then inducted not just as a novice but also as the titular conch bearer. ||| 2 ||| 2
the story is told in first person by michael "puppy" young, a young history student at cambridge university on the verge of completing his doctoral thesis on the early life of adolf hitler and his mother. he meets professor leo zuckerman, a physicist who has a strong personal interest in hitler, the rise of nazism and the holocaust. michael assumes this is due to his jewish heritage. however, it is later revealed that leo was born axel bauer, the son of dietrich bauer, a nazi doctor at auschwitz. leo has developed a machine that enables the past to be viewed&mdash;but it is of no practical use as the image is not resolvable into details. together, they hatch a plan to modify the machine such that it can be used to send something back into time. they decide to use a permanent male contraceptive pill, stolen from michael's girlfriend (a biochemistry researcher), who, due to his continual distraction, has left him to take a position at princeton university. they decide to send this pill back in time to the well in braunau am inn so that hitler's father will drink from it, become infertile, and hitler will never be born. when michael awakens he is completely disoriented. he soon discovers that he is in the usa, at princeton university. everyone he encounters is surprised that he is speaking with an english accent. it takes some time for michael's memory to return. he realizes that his plan was successful, history has changed, and for some reason his parents must have moved to america. initially he is elated and tells his new friend steve how happy he is because steve has never heard of hitler, braunau-am-inn, or the nazi party. steve corrects michael and reveals that he is well aware of the nazi party. michael begins to discover the history of this new world. it turns out that without hitler, a new leader emerged, rudolph gloder, who was equally ruthless. in fact, michael and zuckerman have replaced hitler with a nazi leader who was even more charming, patient, and effective, and as committed to the final solution as hitler had been. in this alternate timeline, the nazis won a mandate in the reichstag in 1932 and built up an electronics industry of their own. unlike hitler, gloder proceeded with stealth, ensuring peaceful unification with austria in 1937. more alarmingly, gloder's nazis also had a head start on the research and development of nuclear weapons, which led to the destruction of moscow and leningrad, eliminating joseph stalin and his politburo in this alternate 1938. the greater german reich annexes czechoslovakia, hungary, yugoslavia, poland, turkey and invades the remnants of the former soviet union. in 1939, france, britain, scandinavia, and the benelux nations capitulate, although britain rebels in 1941, leading to the execution of several dissidents, among them the duke of york (the historical king george vi). jews are exiled to a "jewish free state" within the former yugoslavia, where most of this world's holocaust occurs. the united states develops nuclear weapons in 1941, leading to a cold war between nazi germany, its satellites, and the united states. the latter has never gone to war against the japanese empire in the pacific, and it is left unsaid whether japan has its own nuclear weapons as well. due to these changes, the nazis are now the dominant power in the whole of europe. the plan for genocide of the jewish race came to fruition, although this is only implied, never explicitly stated. (every time michael attempts to ask someone what happened to europe's jews, he receives no answer.) the usa is engaged in a fierce struggle short of combat against the nazis, supporting former soviet guerrillas fighting in siberia. as a result, this united states has become far more socially conservative. because there was no sixties upsurge of social liberalism and decriminalisation of homosexuality in (nazi-occupied) western europe in this world, the latter is still a felony, while racial segregation is still active. steve turns out to be homosexual, and when he discovers michael's background, he marvels at his talk of gay pride marches, urban gay communities, and a mass social movement in michael's world of origin, regarding it as "utopian". much to his surprise, michael reciprocates steve's feelings, and realises that he too is gay. michael is apprehended by the authorities, who believe that he is a possible spy. michael learns that the water from the well in hitler's home town was used to create "braunau water", which was the instrument to sterilise the european jews, wiping them out in one generation. in a cruel twist of fate, the person who perfected the synthesis was dietrich bauer. once more his physicist son, axel, is wracked with guilt and has developed a temporal imager. with michael and steve's help, they plan to send a dead rat to poison the well so that it will be pumped clean of the sterilising water. as they begin to do this, they are interrupted by the federal agents that apprehended michael earlier and they end up shooting steve, who dies in michael's arms just as the time alteration occurs. time changes again. expecting the disorientation, michael comes to his senses faster now and discovers that almost everything is back to how it was, except that his favorite band never existed. he gives up his career in academia, figuring he can at least make some money "writing" the songs that he remembers from the previous reality. finally, michael is reunited with steve, who also remembers the previous reality. their gay relationship is no longer criminal. ||| 5 ||| 5
the novel is told from the first person, the first sentence being, “my name is erin law.” the author then introduces the other characters, and indeed, tells the entire story, through her. erin lives at whitegates, a home for "damaged children". erin's father was a foreign sailor who left her mother after a brief affair. years later, errin was grief-stricken when her mother died. many of the other children at whitegates. whitegates is run by a well-meaning but flawed woman named maureen. erin and january carr and some other children frequently reject her superficial, half-hearted attempts at therapy. january carr is erin’s “running-away-friend”, and the two often escape from comfortable but suppressive whitegates to live out of dumpsters in the city. one day, january decides to build a raft and float away down the river. before leaving, wilson cairns tries to show erin that the clay figures he is constantly molding actually come to life. erin and january leave with their raft, but mouse gullane and his pet mouse squeak insist on coming with them, mouse tries to bribe them with money and small plastic toys he has dug out of the ground (one day mouse hopes to uncover something really important buried in the earth). the others eventually allow him to come, even though they worry for the younger child’s safety. and indeed, they all almost die, as the raft is hurled along the fast-moving, polluted river and carried into the black middens, where they are all nearly engulfed by the mud. however, a strange young girl named heaven eyes rescues them. she cries, “is you my sister? is these mine brothers?” an old man whom heaven eyes refers to as grampa tells her that they are not and that they should be dug back into the middens. but she insists on bringing erin, january, mouse and squeak into their home; a huge old stone building decorated with stone statues of angels. it is very close to the river. the building contains an old printing press, as well as boxes of corned beef, raisins, and chocolates. grampa is still distrustful of the new children. grampa is constantly writing in a book in which he records every thing he sees in and around the middens. heaven eyes shows them around the building, and erin gets lost in a deep cellar, where she becomes spiritually lost and her despair over the death of her mother overcomes her. heaven eyes rescues her once more, stating that she must be careful as there are holes where one can slip into another place, a place of darkness. grampa becomes more tolerant of erin and her friends and allows them to help him dig in the middens, which mouse particularly enjoys. january, whoever, is very distrustful of grampa and thinks they should leave. he begins to snoop around, despite grampa’s warning, “no shenanigans”, and discovers evidence that heaven eyes was a child aboard a ship with her family. he suspects grampa of kidnap and murder. when they find a body in the black middens, january feels vindicated, to the point that he threatens to leave the others behind and escape on his own if they refuse to come. grampa becomes enraged and dangerous when he discovers january has been snooping. heaven eyes claims the body is a “saint”. that night, errin and january dig up the body and discover that it is the mummified body of a dock-side worker that has lain in the mud for many, many years. they bring the body (or the”saint”), back to land, and heaven eyes makes a bed for him. grampa’s affection for all of them strengthens, and then, to their grief (especially heaven eyes’), he dies. “lovely as lovely,” he says when heaven eyes tells him that erin and her friends are her brothers and sisters. then he becomes “dead as dead,” according to heaven eyes. then the mummified body of the saint comes to life and guides grampa’s spirit over the black middens and down into sparkling waters. when construction vehicles come to tear down the old building, and erect modern businesses in its place, errin and her friends manage to rescue many of the treasures, including grampa’s huge book. then they take heaven eyes, whom they now call anna may, back to whitegates, where the extraordinary child is able to heal maureen’s “damaged” soul. maureen is able to finally become a true mother to the abandoned and orphaned children of whitegates. miraculously, january’s mother appears to take him home, and she is just as he imagined her. at whitegates, wison cairns’ clay figures really do come to life. erin and her friends vow to solve the mysteries of bygone decades recorded in grampa’s book, and to continue his work. errin explains that this story has no end and is part of all the other stories of the world. ||| 7 ||| 2
the sequence details the various struggles for power on a world dominated by the malazan empire. it is notable for the use of high magic, and unusual plot structure.. gardens of the moon centres around the imperial campaign to conquer the city of darujhistan. the novel opens in the 96th year of the malazan empire, during the final year of the emperor kellanved. a young boy named ganoes paran witnesses the sacking of the mouse quarter of malaz city. paran wants to be a soldier when he grows older. commander whiskeyjack disapproves, as does claw leader surly (laseen). erikson skips seven years from the prologue, during which time the emperor and his ally, dancer, have been assassinated and supplanted by his chief of the secret police. empress laseen now rules with the aid of the "claw," a shadowy group of assassins whose function is to further her ambitions. the story opens several years into a series of wars by the malazan empire to conquer the continent of genabackis. the malazan 2nd army under high fist dujek has been besieging the city of pale, one of only two free cities left in the malazans' path in genabackis, for several years. pale is holding out thanks to an alliance with the powerful anomander rake, lord of moon's spawn (a floating fortress), leader of the non-human tiste andii. pale finally falls when rake withdraws his fortress following a fierce battle. even then, the empire suffers severe losses, including the near total destruction of a legendary infantry unit in its 2nd army, the bridgeburners. several characters speculate that someone higher up within the empire may be engineering the elimination of various people who were loyal to the late emperor. the empire then turns its attention to the other remaining free city, darujhistan. the few dozen surviving members of the bridgeburners, led by sergeant whiskeyjack, are sent to try and undermine the city from within. once there they attempt fruitlessly to contact the city's assassin's guild, in the hope of hiring their betrayal. adjunct lorn, a high ranking representative of the empress, is sent to uncover something in the hills east of darujhistan, in the company of a tlan imass, a member of another species that once dominated the world before humans. meanwhile tattersail, one of the few mages to survive the battle of pale, and captain paran head toward the city to determine the reason for the increased involvement of several gods and other magical forces in the campaign. at the same time, anomander rake offers his alliance to the true rulers of darujhistan, a secretive cabal of mages; while a group of con-artists and underworld figures within the city work to oppose members of the civic government who are considering capitulating to the empire. the plots collide when adjunct lorn releases a jaghut tyrant, a massively powerful being from thousands of years ago, with the aim of either damaging anomander rake seriously or forcing him to withdraw from the city. a substantial subplot involves a young bridgeburner recruit named sorry, who is in fact possessed by the rope, patron of assassins. when paran and rake negotiate his withdrawal from the war, she is freed and falls in with crokus, a young daru thief. as the novel ends crokus, a bridgeburner named fiddler and the bridgeburner assassin kalam volunteer to take the former sorry (now called apsalar) back to her homeland of itko kan and they depart (their story continues in deadhouse gates). meanwhile, dujek and whiskeyjack lead the 2nd army into rebellion against laseen's increasingly monstrous rule. now called onearm's host, the 2nd army calls for a truce with the tiste andii and the crimson guard, a mercenary army that has been working against the empire. dujek is also concerned about the declaration of holy war called by the pannion seer, whose empire is advancing from the south-east of genabackis. darujhistan has evaded conquest by the malazan empire, for now, but may be in danger from this new threat. elsewhere, it is confirmed that seven cities has begun a mass-uprising against the empire. these and other plot developments are continued in the third novel, memories of ice. ||| 2 ||| 2

big planet had been colonized hundreds of years prior to the start of the novel by misfits, faddists, cultists and anti-government advocates from earth. it devolved into a large number of technologically backward societies, many of them ruled by petty tyrants and prey to internecine warfare. investigators from earth, headed by protagonist claude glystra, arrive to start putting things right – to stop the importation of arms and halt big planet's slave trade – only to have their starship sabotaged. it crashes near a quaint village called jubilith, and glystra, one of the survivors, awakens to the jewel-bright morning light of a flowery mountain slope--with a view "vast beyond earthly conception." unfortunately, jubilith is near the territory of charley lysidder, the bajarnum of beaujolais, one of the worst and most ambitious of tyrants. the survivors attempt to reach the only safe spot on big planet, earth enclave, forty thousand miles away. already at odds with each other, the dwindling team begins to revert to the social level of the rest of big planet as lysidder tries to pick them off. among the many societies benign or bizarre that glystra and his companions encounter along the wind-driven monoline (their version of the yellow brick road), is the quasi-utopian society of kirstendale. at first, it appears to be based on snobbish principles, but an odd twist reveals it to be surprisingly egalitarian. ||| 5 ||| 5

the novel opens in london in 632 (ad 2540 in the gregorian calendar). the vast majority of the population is unified under the world state, an eternally peaceful, stable global society in which goods and resources are plentiful (because the population is permanently limited to no more than two billion people) and everyone is happy. natural reproduction has been done away with and children are created, 'decanted' and raised in hatcheries and conditioning centres, where they are divided into five castes (which are further split into 'plus' and 'minus' members) and designed to fulfill predetermined positions within the social and economic strata of the world state. fetuses chosen to become members of the highest caste, 'alpha', are allowed to develop naturally while maturing to term in "decanting bottles", while fetuses chosen to become members of the lower castes ('beta', 'gamma', 'delta', 'epsilon') are subjected to in situ chemical interference to cause arrested development in intelligence or physical growth. each 'alpha' or 'beta' is the product of one unique fertilized egg developing into one unique fetus. members of lower castes are not unique but are instead created using the bokanovsky process which enables a single egg to spawn (at the point of the story being told) up to 96 children and one ovary to produce thousands of children. to further increase the birthrate of gammas, deltas and epsilons, podsnap's technique causes all the eggs in the ovary to mature simultaneously, allowing the hatchery to get full use of the ovary in two years' time. people of these castes make up the majority of human society, and the production of such specialized children bolsters the efficiency and harmony of society, since these people are deliberately limited in their cognitive and physical abilities, as well as the scope of their ambitions and the complexity of their desires, thus rendering them easier to control. all children are educated via the hypnopaedic process, which provides each child with caste-appropriate subconscious messages to mold the child's lifelong self-image and social outlook to that chosen by the leaders and their predetermined plans for producing future adult generations. to maintain the world state's command economy for the indefinite future, all citizens are conditioned from birth to value consumption with such platitudes as "ending is better than mending," "more stiches less riches" i.e., buy a new item instead of fixing the old one, because constant consumption, and near-universal employment to meet society's material demands, is the bedrock of economic and social stability for the world state. beyond providing social engagement and distraction in the material realm of work or play, the need for transcendence, solitude and spiritual communion is addressed with the ubiquitous availability and universally endorsed consumption of the drug soma. soma is an allusion to a mythical drink of the same name consumed by ancient indo-aryans. in the book, soma is a hallucinogen that takes users on enjoyable, hangover-free "holidays". it was developed by the world state to provide these inner-directed personal experiences within a socially managed context of state-run 'religious' organizations; social clubs. the hypnopaedically inculcated affinity for the state-produced drug, as a self-medicating comfort mechanism in the face of stress or discomfort, thereby eliminates the need for religion or other personal allegiances outside or beyond the world state. recreational sex is an integral part of society. according to the world state, sex is a social activity, rather than a means of reproduction (sex is encouraged from early childhood). the few women who can reproduce are conditioned to use birth control, even wearing a "malthusian belt" (which resembles a cartridge belt and holds "the regulation supply of contraceptives") as a popular fashion accessory. the maxim "everyone belongs to everyone else" is repeated often, and the idea of a "family" is considered pornographic; sexual competition and emotional, romantic relationships are rendered obsolete because they are no longer needed. marriage, natural birth, parenthood, and pregnancy are considered too obscene to be mentioned in casual conversation. thus, society has developed a new idea of reproductive comprehension. spending time alone is considered an outrageous waste of time and money, and wanting to be an individual is horrifying. conditioning trains people to consume and never to enjoy being alone, so by spending an afternoon not playing "obstacle golf," or not in bed with a friend, one is forfeiting acceptance. in the world state, people typically die at age 60 having maintained good health and youthfulness their whole life. death isn't feared; anyone reflecting upon it is reassured by the knowledge that everyone is happy, and that society goes on. since no one has family, they have no ties to mourn. the conditioning system eliminates the need for professional competitiveness; people are literally bred to do their jobs and cannot desire another. there is no competition within castes; each caste member receives the same food, housing, and soma rationing as every other member of that caste. there is no desire to change one's caste, largely because a person's sleep-conditioning reinforces each individual's place in the caste system. to grow closer with members of the same class, citizens participate in mock religious services called solidarity services, in which twelve people consume large quantities of soma and sing hymns. the ritual progresses through group hypnosis and climaxes in an orgy. in geographic areas nonconducive to easy living and consumption, securely contained groups of "savages" are left to their own devices. these appear to be similar to the reservations of land established for the native american population during the colonisation of north america. these 'savages' are beholden of strange customs, including self-mutilation and religion, a mere curio in the outside world. in its first chapters, the novel describes life in the world state as wonderful and introduces lenina crowne and bernard marx. lenina, a hatchery worker, is socially accepted and comfortable with her place in society, while bernard, a psychologist, is an outcast. although an alpha plus, bernard is shorter in stature than the average of his caste—a quality shared by the lower castes, which gives him an inferiority complex. his work with sleep-teaching has led him to realize that what others believe to be their own deeply held beliefs are merely phrases repeated to children while they are asleep. still, he recognizes the necessity of such programming as the reason why his society meets the emotional needs of its citizens. courting disaster, he is vocal about being different, once stating he dislikes soma because he'd "rather be himself." bernard's differences fuel rumors that he was accidentally administered alcohol while incubated, a method used to keep epsilons short. bernard's only friend is helmholtz watson, an alpha plus lecturer at the college of emotional engineering (department of writing). the friendship is based on their similar experiences as misfits, but unlike bernard, watson's sense of loneliness stems from being too gifted, too intelligent, too handsome, and too physically strong. helmholtz is drawn to bernard as a confidant: he can talk to bernard about his desire to write poetry. bernard is on holiday at a savage reservation. the reservation, located in new mexico, consists of a community named malpais. from afar, lenina thinks it will be exciting. in person, she finds the aged, toothless natives who mend their clothes rather than throw them away repugnant, and the situation is made worse when she discovers that she has left her soma tablets at the resort hotel. in typical tourist fashion, bernard and lenina watch what at first appears to be a quaint native ceremony. the village folk, whose culture resembles the contemporary indian groups of the region, descendants of the anasazi, including the puebloan peoples of acoma, laguna, and zuni, and the ramah navajo, begin by singing, but the ritual quickly becomes a passion play where a village boy is whipped to unconsciousness. soon after, the couple encounters linda, a woman who has been living in malpais since she came on a trip and became separated from her group, among whom was a man to whom she refers as "tomakin" but who is revealed to be bernard's boss, the director of hatcheries and conditioning, thomas. she became pregnant despite adhering to her "malthusian drill" and there were no facilities for an abortion. her shame at pregnancy was so great that she decided not to return to her old life, but to stay with the "savages". linda gave birth to a son, john (later referred to as john the savage) who is now 18. conversations with linda and john reveal that their life has been hard. for 18 years, they have been treated as outsiders: the native men treated linda like a sex object while the native women regularly beat and ostracized her because of her promiscuity, and john was mistreated and excluded for his mother's actions and the color of his skin. john was angered by linda's lovers, and even attacked one in a jealous rage while a child. john's one joy was that his mother had taught him to read, although he only had two books: a scientific manual from his mother's job, which he called a "beastly, beastly book," and a collection of shakespeare's works (which have been banned in the world state for being subversive). shakespeare gives john articulation to his feelings, though, and he especially is interested in othello, romeo and juliet, and hamlet. at the same time, john has been denied the religious rituals of the village, although he has watched them and even has had some religious experiences on his own in the desert. old, weathered and tired, linda wants to return to her familiar world in london, as she misses living in the city and taking soma. john wants to see the "brave new world" his mother has told him so much about. bernard wants to take them back to block thomas from his plan to reassign bernard to iceland as punishment for his asocial beliefs. bernard arranges permission for linda and john to leave the reservation. john also seems to have an attraction to lenina, as while bernard is away, getting the permission to move the savages, he finds her suitcase and ruffles through all of her clothes, taking in the smells. he then sees her "sleeping" and stares at her, thinking all he has to do to see her properly is undo one zip. he later tells himself off for being like this towards lenina, and seems to be extremely shy around her. upon his return to london, bernard is confronted by thomas, the director of the hatchery and conditioning centre who, in front of an audience of higher-caste centre workers, denounces bernard for his asocial behavior. bernard, thinking that for the first time in his life he has the upper hand, defends himself by presenting the director with his long-lost lover and unknown son, linda and john. john falls to his knees and calls thomas his father, which causes an uproar of laughter. the humiliated director resigns in shame. spared from reassignment, bernard makes john the toast of london. pursued by the highest members of society, able to bed any woman he fancies, bernard revels in attention he once scorned. the victory, however, is short-lived. linda, decrepit, toothless, and friendless, goes on a permanent soma holiday while john, appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society, refuses to attend bernard's parties. society drops bernard as swiftly as it had taken him. bernard turns to the person he'd believed to be his one true friend, only to see helmholtz fall into a quick, easy camaraderie with john. bernard is left an outcast yet again as he watches the only two men with whom he ever connected find more of interest in each other than they ever did in him. john and helmholtz's island of peace is brief. lenina tries to seduce john, but john pushes her away, calling her out on her sexually wanton ways. whilst lenina is in the bathroom, humiliated and putting her clothes on, john receives a telephone call from the hospital telling him that his mother is extremely unwell. he rushes over to see her and sits at her bedside, trying to get her out of her soma holiday so that he can talk to her. he is heartbroken when his mother succumbs to soma and dies. he is extremely annoyed by the young boys that enter the ward to be conditioned about death and annoy john to the point where he starts to use violence to send them away. john's grief bewilders and revolts the hospital workers, and their lack of reaction to linda's death prompts john to try to force humanity from the workers by throwing their soma rations out a window. the ensuing riot brings the police, who quell the riot by filling the room with soma. bernard and helmholtz arrive to help john, but only helmholtz helps him, while bernard stands to the side, torn between risking involvement by helping or escaping the scene. following the riot, bernard, helmholtz and john are brought before mustapha mond, the resident world controller for western europe. bernard (who breaks down during the middle of the conversation) and helmholtz are told they will be exiled to islands of their choice. mond explains that this exile is not so much a threat to force freethinkers to reform and rejoin society as it is a chance for them to act as they please because they will not be able to influence the population. he also divulges that he too once risked banishment to an island because of some scientific experiments that were deemed controversial by the state, giving insight into his sympathetic tone. helmholtz chooses the falkland islands, believing that their terrible weather will inspire his writing, but bernard simply does not want to leave london; he struggles with mond and is thrown out of the office. after bernard and helmholtz have left, mustapha and john engage in a philosophical argument on the morals behind the existing society and then john is told the "experiment" will continue and he will not be sent to an island. john meets with bernard and helmholtz once again before their departures from london and bernard apologizes to john for his opportunistic behavior, having come to terms with his imminent exile and having restored his friendship with helmholtz. in the final chapter, john isolates himself from society in a lighthouse outside london where he finds his hermit life interrupted from mourning his mother by the more bitter memories of civilization. to atone, john brutally whips himself in the open, a ritual the indians in his own village had denied him. his self-flagellation, caught on film and shown publicly, destroys his hermit life. hundreds of gawking sightseers, intrigued by john's violent behavior, fly out to watch the savage in person. even lenina comes to watch, crying a tear john does not see. the sight of the woman whom he both adores and blames is too much for him; john attacks and whips her. this sight of genuine, unbridled emotion drives the crowd wild with excitement, and — handling it as they are conditioned to — they turn on each other, in a frenzy of beating and chanting that devolves into a mass orgy of soma and sex. in the morning, john, hopeless, alone, horrified by his drug use and the orgy in which he participated that countered his beliefs, makes one last attempt to escape civilization and atone. when thousands of gawking sightseers arrive that morning, frenzied at the prospect of seeing the savage perform again, they find john dead from a suicidal hanging. ||| 0 ||| 5
the prologue opens on a battlefield, "the night before the end of the world", over the bodies of two fallen giants. the massive machine and wood giants had destroyed one another and were now the meeting place for the lieutenants of the armies preparing for battle. ashnod the uncaring and tawnos meet to discuss matters and reminisce about the war that brought them to that field. the main story opens at an archaeological dig site a few decades earlier. the head archaeologist, tocasia, sits at her table examining an ancient relic: a metal skull. when the supply caravan from the city arrives to the camp, tocasia meets two brothers around the age of ten. the older boy, lean and tawny-haired, is urza, while his dark-haired and stocky younger brother is mishra. urza tells tocasia that he and mishra were born on the same year, he on the first day, mishra on the last, so that on the last day, they were equal. tocasia takes the boys into the camp to teach them her archeology. from the beginning, urza and mishra show a great aptitude for the study of 'artifacts', machines left over from the mysterious thran people, and also show a violent capacity for argument curbed only by tocasia. over the next six years the brothers grow up in the camp, urza becoming lean, wiry, and developing an encyclopedic mind for mechanics. mishra grew muscular, learning to spend time with the native fallaji diggers, drinking with them and learning their legends. they become permanent residents of the camp, after receiving word that their father died, and their stepmother does not send for them. after the discovery and rebuilding of an ancient flying machine (an ornithopter), on mishra's birthday, the brothers have a vicious argument over who gets to fly it first. in the end urza wins, but both get a turn. the bird's eye view allows them to view pictographs in the desert, leading to the discovery of large artifact deposits. these discoveries point to a mountainous region that urza believes was the heart of thran civilization, but which the desert natives think is haunted. urza, mishra, and tocasia fly to the ruined thran city but are attacked by a roc along the way. at the heart of the ruined city, a cave entrance leads down past troves of machines to a pedestal with a large crystal set into the middle. accidentally, the brothers break the stone in half, and each has a differing vision when they each end with a half in his grasp. urza sees a world of metal cables and machines with many melting and burning forms. mishra saw a long hallway made of lizard skin, with tiny figurines of screaming beings made of gold and mirrors showing him twisted images of a monster. when they awake from their visions, they see the automatons in the hall come to life and attack them. they discover mishra's stone weakens the machines, while urza's strengthens them. after escaping, urza and mishra get into a heated argument when urza takes mishra's stone. in frustration, urza lashes his hand out to return the stone, while mishra steps into his reach and is struck in the forehead with the stone. this results in a falling-out between the brothers. in the months after, the brothers remained angry. urza deems his stone the mightstone for its ability to strengthen, and mishra's the weakstone for its ability to weaken. one night, an argument between the brothers escalates to a violent pitch, where they begin using the powers of the stones on one another. tocasia rushes in to stop them and is caught in the cross fire and killed. in grief and pain at the accusations of his older brother, mishra flees into the night. without tocasia's leadership, the camp disbands and the students and workers return to their homes. after the deadly night, urza leaves the camp without knowing of his brother's whereabouts. in the city of kroog, capital of the neighbouring kingdom of yotia, he becomes a clockmaker's apprentice. and first meets kayla bin-kroog, the yotian princess, after fixing a music box of sentimental value. upon learning that a thran book is a part of the princess's dowry, he builds a mechanical man to win a contest set forth by kayla's father to find her a strong suitor. the mechanical man moves a massive jade statue and urza wins the contest. the warlord father is initially infuriated that urza wins the contest, but is persuaded to allow the marriage when he realizes that he can use urza's knowledge for himself. meanwhile, mishra is enslaved by the desert people. he is made a tutor for the son of the ruling tribe's chief. the son is initially uninterested in learning arithmetic or other languages and mishra despairs that he will be demoted (though his friend hajar knows failure will mean death) like many previous tutors who failed before him. mishra manages to befriend the boy by telling him many legends and stories. however, mishra is still a slave that will be executed upon the completion of the boy's education. one night, a massive mechanical dragon attacks the tribe, killing the chieftain. mishra tames it with his stone and is promoted from a slave to being a "wizard" and advisor to the son, who succeeds his father as chieftain. with the kroogian warlord's patronage, urza begins a school for the creation of many devices and takes on an apprentice, tawnos. mishra takes on his apprentice, ashnod when the desert fallaji people begin their war against the other kingdoms. urza's yotian kingdom and mishra's fallaji begin to war, but hold a peace talk. the brothers are reunited, but the kroogian warlord uses the peace talks as a pretense to launch a surprise attack against his hated fallaji enemies. the kroogian warlord is killed by the fallaji chieftain in the ensuing battle. a war erupts, but another peace talk is held and urza and mishra attempt to reconcile their broken relationship. however, the talks break down when mishra has kayla steal urza's stone and sleeps with her. with the aide of his war machines, mishra escapes into the desert. urza mounts a search for his brother in the hopes of getting revenge, leading to another war. after an unsuccessful attack by urza's ornithopter patrols on a false warcamp, mishra attacks the kroogian capital with three of his dragon engines (having found and tamed two more). the fallaji chieftain attempts to kill ashnod during the attack on the city, but fails and is killed by her instead. in the caverns where the stones were found, men who worshipped machines met a mostly mechanical demon from another world. he called himself gix, and they did as well. mishra becomes the new leader of the fallaji, and builds himself an army of automatons to increase his military power. urza flees the now-conquered kroog and is appointed "protector of the realm" by an alliance formed against the fallaji by the kingdoms of argive and korlis. tawnos brings urza's wife and newborn son (possibly nephew) to him, and together they begin to build an opposing army to mishra. ashnod builds her own army of brainwashed and surgically altered slaves and criminals, the transmogrants, to fight. the war continues for decades with each side participating in an arms race to build more effective weapons. ashnod is exiled from mishra's side, while loran joins a group of scholars in unlocking the power of magic in the city terisia. when mishra invades, two of his dragon engines vanish into thin air. the brotherhood of gix infiltrates both sides and plays them against each other, while winning more power in mishra's court. mishra is secretly offered a method of gaining more power through artifice by the brotherhood. urza's son harbin finds an island of argoth, ruled by elves who worship the goddess gaea, and was secretly aided to return to land by an elf. in a ploy to bring the brother's together, gix gives information on the secret island to a member of the brotherhood. urza and mishra both learn that this island is rich in resources like lumber and ore. because their war has stripped the continent of resources and polluted the land, they bring their armies to the island in the hopes gaining the upper hand and ending the war decisively. both armies exterminate the natives of the island. in the final battle of the war, the brothers' armies fight to a stalemate. urza meets mishra upon the battlefield, but mishra has been warped into an amalgamation of machine-and-man by gix, the phyrexian demon. ashnod sends the golgothian sylex to urza to end the war while she fights the demon gix. urza, suddenly awakening to the power of magic, uses the golgothian sylex to unleash an enormous blast to destroy his brother and gix. the blast destroys the island, ends the war and upsets the climate of dominaria, ushering in a new ice age. gix escapes through a portal to the plane of phyrexia. urza becomes a planeswalker, a god-like being capable of traversing between worlds, and the mightstone and weakstone become his eyes. regretting the destruction he has unleashed upon the world, urza uses his newfound powers to leave dominaria and travel to worlds unseen. ja:magic urza & mishra pl:bratobójcza wojna ru:война

chronologically, once a hero directly follows winning colors, even overlapping partially, but the focus distinctly shifts to young esmay suiza, who came to prominence after successfully leading a mutiny against her traitorous captain and intervening to decisive effect in the battle of xavier (as winning colors records). suiza is not immediately praised and feted for her heroism, however, for her actions demand official scrutiny. thorough and complete, neither the board of inquiry nor the court-martial find suiza guilty of anything, and so she is allowed to take a vacation before her next assignment. back home on altiplano, esmay is honored with altiplano's highest award, the starmount, although she remains convinced that she was not really a hero, that it was blind luck. while talking with an old soldier who had served under her father (one of the four highest military commanders on altiplano) and was a family friend, she learns that the nightmares and her dislike of command and horses were psychological trauma from when, as a child, she had ventured into a warzone seeking her father. she had been waylaid and molested by one of her father's subordinates; the family friend knew this sordid tale because he had been the one to kill that subordinate, whose politically connected father meant any trial was infeasible. he felt free to tell her since he assumed that suiza's father's coverup had failed to convince suiza that the memories were merely nightmares during an illness or fragments of her imagination. this revelation precipitates a break with her father. meanwhile, some mendacious and greedy civilian contractors for the fleet have agreed to carry out a job for the barbarian space-warriors of the bloodhorde: they would take a fleet contract to rekey the command sequences of various missiles, and when they were aboard the specified massive deep space repair vessel, covertly disable its self-destruct mechanism. this job would pave the way for the bloodhorde boarding team. by a remarkable coincidence, it is this very same dsr, the koskiuskos ("kos" for short) which suiza is assigned to. after catching a resupply vehicle to the kos, suiza is assigned to a major pitak in hulls and architecture; pitak immediately begins running esmay ragged with errands and learning everything she needs to know about spaceship structural design and how to repair and fix vessels. in her spare time, suiza slowly begins assembling a circle of friends, especially one ensign barin serrano (last seen in winning colors hand-delivering a message to heris serrano from vida serrano before the battle of xavier). as the months pass by suiza settles in; so do the traitorous civilian contractors who productively improve the hours by disabling the self-destruct without tripping the monitors. inevitably, the bloodhorde launches its attack, crippling the patrol ship wraith. wraith is repairable, but is incapable of further safe ftl jumps. so the kos goes out to meet it, since it is in the neighborhood, although the danger of pulling the kos out of its normal routes and so near bloodhorde space is very real. suiza is sent by major pitak to take pictures of the forward section of the hull to ascertain the full extent of the damage. suiza discovers instead the first prong of the bloodhorde plan: a massive mine was planted on wraith, programmed to wait until wraith was brought into one of the kos's repair bays and then detonate; this would incapacitate the kos and make it easy meat for the waiting bloodhorde assault group. thanks to suiza's presence of mind, the mine is safely disarmed. but all is not well. the bloodhorde's plan is remarkably subtle (for the bloodhorde): though the first prong has been deflected, the second was yet to strike. after the mine is disposed of, repairs continue in earnest on the wraith. forward of the mine, some 25 crew members are discovered knocked out by sleeping-gas and are taken into the hospital facilities. despite their location, open to space, they are uniformly uninjured, and eventually scattered across the kos to help out. one interacts with suiza. his manner strikes her as drastically unlike that of a fleet member, and more reminiscent of commandos she had known. after making inquiries as to their location (most had vanished), whether they were injured at all like they should have been, and whether any senior wraith officers recognize them, it is concluded that kos has been boarded by bloodhorde commandos seeking to capture the dsr and massively upgrade the bloodhorde's industrial infrastructure and especially its military construction capability, greatly increasing its killing power. the captain immediately orders everybody's identification checked against their dna and fresh ids issued. during the change-over, the bloodhorde kidnaps barin serrano, taking him as a hostage. with the kos' ftl drive apparently broken and its self-destruct disabled, the higher-ups decide on a risky strategy of detaching the section of kos containing most of the intruders, and ambushing the expected followup wave of bloodhorde; while that wave was preoccupied boarding, they would attack the vessel and use it to either protect the kos until its escorts returned with reinforcements or destroy it. during a meeting with suiza to discuss how to suppress the commandos, the spoken-of commandos attack, cutting off most of the senior personnel with poison gas. they escape the cabin with the injured captain and link up with some personnel who had made it to the security lockers before the bloodhorde. they conclude that to lead an effective resistance, they have to lead it from the t-1 arm of the kos. but all the arms have been locked off from the core by the bloodhorde. so, they decide to go eva and go around. during the eva excursions, the kos is jumped through hyperspace. led by suiza, the crew of t-1 determine to retake the kos and ambush their ambushers. when the intruders relax their guard of the bridge, one of the bridge crew women risks her life to re-open the doors to the core (and by extension, enabling an assault on the bridge). the prepared security teams overcome the few commandos in the core and regain control easily - most of the commandos had gone to t-4 to eliminate the resistance there. the crew in t-4 had used their grace time profitably, arranging an elaborate drama for the benefit of the commandos, intended to convince them that they were fighting - and defeating - the ill-prepared armed resistance of the familias crew. the drama lures them to the repair bay, where (elated by their success), they don spacesuits and sortie out to welcome their warship into the repair bay. there it is trapped by an extremely strong adhesive. the two other warships dock without being trapped, and debark their crew in eva suits. the robots used for painting vessels attack them, blinding and immobilizing them. the two still-mobile bloodhorde ships are commandeered and the three remaining bloodhorde are easily destroyed, and the day saved. barin serrano is discovered alive, but much abused in mind and body. suiza is no less discomfited by her nightmares and anxieties. she and barin begin going to psychiatric care. eventually suiza begins to work through her phobia of sexual contact and assuming leadership. she transfers to "command track" and becomes intimate with barin. ||| 0 ||| 5
bosch and his partner ignacio ferras are called to investigate a murder at fortune liquors (which bosch had visited during the race riots at the end of angels flight), located in the l.a. ghetto. the owner, mr. li, has been murdered, leaving behind a grieving widow who did not speak english and two children: a daughter mia, who looked after her parents, and a son robert, who ran the second fortune liquors store in an upscale area. the wife had found her husband's body, and the asian gangs unit has been called, which leads to asian-american detective david chu, who is fluent in several chinese dialects, joining the investigation. although the killer took the day's security camera disk, bosch watches two saved disks from previous dates and finds that the owner made a $216 weekly payoff to a triad every week at about the time he was murdered. chu locates the bagman for the triad, and he and bosch arrest him just as he is about to flee to hong kong. the arrest is made on a friday, so that the man can be held without bail until monday morning. the victim had swallowed one of the casings ejected by the shooter's gun, and bosch requests the forensics lab to run a special, experimental test on the brass casing to reveal any latent fingerprints. however, at that point, bosch receives a phone threat and then a video message from his daughter maddie, who lives in hong kong and whom he only sees twice a year. the message simply shows her held in a hotel room, kidnapped. his ex-wife eleanor called the hong kong police, who told her that maddie was probably a runaway and to call back monday if she hadn't returned by then. bosch flies from l.a. to hong kong friday night/saturday, and then plans to spend sunday looking for maddie, while flying back sunday night to get in the office on monday morning (due to the time differentials). eleanor agrees to meet him at the airport. eleanor, who is a star attraction at a macau casino, has a personal security guard, sun yee, whom harry learns is also her boyfriend. although hong kong has strict gun control, sun yee arranges to get harry a gun. a video technician at the l.a.p.d. traced the image of maddy's kidnapping to a particular section of kowloon, and harry, eleanor and sun yee follow the trail to a high-rise multi-ethnic flophouse (a likely referral to chungking mansions), which eleanor refers to as a "post-modern casablanca, all in one building." to get access to the room in which maddie was being held, harry recklessly overpays, despite sun yee's cautioning. on the elevator up, harry and eleanor are separated from sun yee, and harry crashes into the room without waiting for him. they find evidence that maddie had been blood typed there, which would be done only if her kidnapping were part of china's black market in organ trading. upon leaving the room, harry and eleanor are approached by two armed men, and in the subsequent shoot-out, the men and eleanor are all killed. sun yee informs harry that the killers are not triad but were robbers out to steal the money that harry showed at the desk. harry then thrashes the desk clerk and takes his records of room rentals, managing to escape just ahead of the police. the room rental was done by "quick", the older brother of one of maddie's friends. he lived in tuen mun in the new territories, according to the records, but harry and sun yee find only three dead bodies—quick, his sister and their mother—in his apartment, as well as maddie's cell phone. the cell phone had been used to make one call to a tuen mun number before it was damaged, and harry calls chu back in l.a. to trace the number. harry and sun yee launch their own attempt to track down the kidnappers and succeed in luring them into a meeting, then follow their car upon leaving. chu manages to trace the phone call number to a triad-connected business called northstar, and the kidnappers' car is headed in the same direction. just before arriving at the business, the car turns, but harry and sun yee continue to northstar, where they find a guarded cargo ship. subsequently, the car also arrives there. figuring that maddie was on board the ship, harry charges it under cover and kills the kidnappers. although maddie is not on the boat, he finds maddie in the trunk of the car. with eleanor deceased, harry takes maddie back to l.a. upon his arrival, harry learns that nothing has happened in the fortune liquors case, in part because ferras did not work over the weekend, and harry tells ferras that he will request a new partner. the bagman is released on bail and flees the u.s. hong kong police arrive with a demand for bosch's extradition, and they have a confession signed by sun yee that has a number of inaccuracies in it, which makes it obvious to bosch that sun yee is not cooperating and may have been tortured. bosch comes to the meeting with them accompanied by his lawyer (and half-brother) mickey haller, who threatens to turn this into a front-page story about the dangers faced by americans in hong kong, especially since the hong kong police were called about maddie's kidnapping but refused to help. the hong kong police leave without pursuing charges and also agree to release sun yee. at the same time, the experimental test produces a fingerprint on the casing—but the fingerprint belongs to hollywood screenwriter henry lau, not the triad bagman. when bosch and chu visit him, they find the gun used for the murder, which he keeps in his home. he tells them that he was in a script meeting the entire day of the shooting (and in a nod to hollywood by connelly, when asked who could vouch for him, lau name-drops actor matthew mcconaughey, who portrays haller in the film adaptation of the lincoln lawyer). while escorting lau out of the house, bosch notices lau's framed college diploma on the wall, from the same university and graduation year as the one hanging in robert li's office. lau reveals that he and robert were roommates in college, along with li's assistant manager eugene lam, and that the threesome plays cards at lau's house each week. bosch and chu arrest lam, whom they believe to be the killer, while leaving ferras to follow robert li. lam reveals that the entire murder was a plot concocted by mia to relieve her of the burden of her parents; robert had come up with the idea of disguising it as a triad killing. when bosch and chu inform ferras, he decides to single-handedly arrest robert li as an act of defiance against bosch—but he is killed by mia during the arrest. mia then commits suicide. after ferras' funeral, maddie confesses to harry that the "kidnapping" was originally a fake that she planned, to get her mother to agree to let her live with harry. however, when presented with the opportunity, quick turned it into a real kidnapping, making the deal with the triad from which harry saved her. maddie blames herself for the deaths, especially her mother, that followed. harry consoles her, promising to show her how they can make up for their mistakes. ||| 1 ||| 6
the book begins with jacques dubrinsky, younger brother to mikhail, being tortured and buried alive by members of the same fanatical group that attacked raven and killed his sister some 25 years earlier in dark prince. as time goes on he loses much of his memory (perhaps even his sanity), the only thing he has a clear memory of is of the faces of his human tormentors, the vampire who betrayed him to the society, and of the woman who will save him. shea o’halloran is a brilliant american surgeon and researcher trying to find the cure for a rare blood disorder. her pursuit of a cure is personal; she also suffers from the disease, and she fears that one day it will kill her. she occasionally has to have blood transfusions in order to survive. it is only after her mother maggie commits suicide that she learns that she has inherited this disorder from her father. in her diary, her mother writes of having an affair with a man named rand. she writes that he takes her blood when they make love. unfortunately he’s a married man whose wife recently gave birth to a son and disappears before maggie can tell him of her pregnancy. she believes that his wife noelle discovered his infidelity and murdered him. the loss of shea's father devastates maggie, and she retreats from the world, even her own child. shea suffers a stark and painful childhood. maggie commits suicide when shea turns 18. this disorder is not her only difference. no human medicine works on her; she can hear and feel the thoughts of others. when she touches a patient, she instantly knows what is wrong with him/her. because of this, she’s tracked by the same vampire hunting society that has imprisoned jacques, believing she too is a vampire. they even show her pictures of seven others that they have caught and murdered. no matter where she goes, they always track her down. one day shea is racked by horrendous pain and visions of a man being tortured. for years she dreams of this man. after the society finds her again, she goes to the carpathian mountains to do further research on her disorder. she feels that since there are many legends of vampires in the region that this may be the epicenter of the disease. when she goes for a walk, she’s compelled to go to a spot deep in the forest. she finds a cellar where a man has been tortured and buried alive with a stake driven through his body. suddenly he awakens and attacks her, twice feeding on her blood. she has a compulsion to help him, despite his violent assault. she takes him to her home and treats his wounds. after he takes her blood for the third time, she becomes violently ill. the next day, when she asks who he is, jacques is stunned. he always knew she was his lifemate then recites the ritual words, binding them for all time. he tells her that she doesn’t have a disease, but that they are a different race of people who need blood to survive. shea refuses to believe this at first. then she realizes that she doesn’t have normal human bodily functions. she soon realizes that this is the truth and that her father was a being just like jacques. after a few days, shea has to leave jacques to get more blood from the blood bank. she is spotted by another carpathian, byron, who realizes by her smell that she’s been in contact with jacques. he immediately informs mikhail. when they arrive, they see shea apparently torturing jacques; mikhail attacks her thinking she is deranged. this triggers jacques’ protective instincts and he tries to kill them. mikhail calls gregori, their race’s most powerful healer, who convinces jacques to allow them to heal him. the next evening, shea and jacques tell her life story. shea was (before being converted by jacques) half-human, half-carpathian, something that was considered impossible. they also think that her birth confirms that a psychic human woman who is a lifemate to a carpathian is capable of giving birth to female children. this is vitally important because their people are on the verge of extinction; no female has been born in more than 500 years. they inform her that her father is not dead, and it was noelle who was murdered. they also tell her that her half-brother was also killed by the society. jacques also relates what happened to him, how a vampire delivered him to the human killers. before they can discover who the vampire might be, byron is taken. raven is able to connect with him and determine that he is in a dark and dank room. shea realizes that he is being housed in the same place the humans buried jacques seven years earlier. while the men go to the cellar to rescue him, women stay behind. shea is almost immediately uneasy, but raven senses no threat. suddenly, the humans attack the women, shooting the pregnant raven. luckily shea and gregori are able to save raven and her child. the attack is puzzling because no one but shea felt any threat. there is only one explanation for this; her father rand is the vampire. this means that it was rand who delivered his own son and jacques to the men to be tortured. gregori is selected to hunt rand, but rand attacks jacques, who is forced to destroy him. ||| 2 ||| 2
a teenager named alfred kropp lives in a small apartment with his uncle farrel, who is a security guard. he stays mostly secluded, both at home and at school. a man named arthur myers calls alfred's uncle at work, and offers one million dollars for the return of an object stolen from him by uncle farrell's boss. basically, alfred has to break into the main office, find the safe, and steal the object himself, accidentally cutting himself on the blade of the sword. then when he is about to leave, he is attacked by three monks. a battle ensues, but alfred manages to defeat them with excalibur. alfred and uncle farrell manage to escape, where they are attacked by arthur myers. he steals the sword, and kills uncle farrell, sparing alfred. alfred meets bernard samson ( bernard is alfred´s dad), who explains to him that arthur myers was an alias of an international terrorist, who wanted control of bernard's sword, which was excalibur. bernard samson, the heir of lancelot, goes off to jativa, in spain, to try to reclaim the sword from myers, whom he knows as mogart. a member of an international organization called oipep interjects that their codename for mogart is 'the dragon'. when alfred asks samson if there is anything he can do to help, samson replies, "pray." alfred returns to his normal life unwillingly, and is taken into a foster home owned by a family called the tuttles. alfred, unsatisfied with his normal life, takes to hanging around the nearby town, particularly the cafes. there, alfred meets bennacio, a knight protector of the sword (and the lead monk who attacked him); he reveals that all the defenders, including samson, were killed, and the sword was lost. after relating this, bennacio leaves the coffee shop they were in and alfred follows him. alfred sees bennacio get attacked and attempts to save him. they go to bennacio's room at the marriott, where bennacio uses alfred's blood (where he cut himself) to heal the wound. bennacio explains to alfred that excalibur has the power to heal, and that having been cut by it, alfred has been granted the power to heal. the next day, bennacio is ready to leave without alfred, but he pleads to the knight to help in any way he can. bennacio offers alfred a chance to drive him. they drive to canada (in a koenigsegg ccx) and steal a ferrari enzo, but are attacked by more of mogart's henchmen. bennacio kills them when he has the chance and then continues on their journey. they stop at a deceased knight's house, where windimar's mother lets them stay. they leave the next day, and get attacked once again. this time there are six of them on suzuki hayabusas. alfred and bennacio continue through nova scotia, and hijack a jaguar because their ferrari was critically damaged. they then fly to france. in france, bennacio tells alfred that he is a descendant of lancelot, making him the heir to his father's title. then oipep offers to trade 10.5 billion dollars for the sword; however, mogart double crosses them and kills bennacio in the process, leaving alfred as the last man standing. mike arnold, a member of oipep who set up the exchange, is also revealed as a traitor at this time. bennacio's daughter, natalia, is taken by mogart, and held for a ransom. alfred personally travels to merlin's cave in england in order to save bennacio's daughter. here, in merlin's cave in tintagel, kropp finds his true destiny as the master of the sword. mogart is unable to kill him with it even though kropp is impaled upon the sword and pinned to the wall of merlin's caves underneath tintagel. as in the original king arthur stories, mogart is unable to pull the sword out of the stone as only the master of the sword can claim it. kropp, having healed himself with the sword, pulls the sword out of the stone, finishes off mogart, and returns home as a hero. at the end of the story, alfred finds that he yearns for more excitement and calls oipep, wanting a job fighting "agents of darkness." ||| 7 ||| 2
in sliding scales flinx is confounded by how to proceed with his life. he abandoned his injured girlfriend, clarity held, on the planet new riveria under the protection of his friends truzenzuzex and bran tse-mallory (see events in flinx's folly) with the understanding he would search the galaxy for the tar-aiym weapons platform that has once been in the system pyrassis. not knowing where to go to start the search, flinx first visits his homeworld of moth, then broods as his ship, teacher takes in aimlessly through the galazy. teacher’s ai suggests something unusual to take him out of his funk: a vacation. this is followed another surprising suggestion: that he take the vacation in an isolated world that falls within the reach of the aann empire, a near-desert planet named jast. the native sentient species of jast is the vssey, a single-sex species that resembles and acts much like a giant mobile mushroom. the vssey are loosely allied with the aann, though not yet a part of their empire. some members of the vssey are strongly opposed to a closer alliance, though the ruling government seeks to bring the two worlds closer together. flinx enters this unsettled atmosphere and is immediately suspected of being a spy for the humanx commonwealth. taken by secondary administrator takuuna vbxllw on what is to be a sightseeing tour of a canyon. either through accident or fortune takunna’s tail knocks flinx over the edge of the canyon and to his death. flinx manages to survive the fall, but with a head injury causing amnesia. he wanders the jast desert for several days before being rescued by a chraluuc, a member of a most unusual organization: an aann artist colony known as the tier of ssaiinn. considered outcasts by aann society, flinx is safe among these aliens, so safe that he is actually adopted by the tier under the name flinx llvvrxx once he proves to them he has the soul of an artist. meanwhile, back in the cities of jast, an insurrection is ongoing as a faction of vssey start a bombing campaign against the aann. based on his success in getting rid of the supposed commonwealth spy flinx, takuuna is given the assignment of tracking down this disruptive element. although he uses the best of aann intimidation and hunting techniques, his mission is a failure until a bit of luck and a low-level functionary delivers the name of the one and only terrorist. fortune also provides him with the location of flinx, the human he thought he had killed. takuuna travels to the tier to arrest flinx, but finds his efforts thwarted by the tier’s unusual imperial charter. nevertheless he manages to get special authorization to arrest one of their members and forces flinx into hiding in canyon where the artist group is creating a group project. cornered, flinx and chraluuc seek safety in a tier built shelter, but circumstances arise allowing one of takuuna’s soldiers to kill chraluuc. the shock of seeing his friend killed allows flinx to respond, instinctively, with his empathic talent, knocking out takuuna and driving the soldier permanently insane. his memory restored, flinx is able to contact teacher and leave the troubled world of jast. takuuna is airlifted from the tier, but his transport is sabotaged by the singular vssey terrorist killing him and destroying the aann authority’s transportation annex. flinx decides he has had enough of a vacation—from the commonwealth and himself—and heads back to his home territory. ||| 5 ||| 5

the story's protagonist is jud elliott iii, a failed harvard history masters student in 2059. bored with his job as a law clerk, he takes up a position with the time service as a time courier. after an introductory course, jud shunts up and down the time line ("up the line" is travel into the past; "down the line" is forward time travel, but only to "now-time," jud's present of 2059) as a guide for tourists visiting ancient and medieval byzantium/constantinople. jud's problems include not only stupid tourists, but also greedy and mentally unstable colleagues who attempt to cause various types of havoc with the past. he is forced to break the rules in order to patch things up without drawing the attention of the time patrol. when he meets and falls in love with the 'marvelous transtemporal paradox called pulcheria' - his own multi-great grandmother - jud succumbs to the lure of the past, creates irreparable paradoxes, and faces the inescapable clutches of the time patrol. silverberg's narrative includes some cleverly worked out details about the problems of time-travel tourism. for example, the number of tourists who over the years wish to witness the sermon on the mount has increased the audience at the event from the likely dozens to hundreds and even thousands. time-tour guides re-visiting the same event must also take care not to scan their surroundings too closely, lest they make eye contact with themselves leading another tour party. silverberg's interest in the byzantine era of roman history is put to use with a vivid description of constantinople during the reign of justinian, and the nika riots of 532. ||| 2 ||| 5

king arthur, the pendragon, lies dead after the battle of camlann. lin, his only child by his queen, gwenhwyfar, is one of five remaining members of the round table. civil strife has laid waste to the unified britain forged during arthur's reign. in lin's warrior persona she suppresses her gender. through years of habit, she presents an outward calm for the soldiers who have come to accept a woman's presence and command in the army. to be an effective fighting unit, they cannot be distracted by her gender either. lin tells the men of her half-brother, modred's defeat and that her father has been taken to a place of healing. beneath her stoic facade, she is torn by grief and self-doubt. she knows a mere handful of men still live who would support her claim as arthur's heir. in her mind, it is not enough. in her mind, she is unworthy to follow in her father's wake. she denies her birthright and does not return to camelot. twelve years pass in restless wandering. nightmares of camlann and of a past that she has kept hidden continue to plague her thoughts and dreams. she is now married to gaheris (ris), her father's nephew, by whom she has borne three children; bear (arthur), melora, and gernie, with a fourth child expected. her children are unaware of their mother's true identity as the pendragon's daughter. the family at last camps in the shadow of camelot. the homecoming is at once difficult and joyous. lin's secret gnaws at her mind constantly. the children are excited and curious, having heard countless tales of camelot from their uncle, dafydd. while exploring the deserted fortress of camelot, bear questions his mother and forces her to realize he is ready for the truth. yet she does not reveal this immediately. instead, lin relates her childhood as a slave in queen morgause's holding of dunn na carraice in the distant kingdom of orkney, before she learned the truth of her birth and her own royalty. once begun, the catharsis must run its course. lin's earliest memories are of sorrow and hardship. at five years old, the only mother she knows dies, leaving lin alone with dafydd, the boy she believes is her true elder brother. she hides the pain of abandonment from others and establishes her lifelong pattern of self-denial and internalization. while at work, lin often watches the royal family. she especially enjoys orkney's princes sparring in the practice yard. prince modred, the youngest, gains her sympathy when she sees the cruel jokes his older brothers play on him. she even comes to the prince's aid. modred resents anyone knowing of his weak moments. that a mere slave witnesses two of those moments is not to be tolerated or forgiven. dafydd is proud his sister displays such compassion. he feels duty-bound to take care of lin after his mother's death. during the next few years, he hones his skills as a story-teller. his tales of camelot's honor ease many of the horrors of slavery which surround him and his sister. then he receives his leather slave's collar, a coming of age "gift" from queen morgause, their mistress. their owner. the event shatters lin's fragile peace with her lot in life. questions of the established order form in lin's mind. she rejects her brother's slavery to the point of a futile attack on the overseer. she is given a small taste of the lash as a lesson. dafydd is far more accepting of their situation than lin. he finds it better to survive with as few scars as possible. lin's beating breaks his heart. he tries to dissuade her rebellion while tending her wounds later that night. for two years, he seems successful. at best, lin's calm is temporary. on lin's twelfth birthday, she is collared like so many slave before had been. she also gains prince modred as her master. the prince is now seventeen. he has recently been told by his mother that his father is the celebrated arthur pendragon and that lin is his half-sister, his father's legitimate child. she stands in his way to the throne. she is the same slave who helped him escape the outhouse his brothers had locked him inside of a few years ago. she heard his screams, she must know his fears. years of competition with his older brothers and warrior training have set the pattern of violence in modred. he has never held any sort of power in dunn na carraice. he has ultimate power over lin. lin only knows and reacts according to her instincts. the blood of kings flows through her veins. far from subduing lin—as morgause hopes—slavery brings out lin's strengths. she resists her collar, refusing to use the word "master" or bend her knees in subservience. for her open rebellion against the collar, modred has lin flogged, enjoying the sight of her pain. afterwards, he rapes her to further prove his mastery over his possession. again, dafydd cares for his sister. he does not understand her defiance. he wants her to accept reality. they are slaves and can do nothing to change that fact. one thing he does know about lin is her need for his stories about camelot. he redoubles his efforts. to lin, camelot is a beacon of hope and of equality—things dunn na carraice and her life lack. prince modred treats her like a beast, branding her as his property. he embodies the inequality she despises. each fuels the passions of the other. while outwardly continuing her resistance, the intensity of the punishments she endures take their toll on her body and her mind. lin begins to believe in her unworthiness to be loved and to love in return. she sees herself as damaged goods no husband will ever want to touch while at the same time having no desire to ever be touched by a man again. her sleep becomes tortured by nightmares and she does not eat, except when dafydd presses the issue. easily provoked by modred, she invites the beatings in the hope the next one will bring release from her suffering through death. lin's self-neglect grieves dafydd, yet he admires his sister's strength of will and the courage she displays in defying prince modred. he has come to understand that resistance is as important to lin as story-telling is to himself. he cannot dream of not weaving his tales. lin's struggle reminds dafydd, and all of orkney's slaves, of their humanity. dafydd becomes determined to keep his hero, his sister, alive. obsessed with quelling his slave's spirit, prince modred's abuses intensify. he soon includes dafydd in his tortures, since he knows lin feels dafydd's pain as her own. lin realizes there is only one cruelty prince modred has left with which to break her. it is but a matter of time before he uses it. the time is brief. but through a misunderstanding in the actual order given, lin is sent to the auction block along with her brother. she watches dafydd displayed on the block, filled with horror and utterly defeated. meanwhile, modred is unaware of his moment of triumph. lin's sale is not part of his plan. lin loses all hope when she watches dafydd disappear after being sold. in his memory, she goes to the block as defiant as ever and brings but a few coins for those who would profit from human flesh. she is taken to britain's mainland in the cargo-hold of a ship laden with other souls sharing her fate. not long after disembarking, lin discovers that dafydd had been on the ship also, as a cabin-boy. but the shadow of yet another auction looming in their future taints their joy of reunion. now on foot, the slavers' destination is the northern british city of ebrauc. unbeknownst to the slave traders, the pendragon is in residence in ebrauc when they arrive on market day. king arthur has tried to outlaw slavery in his realm, yet has been unable to stop it. performing errands, cai, seneschal and foster-brother to the pendragon, passes a pavilion with an auction in progress. curiosity leads him inside to investigate. appalled to see children for sale, he uses his authority to halt the activity and cuts away the collars from those who have not been sold. lin is among them. cai notices the lean, auburn-haired girl with the bruised face and aloof stance in the midst of the others. something about the girl draws his attention to study her more closely. recognition sparks. she bears an uncanny resemblance to the queen. cai takes lin to arthur. arthur also sees his wife's features in the child standing before him. after a long interview he has no doubt, the girl who says she came from orkney is his long-missing daughter, long-believed dead. he welcomes lin to his residence and tells her the truth of her identity.. he explains how her mother, gwenhwyfar, did not know of the serious rift between him and his half-sister, morgause. gwenhwyfar only thought to send their daughter to fosterage among kin. lin is sickened by the news that modred is her half-brother. she tells her father of the rapes and of the child she miscarried not many days before. furious with his half-sister and the boy he sired, arthur wants to avenge his innocent daughter for the abuse she endured as a slave. he is willing to leave immediately for orkney. lin has selfish reasons for stopping her father. she views slavery as a stigma and wants it to remain secret. public vengeance means exposure. she also realizes she cannot let her father fight her battles. when the time comes for her to confront modred, she knows she cannot be hiding behind her father. she must face modred alone as she has always done. ||| 2 ||| 2

a vampiric living dead girl. 2 - wine and roses ignatz returns to nana, bangkok, and is reunited with primavera. they go to a restaurant that uses gynoids to mimic the english vogue of killing lilim. the cartier automata were invented by a dr toxicophilous with robotic consciousness that harnessed 'quantum magic', and this quantum-mechanical seat of consciousness is situated in the womb of their descendents, the lilim. the pair are in the restaurant on a job from madame kito, but while primavera is engaged in assassinating one of kito's rivals ignatz is rendered unconscious. 3 - beata beatrix ignatz and primavera, now captured and rendered unconscious with a special girdle around her umbilicus, are taken by jack morgenstern to the american embassy, where they are locked up. 4 - black spring jack morgenstern reveals that the british government want primavera and ignatz returned to them, and kito has betrayed them to the americans. morgenstern questions ignatz regarding the amount of lilim escapees from the supposedly quarantined london, but gets no response to his theory that one of the surviving original cartier dolls called titania is organising the breakouts. primavera uses her quantum magic to telepathically induce her guard to release her from her umbilicus girdle, then physically smashes through the wall of her prison, allowing herself and ignatz to escape by jumping into the river below. due to the umbilical girdle primavera's quantum matrix has been infected by hostile nanobots which are inhibiting her full use of quantum magic and are slowly destroying her. primavera believes that kito has been blackmailed into betraying them. primavera and ignatz leave nana by boat. 5 - shopping and fucking ignatz apologises for running away from primavera. ignatz and primavera make love, ignatz requiring medical attention for blood loss afterwards. primavera determines to confront kito in order to be cured of the nanovirus. primavera orders new clothes for herself and ignatz made from living dermaplastic. 6 - going to a-go-go primavera and ignatz return to nana, gaining entrance to kito's penthouse in the grace hotel, only to be captured by kito and her robot guards. primavera begs kito to remove the nanovirus that is killing her. she reveals that her telepathic dreams while captured told her that kito is being blackmailed by jack morgenstern: years ago during a trade war cartier infected kito's fake dolls with an impotence std and in response kito sent her own virus to infect the genuine cartier dolls in paris - a virus that morgenstern thinks responsible for the doll plague. primavera says she can disprove this by telling kito of titania and how she and ignatz escaped england... 7 - westward ho vlad constantinescu and the human front win the british election, and the systematic execution of lilim by impalement through the umbilicus begins. primavera and ignatz decide to runaway together, and flee through the flooded london underground tunnels to hide in the west end. the pair are captured by a group of doll-killer paramedics, but are rescued by a pair of lilim. primavera and ignatz are taken to meet titania - the last of the original infected cartier dolls and queen of the lilim - at her hideout under a whitechapel warehouse. 8 - a fairy queen while telling her story primavera passes out, and kito has her resident research and development technician spalanzani examine her. the 'magic dust' virus consists of nanomachines that are transforming the ylem at the heart of her being from a quantum mechanical state to a classical mechanical state, which will render her quantum 'magic' inert. kito agrees to allow spalanzani to remove the nanomachines on the condition that ignatz continues his story... primavera and ignatz are led into the seven stars - tatiana's underground palace, where they meet tatiana and her human consort peter gunn. at tatiana's prompting, peter tells primavera and ignatz their story... 9 - the lilim peter's father (dr. toxicophilous) was a quantum engineer, a toymaker who built dolls for cartier, though with the outbreak of doll plague his services are no longer in demand. titania, his last and greatest creation, acts as a housemaid at the gunn family home. peter and titania visit the seven stars that they are constructing as a private playground and peter unlocks her matrix with his father's key, but infected with a sickness titania stays there, and cocoons herself as she begins to transform. peter's father tells him that the rumour that the doll plague was started by a rivals from the east was a lie, and that it is the result of his own dark childhood dreams subconsciously infecting the quantum structure of the dolls when he created them. 10 - unreal city jack morgenstern and the pikadon twins enter spalanzani's workshop: having bugged it morgenstern has heard the whole story. morgenstern has bought enough shares to depose kito from her company and place the pikadon twins in her place. morgenstern instructs his men to take primavera but a green light explodes from her umbilicus and morgenstern, his men, ignatz, kito and spalanzani are sucked inside primavera's quantum matrix. inside the matrix they find themselves in a dream world that is geographically a collision of london and the big weird, complete with another copy of primavera. primavera is unable to wake herself up and return them to reality, so accompanied by ignatz and morgenstern she tries to find dr toxicophilous: according to primavera toxicophilous is present in all dolls and represents the programme that controls their files - he also has the key to her matrix that can wake her up. morgenstern tries to convince primavera that he is actually working with titania, not against her. the dream city is filled with clones of primavera, with the nanovirus represented by jack the ripper-style figures. unable to find dr toxicophilous primavera realises she needs to look deeper inside herself: she gazes into her own umbilicus and is sucked through, followed by ignatz and morgentren. 11 - psychic surgery primavera, ignatz and morgenstern confront dr toxicophilous. toxicophilous tells primavera that titania had betrayed her: thanks to his subconscious corruption of titania's quantum consciousness he had created a living being with a death wish, and titania has the ability to instill this death wish in lilim at will. titania had been negotiating with morgenstern over using the lilim as instruments of us foreign policy to infect and destabilise hostile foreign countries, then cauterize the infection by use of the death wish. dr. toxicophilous gives ignatz the key to primavera's matrix, he inserts it into her umbilical and the dreamers are returned to the reality of spalanzani's workshop. spalanzani is killed when he tries to stop morgenstern shooting primavera. due to them waking up at different times kito gets a head start on her enemies and traps the pikadon twins, while morgenstern is shot and rendered unconscious. kito re-hires primavera and ignatz to work for her. 12 - desperadoes kito, primavera and ignatz find themselves on the run from the pikadon twins and jack morgenstern. kito says she can get help from a friend called mosquito. having been taken in by titania primavera and ignatz spend time at the seven stars, chaperoned by a lilim called josephene . ignatz asks for a view of england beyond that of the quarantined london and josephene shows him via the visual circuits of a shopwindow dummy in manchester, revealing a nightmare world where the human front have replaced the dolls with re-animated human corpses, 'mememoids' whose brains have been taken over by replicating information patterns transmitted via a comic strip called cruel britannia, and castrated policemen with guns as phallic replacements. following the completion of her transformation and indoctrination primavera is sent out of england to spread the doll plague through europe. together with ignatz she is led through the seven stars to a service tunnel in the channel tunnel. kito takes primavera and ignatz to meet mosquito, an old employee who she had previously used to attempt to spread her virus to the cartier dolls, to ask for money. back on the road ignatz and primavera are attacked by the pikadon twins, and though they manage to kill them they lose kito in the process. 13 - dead girls ignatz and primavera try to escape down the mekong river, but primavera collapses as she gives in to titania's death wish. a hologram of titania appears and explains to ignatz that the only way the lilim can survive is by keeping their numbers under control by culling themselves. primavera dies. ||| 5 ||| 5
anansi boys is the story of charles "fat charlie" nancy, a timid londoner devoid of ambition, whose unenthusiastic wedding preparations are disrupted when he learns of his father's death in florida. the flamboyant mr. nancy, in whose shadow fat charlie has always lived, died in a typically embarrassing manner by suffering a fatal heart attack while singing to a young woman on stage in a karaoke bar. fat charlie is forced to take time off from the accounting agency where he works and travel to florida for the funeral. after the funeral, while discussing the disposal of mr. nancy's estate, mrs. callyanne higgler, a very old family friend, reveals to fat charlie that the late mr. nancy was actually an incarnation of the west african spider god, anansi, hence his name. the reason charlie had apparently not inherited any divine powers was because they had been passed down to his hitherto unknown brother, whom she mentions can be contacted by simply asking a spider to invite him. charlie is skeptical, and on his return to england, largely forgets what mrs. higgler had told him, until one night when he drunkenly whispers to a spider that it would be nice if his brother stopped by for a visit. the next morning, the suave and well-dressed brother, going under the name of "spider", visits charlie, and is shocked to learn that their father had died. immediately spider steps through a picture to their childhood home. charlie goes off to work, rather puzzled by spider and his sudden disappearance. spider returns that night, stricken with grief that anansi had died and that he (spider) had been thoughtless enough not to notice. the two, to drown their sorrows, become uproariously drunk (at spider's recommendation) on the proverbial trio of wine, women, and song. although charlie is not involved in most of the womanizing or singing, he is drunk enough to sleep through much of the next day. spider covers for charlie's absence from his office at the grahame coats agency by magically disguising himself as charlie. in the process, spider discovers grahame coats's long-standing practice of embezzling from his clients. spider also steals the affection and virginity of charlie's fiancée, rosie noah. spider, in the guise of charlie, reveals his knowledge of the financial improprieties to grahame coats during a meeting which grahame calls in order to fire charlie. as a result, grahame delays firing charlie. when grahame seeks him next, charlie receives a large cheque and a holiday from work. with charlie out of the office, grahame coats proceeds to alter the financial records to frame charlie for the embezzlement. embittered by the loss of his fiancée, charlie uses his vacation to return to florida, and requests help from callyanne higgler and three of her equally old, eccentric friends to expel spider. being themselves powerless in this matter, they instead send him to "the beginning of the world", an abode of ancient gods similar to his father, of whom each represents a species of animal. there, he encounters the fearsome tiger, the outrageous hyena, and the ridiculous monkey, among others. none are willing to trade anything with him until he meets bird woman, who agrees to trade charlie her help, symbolized by one of her feathers, in exchange for "anansi's bloodline for my own". in london, a swindled client, maeve livingstone, confronts grahame coats directly, having learned of the embezzlement of her late husband's royalties. grahame coats agrees to make full restitution and more, suggesting that taking him to court could fail to achieve her purpose. while she is distracted by his offer, he kills her with a hammer and conceals her body in a hidden closet. charlie has returned to england, whereupon spontaneous events begin happening in quick succession. charlie quarrels and scuffles with spider; charlie is taken in for questioning by the police for financial fraud at the grahame coats agency; spider reveals the truth to rosie, who is angered by his treatment of her; birds repeatedly attack spider; grahame coats leaves england for his estate and bank accounts in the fictional caribbean island of saint andrews; and maeve livingstone's ghost begins haunting the grahame coats agency building. maeve livingstone is contacted by her late husband, who advises her to move on to the afterlife. she refuses in favor of taking vengeance on grahame coats. later, she meets the ghost of anansi himself, who recounts a story to her. once, anansi reveals, the animal god tiger owned all stories, and as a result, all stories were dark and violent; but anansi tricked tiger into surrendering the ownership of all stories to anansi, so stories now involve cleverness and skill rather than strength alone. after he is attacked by flamingoes, spider realizes that something charlie did is causing these attacks, and that he is in mortal peril. he takes charlie out of prison. they discuss matters in the course of fleeing from birds around the world, revealing that giving anansi's bloodline implicates charlie as well as spider. charlie is then returned to prison. he is eventually freed, and then mentions the hidden room in coats's office, where the police will find maeve livingstone's body. spider is swept away in a storm of birds, by which bird woman delivers spider to tiger, anansi's longtime enemy, who imprisons him and takes his tongue in order to prevent most of his use of magic. in spite of his helplessness, spider manages to form a little spider out of clay, instructing it to go find help in the spider kingdom that anansi and his descendants command. though not as effective a hunter as tiger, spider can still fend him off for a little while, whereas tiger is pleased to draw out the hunt, as it allows him to savour his long hoped-for revenge on anansi and his brood. rosie and her mother have taken a cruise to the caribbean, where they unexpectedly meet grahame coats. they have not heard of the events in england, and so unsuspectingly walk into his trap and are locked in his basement. charlie goes searching for callyanne higgler, so that she might help him answer his problems. he tries to look for her in florida, but the rest of anansi's old friends tell him mrs higgler was off in the caribbean island of saint andrews, and reveal him that it was another old lady, mrs. dunwiddy, who when fat charlie was young, made a spell to separate his good side from his bad side, which became spider, meaning that fat charlie and spider had once been one person (which explains why anansi refers to his son in the singular in american gods). he finally finds her after a long search in saint andrews and is sent again to the beginning of the world. charlie forces the bird woman to give back anansi's bloodline in return for her feather. meanwhile, spider has managed to survive, tiger having grown overconfident. when tiger attempts a killing strike, the reinforcements summoned by spider overwhelm him. at that point, charlie rescues spider and gives him back his tongue. tiger possesses grahame coats and uses his blood-lust to manipulate him, intending to get revenge on spider by killing rosie and her mother. the possession by tiger makes grahame coats vulnerable to attacks by other spirits; maeve livingstone, having found grahame coats with the aid of the ghost form of anansi, eliminates coats in the real world and, satisfied, moves on to her afterlife. at the beginning of the world, charlie, having discovered his power to alter reality by singing a story, recounts the long tale of all that has gone before, humiliating tiger to the point of retreat. spider then closes the cave entrance, sealing tiger and grahame coats into the cave; charlie weaves this event into his song, reinforcing it with his powers, such that tiger is now well and truly trapped. coats, now renamed (and in the form of a) stoat, remains with tiger as company. in the end, spider marries rosie and becomes the owner of a restaurant. he is put constantly under pressure by rosie's mother to have children, but (possibly to annoy her) never does. charlie begins a successful career as a singer, marries police officer daisy day (whom he met on the night of drinking with spider, mourning his father), and has a son. ||| 2 ||| 6
heaven leigh casteel is a fourteen year old girl living in poverty with her rather large and discontented family, in a shack in the hills of west virginia. her father, luke, is still haunted by the memory of his first wife who died giving birth to heaven and never speaks to heaven. he is rarely home and his wife, sarah, struggles to take care of heaven and her half-siblings—tom, fanny (who is very pretty and somewhat promiscuous), and keith and jane. the casteel family is looked down upon by the rest of the town, often referred to as "the hill scum". despite their poverty, heaven and tom work hard at school, with heaven hoping to become a school teacher when she is older. during this time, heaven begins to develop a relationship with a local boy, logan stonewall. meanwhile, luke spends most of his time in a local brothel, where he eventually contracts syphilis, causing sarah's next child to be born dead. heaven's grandmother passes away the same day. the stillbirth is the last straw for sarah, who had always hoped giving luke a "dark-haired boy" like himself would finally make him love her. sarah disappears, leaving a note which implies she has committed suicide. luke is nowhere to be found, so the children are left to fend for themselves. logan offers to help them, but heaven is too proud to admit that they are struggling. heaven misses a lot of school, since she now has to be mother to the family, take care of the shack and her frail, somewhat senile grandfather. whenever things look bleak, luke shows up with food to save the day, but his attempts to make money fail, and eventually, he comes up with a plan to sell his children for $500 apiece. keith and jane are first bought by a nice couple, but heaven is devastated at what is happening. shortly after, the local preacher is interested in buying heaven but luke persuades him that the younger sister, fanny, is much more suitable for his household. then a farmer comes for tom, and heaven can barely take it as tom was her closest and best friend. heaven's brothers and sisters are all sold before her, leaving her alone. it seems as though luke may actually want to keep heaven, as one night (thinking she is asleep), he comes to her and strokes her hair, muttering how soft and beautiful it is. heaven feigns sleep, and is confused as to why he is finally showing an interest. then she hears her grandfather interrupt luke, asking what he is doing in an upset voice. luke seems defensive and says heaven is his, and he can do what he wants, but luke's father tells him no, and that he needs to send heaven away. heaven does not understand or realize what luke's intentions were, and feels everyone is rejecting her now. a few days later, heaven is sold to a couple named kitty and cal dennison. kitty is controlling, obsessed with cleanliness, and though kind to heaven at times, she often seems to hate heaven and treat her like a maid. kitty's husband cal suffers from constantly being sexually teased and tormented by his wife. kitty sometimes becomes violent and beats heaven. her cruelty is later revealed to be caused by the fact that kitty once was in love with luke and almost had his child. when luke brought heaven's mother back to town, she attempted a home abortion, which went badly wrong and meant that she lost her ability to have children. because of this, kitty sees heaven both as a release for her anger towards luke, and as the daughter she was never able to have, causing kitty to be almost schizophrenic in her treatment of heaven. cal and heaven develop a close relationship as a result of their suppression, but this ultimately leads to cal pressuring heaven to have sex with him. heaven thinks this means that cal loves her. she gives in, partly because she longs for affection and partly because she feels sorry for cal over the way kitty treats him. although she is overcome with guilt and shame afterwards, the feeling of being needed by cal is so important to her that she cannot say no to him. kitty becomes sick (later revealed to be breast cancer) and the three go back to kitty and heaven's hometown of winnerrow to seek aid from kitty's family. after meeting kitty's family, especially kitty's mother, heaven begins to understand kitty's behaviour and she starts to pity her. while in her hometown, she is reunited with her siblings tom (who she has missed terribly) and fanny. fanny seems happy with the preacher and his wife, but she is also distant to heaven and seems to be avoiding her. heaven tries to avoid logan because she is afraid that he will somehow know what she has done with cal just from looking at her but her attempts are thwarted after he catches up to her and begs her to see him. she gives in and agrees to meet him the next day early in the morning. however, when she goes back to kitty's mother house, cal is waiting for her and tries to kiss her. heaven pushes him away but kitty's younger sister, maisie, sees him with his hand on heaven's breast. maisie quickly tells her family about what she saw, and it rapidly spreads through the town. the next day, after she finishes taking care of kitty, heaven goes to meet logan and they spend the day together but logan cannot keep what he heard to himself and confronts heaven. although she is actually the victim in the situation, heaven feels so guilty about her part in the 'seduction' that she does not deny it. too young to understand that this was not heaven's fault, logan feels betrayed and runs away from her. after she walks back into town, heaven goes to the hospital to find kitty awake and in a better mood. kitty then tells heaven that her father was there looking for her to apologize for everything and that he seemed like a different man. he also wanted to give her two choices: she can live with him and his new wife or try to find her mother's family and live with them, if they will accept her. unable to forgive her father for the way he treated her and for selling his other children, heaven decides to go and find her mother's family. tom tells heaven that he is going to live with luke and his new wife, as the farmer tom lives with is horrible to him and this is his chance for a better life. cal takes heaven to the airport so she can travel to her mother's family; once he gets her there, he hurries off. tom shows up with fanny, who reveals she is pregnant by the preacher and that is why she couldn't talk to or see heaven—she has to stay hidden, and the preacher and his wife are going to pretend it is their baby. she hugs heaven and tells her she loves her, then hurries back to her "home" with tom before she is discovered missing. while heaven is waiting for her plane, she reads in the newspaper that kitty has died. she thinks of how cal drove her all the way to the airport and didn't even mention kitty's death or that they were now free to live together: he wants to start a new life and she is not part of his plans. heaven is furious and hurt by his actions, thinking that after all he said about how much he loved her, he dumped her at the first opportunity, abandoning her just like luke. all she can do now is hope she finds peace and love with her mother's family. ||| 7 ||| 0
the story begins in druss's village in the drenai empire. he is a misfit and socially awkward. while he is away from the village chopping wood, a party of slavers, led by harib ka and the master swordsman collan, comes to the village and kills or enslaves everyone they find. with his dying breath, druss' father tells him to fetch the family battle-axe (snaga), which was stolen by his grandfather bardan. druss meets the hunter shadak, who is hunting the slavers to avenge the death of his son, and they join forces to pursue them. shadak succeeds in interrogating harib ka before druss kills him, and learns that rowena (who harib ka has realised has mystic powers) has been taken to the port of mashrapur. druss travels to mashrapur and meets shadak's friend sieben. together they find out that rowena will be transported to the distant land of ventria. druss attempts to break onto the ship to rescue her, but is ambushed by collan's men on the dock. druss is badly wounded but survives, and shadak reappears to kill collan. however, they fail to stop the ship from setting sail without them. when druss recovers, he and sieben (who is fleeing a jealous lover's husband) join a group of mercenaries recruited by the ventrian soldier bodasen, who is going to support the emperor gorben in a war in ventria against the neighbouring naashanites and rebels. en route, they are attacked by pirates; and during this fight sieben sees a demon materialise to defend druss and comes to the conclusion that druss is possessed. the soldiers arrive in ventria and succeed in rescuing gorben from a siege. gorben is impressed with druss and promotes him to serve in his elite bodyguard- "the immortals". sieben learns from a priest that snaga is harbouring an evil spirit, but fails to persuade druss to abandon the weapon. meanwhile, rowena has married michanek, the leading general of the naashanites. he is an honourable man and becomes concerned when she falls ill. he is told that she is suffering as a result of her mystical powers, and has these removed, along with her memory, in order to save her life. during a break in the war, druss goes travelling and loses snaga in a river. initially thinking he is free of it, he learns from the a wandering source priest that it has been found by a brutal warlord, cajivak. he and the mercenary varsava set out to recover the axe and kill cajivak, but druss is captured and imprisoned in cajivak's dungeon. at first he wastes away, but with the help of a former prisoner succeeds in regaining his strength and escaping, only to find that sieben, varsava and the archer eskodas have mounted a rescue attempt. druss kills cajivak and recovers snaga, then returns to the army. by this point in the war the naashanites are desperate and attempt to use a demon to assassinate gorben, but he is saved by druss thanks to snaga- the only weapon that seems to hurt the demon. druss also learns that rowena has married michanek and that her memory has been erased. he vows to kill michanek and reclaim rowena as his own as the army moves to besiege the last naashanite stronghold, where michanek has his home. michanek has learned of rowena's past and attempts to reconcile her to the idea of going back to druss, but she will not have it. during the siege, michanek is killed and rowena takes poison since she cannot face life alone. druss is forced to venture into the netherworld to bring her back. druss eventually succeeds in finding rowena, and despite a trick of snaga's, rescues her. in the process he banishes the demon from the axe. then he and his companions return to drenai. the epilogue deals with the events of skeln pass, a famous battle late in druss's career (by this time he is presumed to be in his mid-forties). gorben has gone mad and invades drenai, and druss and sieben go to skeln pass to meet the troops and raise morale. the ventrians launch a surprise attack, catching the drenai unprepared, and druss and sieben are caught up in the fighting. under the leadership of earl delnar, and with druss's inspirational presence, the drenai manage to hold up the ventrian advance. in a night raid, druss accidentally kills his old friend bodasen. the next day, a furious gorben, commits the immortals, who have never been defeated, to battle. in the fierce fighting the ensues, sieben is mortally wounded, but druss and the drenai manage to hold the immortals long enough for reinforcements to arrive and win the war. in the rout, gorben is killed by his own officers. during the battle, rowena, who has stayed at home with sieben's wife niobe, dies. she tells niobe that she knew she was dying but sent druss to skeln pass so that he would not have to witness it, as it would break his heart. ||| 2 ||| 2
identical twins, payton and emma mills, are complete opposites. payton is cool, fashionable, popular, caring, and optimistic, but not very book smart. where emma is extremely intelligent, goes up in many competitions, but has nearly no friends (besides payton), social or fashion smarts. everyone, except those close to them, cannot tell them apart. both twins are also embarrassed by each other, payton because emma is walking around always in hideous clothes, and emma because payton is always walking around with no intelligence. payton and emma have been going to an all girl private school up to sixth grade. they are finally going to a unisex public school, and both twins are very excited, but for different reasons. payton is excited to make new friends, see cute boys, and to be cool. emma wants to learn more, go in more competitions, and interact with people as intelligent as she is. on the first day of school, both twins realize that they have no classes together. at first they are upset, but then realize it won't be so bad. they will finally have their own identities. prior to the story, over the summer, payton spent all of summer at camp working for a wealthy girl, ashlynn, for her cool clothes. she believes they will help her fit in better. she wears them every day for the first few days of school. in homeroom, payton meets the most popular girl in school, sydney fish. they immediately strike up friendship, though payton is worried that sydney won't like her because she isn't cool enough. at lunch, though, sydney invites payton to sit with her and her friends, cashmere, quinn, and priya. emma, on the other hand, is not in the front row, center seat, as usual. that spot is taken by another extremely intelligent girl jazmine james. emma hopes she and jazmine will become friends, so she can finally have an intellectual conversation with someone. jazmine, however, turns out to be very snobby and mean. jazmine also has two also very intelligent sidekicks, hector and tess. after the first day of school, their parents take them out to eat at a chinese restaurant, as a family tradition. they each receive presents from their parents, an iphone from their mother, and two matching bracelets with the first letter of their first name on them. payton is doing wonderful with her social life, and loves school. emma, on the other hand, isn't getting a good reputation with her teachers, unlike usual, where teachers love her. one day, payton makes a fatal mistake, which ends up with sydney being mad at her, after payton yelled at sydney and spilled her lunch all over the most popular guy in school, ox. emma tells payton to switch places, so they do. while switching places, emma, as payton, redeems herself so sydney won't be mad at payton anymore.

guardian in training rosemarie "rose" hathaway and moroi princess vasilisa "lissa" dragomir are brought back to their school, st. vladimir's academy, after running away two years previously. on returning, guardian dimitri belikov, who was the leader of the team of guardians sent to retrieve the two, is assigned to be lissa's guardian. he offers to mentor rose in her guardian training as he feels she has potential and with training can make up for the years she has lost. he also believes rose can be an excellent guardian to lissa due to the presence of a rare one-sided psychic bond to lissa which allows her to know the latter's emotions, thoughts, and whereabouts. rose agrees, knowing this is the only way she will be allowed to remain, and on graduation be lissa's guardian. though they soon fall into the academy life, they find that lissa has lost her social standing among the other moroi royals owing to her running away. they decide to keep company with lissa's "cousin" natalie dashkov, who is the daughter of sick and dying victor dashkov. on the very first day back they find that another moroi student, mia rinaldi, who is dating lissa's ex-boyfriend aaron, holds a grudge against lissa (and by default rose). mia finds every opportunity to insult lissa and is in turn insulted and threatened by rose. lissa finds a friend, christian ozera, much to the ire of the ever protective rose. christian's parents had turned strigoi (undead vampires) of their own will for immortality and had been killed by guardians. rose mistrusts christian because of his family history. it is also implied that she is jealous of lissa's interest in him. rose, in turn, starts falling for dimitri. things start getting worse when lissa finds dead animals in her room along with threatening letters. lissa starts going into depression and engages in self mutilation. it is revealed that though she has not specialized in any elemental magic (air, water, fire, and earth), she has a miraculous ability to heal, which was witnessed by rose and their teacher ms. karp two years back. rose finds out that this gift is shared by ms. karp, who is then taken to a mental institution. they find out that lissa has affinity for spirit, that might just be dangerous for her and rose. this incident along with her increasing depression was what had caused rose to run away with lissa. while attending sunday service, rose hears that the moroi saint st. vladimir could heal people, and suffered from some form of depression. also, he was protected by his loyal companion the "shadow kissed" anna with whom he shared a bond. on returning from a shopping trip with lissa, victor, and natalie, rose has an accident and on waking up deduces from what dimitri tells her (that she had a miraculous recovery) that lissa had healed her. she reaches into her bond and finds that lissa is lying on the attic of the church bleeding from self-inflicted cuts. her reporting this incident causes a slight break in their friendship. somehow discovering this, mia insults lissa, calling her unstable, causing rose to punch mia and break her nose. detained by teachers and guardians, rose is unable to follow lissa; she reaches through her bond while confined to her room and finds that lissa is being kidnapped by some guardians who assault christian when he tries to save her. rose tries to go and warn dimitri and instead ends up nearly having sex with him. they stop when dimitri unclasps a locket gifted by victor from her neck and he manages to throw it away. it is later revealed that victor had charmed the locket with a lust charm which causes people to act on already existing attraction, letting go of inhibitions. through the bond rose finds out that victor is the one who kidnapped lissa and plans to use her to heal his genetic disease. he reveals that natalie was the one who left the animals in lissa's room to see her heal them after accidentally catching her doing so. he also reveals that lissa had specialized in the rare fifth element spirit, and that her bringing back rose from the dead after the accident was what caused them to have a bond. using spirit is what was causing lissa's depression. though lissa heals victor for the time being, the school guardians are able to reach the place and rescue her. on returning, victor convinces natalie to turn strigoi by killing while feeding and gets her to break him free. she injures rose who was visiting victor, but is killed by dimitri. dimitri reveals that he too feels for rose but cannot have a relationship with her because of their age difference and because he won't be able to guard lissa wholeheartedly if she is near him. ||| 2 ||| 2
the story begins with the monk tensing and his disciple, the prince dil bahadur, traveling in a remote part of the himalaya, on a journey to the valley of the yeti, in search of rare plants found only there, for use in medicines and balms. when they arrive they find the valley is beautiful, and they stay the night. in the morning they awake to many yetis around them with clubs and other weapons, yet the monk and his disciple remain calm but then in the distance they see a slow moving, bigger yeti, the ancient matriarch of the yeti, grr-ympr. she calls off the warriors, and soon the lamas learn the sad story of the last of the yeti. grr-ympr is very old, from a stronger generation of yetis, but with each generation of yeti, they grow smaller, weaker and animalistic, in contrast to the great human-like yeti of the past, whose society was nearly as complex as that of the humans. they believed this was due to the wrath of the gods, and that the lamas were the gods themselves, arriving to save the yeti. after observing the yeti, they find that the yeti breastfeed their young, but as it gives little nourishment, the milk does not strengthen the babies, which is why they are all so sickly and weak, and often die. further investigation also shows all the yeti have purple, diseased tongues, which seems to be a sign of something in their environment weakening them. the lamas teach the yeti to milk the chegnos, the only domesticated animal the yeti have, to feed the milk to the babies, who then show improvement from the diet. they also soon discover the water from the thermal springs that the yeti drink from is contaminated with toxic minerals, and is the cause of the weakness of the yeti and their purple tongues. after the tribe ceases to drink from the springs, their energy and health rapidly improves, and in return for what the lamas have done, they help them collect the plants and show them a short cut tunnel that cuts the journey back a great deal. the novel then shifts to kate cold, a writer for international geographic, and her grandson alexander cold, arriving back in the new york from their adventures in brazil from the previous novel. alexander gives his grandmother three large diamonds that nadia had found in the amazon, and tells her to use them to fund an organization to protect the people of the mist, and other indians in south america. although initially doubtful to the large eggs being diamonds, kate goes to her jeweler friend isaac rosenblat, who immediately tells her that they are the largest diamonds he has ever seen and worth a fortune. the scene shifts six months and in that time the diamond foundation has been started, along with the help of kate's old nemesis, archaeologist ludovic leblanc. kate has also been assigned by international geographic to travel to the kingdom of the golden dragon to write an article. a call from alexander asking to be able to come along and bring nadia convinces her to have them come as well. the scene shifts to the second richest man in the world, known as the collector, talking with the specialist, talking about acquiring the golden dragon, an artifact from the kingdom of the golden dragon which allows people to see into the future, as well as instructions on how to use it. the collector seeks this item to be able to foresee the stock market, and to use it to make himself much richer, and no longer be the second richest man in the world. once at kingdom of the golden dragon as it's called, they get involved in a sinister plot to kidnap young girls and force them to be their slaves. nadia who is mistaken as a girl from the kingdom is kidnapped along with pema and a few other girls. now it is up to alexander and his annoyed grandmother to save the girls along with a little help from the country's forces, a lama, his disciple, and of course boroba's keen senses to find nadia. ||| 7 ||| 2
the story is narrated by a young rich man, heir to a huge sum of money. he devotes his life to an organization called "we live again" which investigates the reality of reincarnation. people have souls that pass on to other individuals and give them their memories, usually alongside, but sometimes in place of their own memories. the story focuses on mallory gabus, a recently reincarnated woman and her fascinating integration into the new world. she recalls and narrates her experiences and memories of hitler's victory, which allowed hitler to bring his desire for an "aryan" world to fruition. she realizes all that went wrong. the nazis had won world war ii and purged their empire of all non-whites, then rewrote history so as to say that dachau, a concentration camp, was instead a battle with adolf hitler as its hero. after hitler's victory, the third reich is solely aryan, the aryans have killed all non-aryans in their new empire. they now use a.d. to refer to after dachau, the turning point in their civilization, and a.d.-a.d. to refer to our a.d. mallory was (re-)born in 1922 a.d.-a.d. as an afro-american female in new york. we find out that the nazi purges in the third reich have started to have a cultural effect on america, and soon jews are being executed. blacks are being "repatriated", which turns out to mean: put into concentration camps. mallory, hides out with her lover in the n.y. underground and makes a life until their hiding place is discovered by police. at that point, they commit suicide rather than being taken alive or executed. the narrator, in an attempt to publicize the story and the atrocities the aryans committed, contacts a newspaper and other news media. his investigation gets him sequestered in an unknown location until he can write three words upon a chalkboard. the words turn out to be "no one cares", and, as it turns out, no one does. the narrator explains that he cares, and he doesn't care if others don't care, he is still going to pursue this for his own personal interest. he opens an exhibit displaying relics from the old world, including works by jewish authors such as albert einstein and sigmund freud. the narrator receives a gift from his "uncle" (the man who imprisoned him), and expresses his intent to publish the gift. he opens a shop where he displays pictures of africans that had been saved in mallory's hideout. finally, one night, someone throws a brick through the gallery's windows, prompting the narrator to conclude that somebody "does care". the last line reveals that the gift is the diary of a young girl written during world war ii, the diary of anne frank. ||| 6 ||| 0
anne shirley has now been married to gilbert blythe for 15 years, and the couple have six children: jem, walter, nan, di, shirley, and rilla. after a holiday in europe, anne returns to the news that a new minister has arrived in glen st. mary. john meredith is a widower with four young children: jerry, faith, una, and carl. the children have not been properly brought up since the death of their mother, with only their absent-minded father (who is easily absorbed by matters of theology) and their old, bitter, and partially deaf aunt martha to take care of them. the children are considered wild and mischievous by many of the families in the village (who tend only to hear about the meredith children when they have gotten into some kind of scrape), causing them to question mr. meredith's parenting skills and his suitability as a minister. for most of the book, only the blythes know of the meredith children's loyalty and kindness. they rescue an orphaned girl, mary vance, from starvation, and una finds a home for her with mrs. marshall elliot. when the children get into trouble, faith sometimes tries to explain their behavior to the townsfolk, which generally causes an even bigger scandal. the merediths, blythes, and mary vance often play in a hollow called rainbow valley, which becomes a gathering place for the children in the book. jem blythe tries to help the merediths behave better by forming the "good-conduct club", in which the merediths punish themselves for misdeeds. their self-imposed punishments lead to carl becoming very ill with pneumonia after spending hours in a graveyard on a wet night, and to una fainting in church after fasting all day. when this happens, john meredith is wracked with guilt over his failings as a father. mr. meredith realizes that he should marry again and give the children a mother, though he has always thought he will never love anyone again as he did his late wife. he is surprised to find that he has fallen in love with rosemary west, a woman in her late thirties who lives with her sister ellen, who is ten years older. john proposes marriage to rosemary, but ellen forbids rosemary to accept, as years earlier they had promised each other never to leave the other following the deaths of their parents. however, ellen eventually reunites with her childhood beau, norman douglas, and asks rosemary to release her from her promise so she can marry norman. rosemary agrees, but now thinks that john meredith hates her. una overhears her father expressing feelings for rosemary and goes to ask rosemary to marry her father despite her misgivings about stepmothers, who mary vance has told her are always mean. rosemary sets her mind at ease and agrees to speak to john meredith again. they become engaged, and rosemary and ellen plan a double wedding in the fall. ||| 0 ||| 0

dewey sought to at once synthesize, criticize, and expand upon the democratic (or proto-democratic) educational philosophies of jean-jacques rousseau and plato. he saw rousseau's philosophy as overemphasizing the individual and plato's philosophy as overemphasizing the society in which the individual lived. for dewey, this distinction was largely a false one; like vygotsky, he viewed the mind and its formation as a communal process. thus the individual is only a meaningful concept when regarded as an inextricable part of his or her society, and the society has no meaning apart from its realization in the lives of its individual members. however, as evidenced in his later experience and nature (1925), this practical element—learning by doing—arose from his subscription to the philosophical school of pragmatism. ||| 4 ||| 4

ryn syndicate, and they make their escape. two of the bith are killed by the pursuing yuuzhan vong forces while one of them is captured, but thorsh escapes selvaris thanks to the millennium falcon. the surviving bith is interrogated by the camp's head, malik carr, and the bith reveals the mathematical code, unknowing of what it actually means. the bith is killed as a result. the millennium falcon brings thorsh back to the galactic alliance where he is debriefed and recites the mathematical code to a givin member of the alliance. the code reveals that selvaris will be the last pickup point for a yuuzhan vong-peace brigade convoy that will be taken to yuuzhan'tar (vongformed coruscant) for a grand sacrifice. so an alliance fleet ambushes selvaris and rescues many prisoners, although some manage to get away. however, the millennium falcon, badly damaged from the battle, is forced to make an erratic jump into hyperspace that transports it to caluula. as it turns out, the inhabitants of the caluula system have been fending off the vong for quite some time now, but they are able to repair the falcon. some of the prisoners leave the falcons company in order to help the residents of caluula continue to fight the yuuzhan vong while the falcon returns to the alliance with what prisoners they have left. as zonama sekot travels through hyperspace back to known space, it turns out that harrar survived his confrontation with the treacherous nom anor in the previous novel. and through him, he and the residents of the living world discover that the yuuzhan vong exist outside the force because they had been stripped of it, most likely by their homeworld of the original yuuzhan'tar back in the vong's home galaxy. on yuuzhan'tar, things are not going well for shimrra's order. even with all of the advancements they made in the war against the galactic alliance, problems continue to plague the yuuzhan vong's capital planet thanks to the world brain, and the heresy espoused by the shamed ones is still as strong as ever, even without nom anor's leadership. nom anor himself has been inducted back into the elite as prefect of yuuzhan'tar thanks to his actions on zonama sekot, but even he can't quell the fire that he sparked in the shamed ones as yu'shaa, their prophet. as for the sacrifice that had been partially foiled thanks to the battle of selvaris, the yuuzhan vong are able to compensate with captives from other contested worlds following selvaris. but the sacrifice is spoiled thanks to a riot caused by the shamed ones, who save many of the galactic alliance captives much to their own detriment as shimrra has many shamed ones and workers executed as capital punishment. nevertheless, despite the thwarting of the sacrifice, shimrra gives warmaster nas choka the go-ahead to prepare his fleet to invade the galactic alliance's capital of mon calamari. as the yuuzhan vong arrive at mon calamari and battle the opposing galactic alliance forces, han and leia organa solo, along with a few allies, infiltrate the vong-captured caluula in order to eliminate the resident yammosk there. though they are captured with two of their allies killed, they find that the local yuuzhan vong and their biots are dying, along with many of caluula's indigenous creatures. after many of the yuuzhan vong, their biots, and caluula's own creatures die off, one craft made for shimrra's new special slayer warriors manages to make it off caluula and it heads back to yuuzhan'tar in order to inform the elite of this new affliction. as kyp durron, part of the infiltration team, is able to discern, the illness that the yuuzhan vong on caluula are suffering is alpha red, a biological virus set to target and eliminate the yuuzhan vong and anything sharing their dna with them. it had been deployed on caluula in secret just before the planet surrendered to the invaders. just before it seems that nas choka's forces would win at the battle of mon calamari, they suddenly make a hasty retreat back to yuuzhan'tar, where zonama sekot has appeared in the capital planet's skies, causing various disasters and eliciting more opposition from the heretics. with the living world offering a distraction to the yuuzhan vong, the jedi and the galactic alliance gather up all of their forces and resources for one last showdown against the vong. after the alliance successfully captures the vong-occupied world of corulag as their staging position, they travel to the captured coruscant, and the battle of yuuzhan'tar, the final battle of the yuuzhan vong war, begins. on the ground, nom anor decides to forsake shimrra's order, seeing how deranged he has become as a result of zonama sekot's arrival, and realigns himself with the shamed ones against those who are still loyal to shimrra. the heretics are soon reinforced by galactic alliance soldiers who managed to get past the yuuzhan vong's space defenses as the space fleets of both the alliance and the vong duel over the contested planetary capital of the galaxy and the world of muscave. meanwhile, nas choka takes a portion of his fleet to destroy zonama sekot using the alpha red-infected slayer ship, as shimrra revealed previously that there is indeed a biological connection between the vong and zonama. defending the living world are the majority of the new jedi order, the smugglers' alliance, and the fleet of the hapes consortium. on yuuzhan'tar, luke skywalker, his wife mara, jaina and jacen solo, tahiri veila, and kenth hamner all join up with captain judder page's commandos in order to storm shimrra's citadel and kill the supreme overlord, ending the yuuzhan vong war once and for all. however, mara, tahiri, and hamner all join a division of page's commandos to help the heretics against shimrra's loyal warriors, and it gives mara an opportunity to confront nom anor, despite the fact that he is leading the heretics, for all he did to her, her family, and her friends and allies in the past. after mara gives him a severe beating, nom anor pleads for his life, which mara grudgingly spares so that he would be properly convicted for his crimes in the end. meanwhile, the millennium falcon goes on a mission with harrar to convince the world brain to cease its destruction of yuuzhan'tar, which was intended by shimrra to completely destroy the world so no one could have it, just to spite the galactic alliance. with the help of nom anor and his shamed ones and other allies, including turncoat vong warriors, the crew of the falcon, and harrar, avert death from the yuuzhan vong sent to protect the world brain. then the falcons crew and harrar make it to the dhuryam and they try to coerce master shaper qelah kwaad into convincing the brain to cease its destructive activities before they consider killing it. in the end, though, jacen telepathically tells the world brain to ignore shimrra's commands, which stops yuuzhan'tar's apocalypse. as page and his remaining commandos storm the lower levels of shimrra's citadel, luke, jaina, and jacen, after killing and wounding every yuuzhan vong warrior in their path, eventually confront shimrra and his fifteen special slayer guards inside shimrra's private coffer at the top of the citadel. the three jedi are able to kill all of the slayers whilst jaina follows shimrra's shamed companion, onimi, to the control level of shimrra's coffer. there, onimi easily overpowers jaina and renders her unconscious with a toxin from his fang. jaina notes, as she falls unconscious, that she was able to sense onimi through the force. meanwhile, with all of his slayers dead, shimrra fights luke and traps him with his royal amphistaff, the scepter of power, before taking out the late anakin solo's lightsaber as a mind game to luke; shimrra wants luke to know what it feels like to fight something that is part of his order, just as the yuuzhan vong have to fight zonama sekot, something that shimrra believes should have been part of the vong's order due to its living nature. though luke is poisoned by the scepter of power, he is able to take anakin's lightsaber from shimrra's grasp and he uses both his own and his late nephew's weapons to decapitate shimrra. with jacen's own lightsaber lost in the conflict, luke throws him anakin's lightsaber, which jacen misses, and sees it fly away, echoing the vision he had on duro three years earlier, and again on zonama sekot before the battle of yuuzhan'tar began. regardless, jacen goes up to the control level of shimrra's coffer in order to collect jaina. as onimi readies shimrra's coffer to launch into space, an awakened but still weakened jaina is told by the shamed one, who believes that she is the human avatar of the vong trickster goddess yun-harla, that he had attained his force powers by grafting yammosk dna to his own neural tissue in order to emulate the gods' works in creating the universe. this was done after onimi, being a shaper at the time, discovered that there was no eighth cortex in the shaper qahsa. although he was shamed as a result, he was able to use his powers to not only concoct deadly toxins that he could control in his body, but he also manipulated shimrra into convincing the rest of the yuuzhan vong into invading the galaxy; therefore, throughout shimrra's reign, it was onimi who had really been controlling the yuuzhan vong as its true supreme overlord. with shimrra now dead, he plans to kill everyone and every living thing in the galaxy so that he could become a new god and fashion a new universe in his image. as the alliance and their yuuzhan vong allies take hold of shimrra's citadel, luke is carried away, and han and leia follow nom anor's lead in order to find jaina and jacen at the control level of the supreme overlord's coffer. as they do that, the coffer launches for space, and the millennium falcon, piloted by mara jade skywalker with an ailing luke aboard, and jagged fel in his commandeered x-wing follow the coffer. meanwhile, as word of shimrra's death spreads, nas choka and his forces refuse to believe it, especially after his coffer appears rising up from yuuzhan'tar. in the coffer, however, jacen confronts onimi and then hears the voice of his late grandfather, anakin skywalker, telling him to "stand firm," like he did on duro. so as jacen fights onimi, he manages to achieve oneness with the force, knowing that he'll never achieve this state again while simultaneously knowing that he'll spend the rest of his life trying to do so. as a result, jacen defeats supreme overlord onimi. han, leia, and nom anor arrive just in time to watch jacen's amazing victory as he appears to age five years. onimi, meanwhile, is reverted of his shamed deformities, but because his deformities were the result of his gaining the force, he loses control of the toxins in his body and dies, melting into a puddle of foul hydrocarbons that is absorbed by the coffer's yorik coral floor like a stain. the coffer begins to die off due its now-lost connection with onimi, and nom anor tries to trick the solos into going into a garbage chute while he escapes alive. with his vongsense, jacen thwarts his plan, and when nom anor tries one more time to evade the solos, his hand is cut off by leia via her lightsaber. nevertheless, nom anor opens up the entry into the coffer's yorik-trema (landing craft) and simply allows the solos to leave without him; due to his atheism, which makes him undesirable in the yuuzhan vong's society, and his contempt for the force, which makes him undesirable in the galactic alliance's society, nom anor elects to die aboard the coffer, despite his earlier vows of surviving the war. the coffer's explosion is viewed by warmaster nas choka and his fleet. he announces to all of his forces that the war is over and that the yuuzhan vong's enemies have won. he offers them an ultimatum; those who wish to die may kill themselves or fight to the bitter end, while those like him will live to find out what the galactic alliance and their allies intend to do to them. meanwhile, zonama sekot manages to repel the alpha red-infected vong ship from its surface and brings down all ships, yuuzhan vong and non-vong alike, to the ground. the vong's weapons become docile and harmless as the invaders are welcomed home. aboard the millennium falcon, the solos are saved from the dying yorik-trema, and jacen is able to use mara's tears and his own to concoct a chemical, as the late vergere has done, to cure luke of shimrra's amphistaff poison. it works, and the skywalkers and solos collapse into one big embrace, glad that they survived and that the war is over. c-3po and r2-d2 watch this scene and lament how at times like these, they envy how humans must feel. following the yuuzhan vong war's end, with most of the peace brigade dead and/or disbanded, nas choka meets with the galactic alliance's leaders to come to terms with how they should find a long-lasting solution to the war. choka agrees to collect all remaining vong throughout the galaxy so that they will be deposited on zonama sekot and be taken away into the unknown regions, where they will be safe and learn to acclimate their culture to peace and also reclaim their connection to the force. to counter those who wish to see the yuuzhan vong totally exterminated, such as the bothans among others, galactic alliance chief of state cal omas saw to it that each and every remaining sample of alpha red has been destroyed. meanwhile, zonama sekot discovers that it is the offspring of the original yuuzhan'tar, thus explaining the biological connection that it has with the yuuzhan vong. amidst all of this, luke declares that the jedi shouldn't be the police force of the galaxy like it once was, and that the order should allow individuals to find their own way in serving the galaxy, and, more importantly, themselves and the force. jacen, for one, plans to go on a galactic sojourn so that he could broaden his view of the force following his battle with onimi. several weeks later, after nearly every remaining yuuzhan vong is collected, zonama sekot travels back into the unknown regions. later, the skywalkers, the solos, and their friends and allies revisit kashyyyk, where han pinions anakin's lightsaber into chewbacca's makeshift grave. luke declares that should the need ever arise again, someone as virtuous as chewbacca will pick up anakin's lightsaber and conquer whatever threat that will endanger the galaxy in the future. afterwards, they all have a feast where they discuss their vacation plans. han convinces lumpawaroo and lowbacca not to carry on chewbacca's life debt by saying that he and leia already convinced their noghri bodyguards, cakhmaim and meewalh, to take a vacation for themselves. the novel, and the series, ends with everybody laughing, not only at what han said, but also in joy and relief that once again, the galaxy is at peace. ||| 5 ||| 5
the story begins when the two aviators meet professor pennyroyal aboard airhaven, who persuades them to take him as a passenger. they are soon pursued by airships of the green storm, (a fanatical splinter group of the anti-traction league) and drift helplessly over the ice wastes. however, they are fortunate enough to be rescued by anchorage, once a thriving traction city that relied primarily upon trade, but which has now been devastated by an excavated biological weapon that killed nearly all of the population. the city is now ruled by freya rasmussen, the young margravine who was suddenly thrust into power after her parents died from the plague. the people of the city are desperate for sanctuary and have set a course for north america, which has been a radioactive wasteland since the events of the sixty minute war. freya, however, is convinced that they will find a land of lush greenery, which pennyroyal claims to have seen on a voyage to the dead continent many years ago. she is delighted to find that the professor is onboard her city and treats all three of them as honoured guests. pennyroyal, however, is less than pleased to hear that anchorage is making for america. tom and hester set about repairing the jenny haniver, though tom finds that he enjoys anchorage. hester, on the other hand, is jealous of his growing closeness with freya, and disturbed by the sightings of "ghosts" in the city. eventually she sees tom kissing freya, and flies away from the city in the jenny haniver, heartbroken. hester intends to sell anchorage's course to the predator city of arkangel, with the deal that when the city eats anchorage, tom will be returned to her. she makes this deal with piotr masgard, the leader of arkangel's "huntsmen" - armed warriors who capture cities by airship and then order them into arkangel's jaws. returning to the jenny haniver, however, she is drugged and kidnapped by a green storm informant. hester is taken to rogue's roost, an island south of greenland. the green storm have converted it into a base, where she discovers that they have stolen anna fang's body and have turned her into a stalker. they hope to return the stalker's memories by showing her hester. they also tell her that, according to their intelligence, hester's father was actually thaddeus valentine. hester finds this upsetting, and she also grieves for her loss of tom. tom has been lamenting the loss of hester and regretting kissing freya. he and pennyroyal are now stranded on anchorage, as the jenny haniver was the only airship on the city. he is also shocked when pennyroyal miserably confesses that he is a fraud - he never actually went to america, and based his entire book off an old explorer's map in the reykjavík library, which was stolen many years ago. in despair, tom makes another shocking discovery: the "ghosts" who have been sighted around the city are actually thieves, operating out of a parasite submarine attached to the bottom of the city. they call themselves lost boys and work out of a larger group in the secret underwater city of grimsby. with their secret blown, they kidnap tom and leave the city, taking him back to grimsby. tom develops a sort of friendship with the boy caul on their trip back to grimsby. caul tells him that the city is ruled by "uncle", a man who founded it long ago as a base of thieves. the lost boys use limpet submarines to attach themselves to raft-cities and ice-cities, robbing the inhabitants. when they arrive in grimsby tom is taken to see uncle, who tells him there is something valuable in rogue's roost, which he wants tom to steal for him. in return tom will have the chance to rescue hester. tom agrees and caul takes him to the roost. he climbs a ladder up the rocky cliffs to infiltrate the base but is soon discovered. this was the lost boys' plan all along, it is revealed - they were merely using tom as a decoy to mount their own infiltration. caul, however, does not want to see tom die, so he blows up the charges the lost boys had planted prematurely, risking their operation but saving tom and hester. in the confusion the lost boys make their way to the chamber where the stalker fang is kept. this is apparently what uncle wanted to steal, as she betrayed him when they were young and he now wants revenge by making her his slave. the stalker easily kills the lost boys however, with only caul and a few others escaping in a limpet. it pursues tom and hester into a hangar where the jenny haniver is kept, but before it kills them it suddenly remembers their faces. the stalker lets them escape, and then takes command of the green storm forces. in grimsby, caul has slowly been left to die by hanging for betraying the lost boys at rogue's roost. another lost boy, gargle, saves him, however, giving him the reykjavik map of america's green places (it was actually stolen by the lost boys), and telling him to steal a limpet and head for anchorage. in anchorage, which is now west of greenland, arkangel is catching up to the city and the huntsmen have been dispatched. they easily overpower anchorage and leave it helpless on the ice, but with a day to go before arkangel arrives tom and hester make it back to the city, finding it eerily deserted. they discover pennyroyal is the only one who has escaped notice by the huntsmen. hester sends tom to hide in safety, intending to kill the huntsmen herself. she tells pennyroyal to run out and make a diversion. when he refuses out of fear, she confides in him that it was she who sent arkangel after anchorage. terrified by her ruthlessness, he runs out and is spotted by the huntsmen. she uses the distraction to kill those by their airship, and then heads up to the palace where the city's populace are being kept. tom sees pennyroyal running off, and chases him. hester liberates the palace and kills the last of the huntsmen, while tom confronts pennyroyal, who is attempting to fly off in the jenny haniver. attempting to scare tom off, pennyroyal accidentally shoots tom in the chest. he then steals the airship, and escapes. arkangel is still pursuing anchorage, but accidentally heads over thin ice and is trapped. anchorage escapes on an ice floe, but with the revelation that pennyroyal is a fraud they have lost hope in the salvation of their city waiting in america. caul then arrives with the reykjavik map, and convinces them to keep going. tom has been badly injured by penntroyal's gun, as the bullet went right next to his heart, however, no-one can help him as there is no doctor aboard anchorage. pennyroyal makes it back to the safety of the hunting ground, and soon publishes a book retelling the events of anchorage's flight west, casting himself as the hero. arkangel is evacuated and eventually sinks to the bottom of the ocean as the ice thaws in summer. in asia, the green storm topples the old anti-traction league under the leadership of the stalker fang, setting up events for the war that takes place in the following books. anchorage eventually makes it to north america, and finds it verdant and lush. tom has survived his bullet wound, but is still very weak. hester reflects that the city will be secret and safe in this new land, and is pleased to discover that she is pregnant. ||| 7 ||| 2
the story opens with the introduction of a brother and a sister: wraith and raven. both of whom are of considerable maturity for their age, raven being only 15 and very independent. she is a hex, whereas wraith is not. the two are meeting up after three days of separation from arriving in england. it is presumed that formerly they were in the united states because there is a reference to denver. raven and wraith had to grow up fast, being orphans in a blockhouse from which they escaped. wraith got out first by joining a gang and raven later on, becoming a hired computer hacker. the two are able to travel so easily because raven is able to hack many systems and can create fake bank accounts, identification cards, and profiles of people. while the siblings escaped living in the blockhouses, their younger sister rachel was adopted. the two haven't heard from her in years, and wraith is determined to find out where she is located. entering the slums of london, wraith mets a boy by the name of kez who is dirty, homeless, and knows the streets. he helps wraith find the countess, a woman who mans a headquarters (or fortress) responsible for locating people, providing weapons, muscle, and information for a price. kez tags along with wraith to a hotel, where raven meets up with the two of them. the next morning, raven decides to dive into the net searching for information about her sister rachel. during the search, she runs into another hex, who is completely inexperienced. raven discovers everything about the other hex, who is a sixteen year old girl by the name of ali. a rich and spoiled daughter of a man who owns vidchannels. kez, wraith, and raven move to the belgravia complex, the same rich neighborhood that ali lives in, partly because raven has high taste. the first day involves kez exploring the area on his own and running into ali's clique by accident. earlier, raven had spoken to him about 20th century music and the information comes in handy as he tries to hold his own in a conversation with the very spoiled girls. ali then tells her father about how kez's "cousin" (raven) owns a vidchannel and can perhaps help him with one of his failing channels. over the course of the novel, wraith discovers that rachel had been taken from her adopted parents by the cps. raven, collaborating with ali's father on a vidchannel to bring its failing ratings up, is invited to a party in which she meets ali, who somehow feels terrified at seeing raven because she inexplicably knows it is the same girl she ran into in the net. wraith becomes discouraged at the news of rachel's disappearance but regains hope when raven hacks various systems and reports that she thinks rachel might still be alive. in an attempt to successfully break into the cps facility that holds hexes and possibly rachel, wraith tries to convince ali to be caught and taken there. she refuses. at which point, raven and kez devise a plan to lie to wraith and ali and say that the cps is already on their way to get her. by coincidence, the cps comes and takes ali away and she is transported to the cps facility. prior to that, raven had told her in the presence of wraith and kez that she was getting taken and had implanted a communication device behind her ear. suiting up for the raid, wraith contacts the countess for muscle. three soldier-like "gangers" are assigned to the mission by the name of melek, finn, and jeeva. ali has, in the mean time, befriended some fellow inmates and discovers the experimenting on these 'test subjects' is going on. she asks to see the remaining hexes that did survive and luciel, a boy she befriends, takes her to see revenge. raven tells ali to speak in such a way to see if it is rachel or not, because the girl is clearly insane. it turns out to be rachel but the girl now calls herself revenge because of her intent. many violent gun fights ensue as the small group makes its way to the main room computer room so raven can gain control over the facility. becoming aware of what is happening, the main scientist in charge of the experiments, dr. kalden is determined to stop the group and is intrigued at the idea of experimenting on raven. one of the gangers (melek) dies when wraith finds revenge as the cps guards open fire on them. barely escaping, raven, wraith, kez, finn, jeeva, ali and her friend luciel make it to the roof of the facility. before leaving, raven sends out images of the experiments going on to vidchannels across england. in an attempt to cover up the evidence, the scientists blow up the building and escape also. the book ends with raven and wraith, as well as the rest of the group watching the government broadcast news that the facility and the experiments shown from raven's broadcasts never happened. the prime minister then states that raven's group were terrorists responsible for the damages and deaths, and that they will be caught. the group as a whole decide that they should stick together and fight the tyranny of the government as well as the belief that hexes are mutants that should be killed. ||| 7 ||| 7

gould's thesis in wonderful life was that chance was one of the decisive factors in the evolution of life on earth. he based this argument on the wonderfully preserved fossil fauna of the burgess shale, animals from around 505 million years ago, just after the cambrian explosion. gould argued that although the burgess animals were all exquisitely adapted to their environment, most of them left no modern descendants and, more importantly, that the surviving creatures did not seem better adapted than their now extinct contemporaneous neighbors. he proposed that given a chance to "rewind the universe" and flip the coin of natural selection again, we might find ourselves living in a world populated by descendants of hallucigenia rather than pikaia. this seems to indicate that fitness for existing conditions does not ensure long-term survival, especially when conditions change rapidly, and that the survival of many species depends more on chance events and features, which gould terms exaptations, fortuitously beneficial under future conditions than on features best adapted under the present environment (see also extinction event). he regarded opabinia as so important to understanding the cambrian explosion that he wanted to call his book homage to opabinia. ||| 4 ||| 4

﻿fortune favors justin alastair, the uncanny and notorious duke of avon, casting in his way, one paris night, the means to revenge himself on his enemy, the comte de saint-vire. avon literally collides with an abused boy, léon bonnard, whose red hair, deep blue eyes and (improbably) black eyebrows proclaim him a child of the comte. ﻿not knowing if the boy is a legitimate child or a "natural" (bastard) child, avon purchases the boy from his brother, a tavern keeper. he takes the boy as his page, and léon follows him to society's highest functions, and even goes to a court party held by louis xv, where he sees the king himself (who looks just like the coins, he says), views the queen, and sees madame de pompadour. while at versailles, the duke displays léon before the comte's wife and his son and heir. he notes the resemblance of the son, henri, to léon's brother, jean bonnard, a tavern keeper. he also notes that the boy, léon's age, prefers rural life, and wants to be a farmer. after this excursion to versailles, the comte sends one of his satellites to purchase the page, but avon refuses. the duke's friend, hugh davenant, tries to convince avon to give him the page; they both have realized, separately, that the boy léon is actually the girl léonie. the duke journeys into champagne, where léonie has grown up, to meet a childhood mentor, the village priest who educated her. this old man confirms to him that the bonnard family came originally from the same province, indeed, from one of the estates, as the comte de saint-vire. the duke's desire for revenge soon turns to passion for justice as léon — or rather, léonie — has endeared herself to him. he takes her home to england and teaches her to be a girl again. after an attempt to lure léonie from avon court fails, the comte kidnaps her and carries her to france. léonie escapes from him and seeks refuge at an inn where avon finds her and rescues her from a second attempt to abduct her. in the meantime, fanny marling, the duke's sister, and his younger brother, lord rupert, also race to france to save her. the comte is forced to bide his time while léonie makes her parisian debut under the aegis of lady fanny. she becomes the toast of paris, and the comte and his wife watch helplessly, waiting for avon to take his revenge. a rumor comes to léonie’s ears that she is the comte’s illegitimate child—the family likeness is very striking. when she confronts him with it, the comte realizes he has a chance to turn the tables on avon. admitting the rumor, the comte tries to persuade léonie he abducted her to save her. she does not believe him, but his threat to use her to harm avon’s reputation makes her agree to go away where no one will ever find her. she takes refuge with her old tutor, the priest in her home village. avon swiftly realizes what the comte has done. at a party with the paris nobility watching, avon tells her pathetic story as a fable and the parisian high society, to their growing horror, realize the truth: that léonie is indeed the comte’s legitimate daughter and that she was switched at birth with a farm laborer’s son to prevent the comte’s detested brother from inheriting the comte’s title. avon tells them how she suffered from the comte’s actions and of his threat to use her to hurt the man she loves. then, with a twist, he lets them believe that léonie has drowned herself in the seine. this breaks her mother, whose open grief betrays the comte’s guilt. knowing he is ruined in society, the comte shoots himself. his despised brother becomes the new comte. with no difficulty, avon traces léonie to her childhood home in the country. she is glad her father is dead, but refuses to go back to her life in paris. she doesn’t want her family back — she wants avon, but he knows his tainted reputation makes him unworthy of her. she doesn’t care. avon returns to paris in triumph to present his new duchess, léonie. devil's cub follows these old shades with the adventures of avon's and léonie's son, dominque, and shockingly selfish and indulged young man who elopes with a poor relation of one of his father's friends. an infamous army completes the story with the duke of avon's great-granddaughter, barbara, marrying the hero of an infamous army. an infamous army is also a sequel to regency buck. ||| 3 ||| 2
tony miglione and his working-class family live in jersey city, new jersey. when his older brother ralph and his wife angie announce they are having a baby but lack money to care for the child, tony's parents offer to help. both of tony's parents work extra shifts to try and raise enough money. tony's father, an electrician who tries his hand at inventing in his spare time, is inspired to invent wireless electrical cartridges, which he then patents and sells to a large company called j.w. fullerbach electronics. mr. miglione is then made a plant manager for a fullerbach factory which will manufacture his invention. this new job brings to the miglione family a large increase in wealth and a move from jersey city to rosemont, new york, a fictitious affluent long island town where tony has to deal with sudden changes coinciding with his growing into adolescence—his mother is becoming a social-climbing phony, his brother quits teaching and ends up going into the family business, and his grandmother (unable to speak since the removal of her larynx due to cancer and a woman who enjoyed housework) is no longer permitted to cook or clean because the family has hired a housekeeper. add to this the emotional upheaval that comes with puberty while his new friend joel hoober acts obnoxiously, makes prank phone calls and has a tendency to shoplift. tony is also a secret peeping tom, watching joel's gorgeous sister, lisa, undress from his bedroom window. he later asks for a set of binoculars too, for christmas, under the guise of becoming a bird watcher, while they are obviously for him to view lisa more clearly. besides dealing with the move and his feelings about lisa hoober, tony experiences anxiety attacks, which mainly strike when joel commits a misdeed and tony feels he cannot betray his friend and tell anyone. joel's shoplifting is a major catalyst for these attacks, and one is so great it sends tony into a state of shock and results in his immediate hospitalization. tony's parents also arrange for him to meet with a psychologist (although his mother initially is against it, claiming he has no problems) who eventually gains tony's trust. the therapy seems to be a great success for tony. later it is revealed that tony has lost a measure of respect for his older brother, ralph, when he learns that ralph will be giving up teaching to go into his father's business. in jersey city, ralph had been known among his friends as "the wizard of seventh grade social studies," and was a popular junior high school teacher. tony does not believe ralph is scientifically oriented, like their deceased brother vinnie was, and is giving up his true calling to follow the same social-climbing path as his parents. ralph rationalizes his job change in that he wishes to provide for his daughter and future children. tony thinks to himself it does not take that much money to raise a child, and it runs the risk of spoiling those children and in turn may end up worse as a result of being raised in such an affluent environment, as he has seen firsthand with joel's lack of parental oversight and the idea the hoobers are doing their jobs solely by providing a fancy home life for him. while leaving a store one day, joel is stopped by one of the store's security guards. joel immediately denies stealing anything and looks to tony to corroborate the story: tony refuses and joel is apprehended. joel later tells tony that his punishment for shoplifting isn't very harsh in terms of the law but he'll have to go to a military academy when school starts again. surprisingly, joel doesn't seem to blame tony for this outcome. in the end, tony finds a certain amount of peace as he accepts his life with help of his counselor. he also resolves to put away his binoculars to stop his voyeurism, but also notes wryly, "then again, maybe i won't." ||| 7 ||| 7
the novel is set in the early 3800s and takes place almost entirely on the faraway oceanic planet of thalassa. thalassa has a small human population sent there by way of an embryonic seed pod, one of many sent out from earth in an attempt to continue the human race's existence before the earth is destroyed. it starts with an introduction to the native thalassans &ndash; the marine biologist mirissa, her partner brant and other friends and family. their peaceful existence comes to an end with the appearance of the magellan, a spaceship from earth containing one million colonists who have been put into cryonic suspension. in a series of descriptive passages the events leading up to the race to save the human species are explained. scientists in the 1960s discover that the neutrino emissions from the sun &ndash; a result of the nuclear reactions that fuel the star &ndash; are far diminished from expected levels. less than a decade later, it is confirmed that the problem is not with the scientific equipment: the sun is calculated to go nova around the year ad 3600. the human race's technology advances enough for various factions to send out pods containing human and other mammalian embryos (and later on, simply stored dna sequences), along with robot parents, to planets that are considered habitable. sending live humans is ruled out due to the immense amount of fuel that a rocket-propelled spacecraft would have to carry in order to first accelerate to the speeds required to travel such great distances within an acceptable time, and then decelerate upon approaching the destination. however, less than a hundred years before the sun is set to go nova a scientific break-through allows construction of the quantum drive, which bypasses this problem. there only remains enough time to build and send to the stars a single quantum-drive ship: the magellan. thalassa's only connection with earth (and anywhere else) was a single communication dish, which was destroyed during a volcanic eruption 400 years ago and never repaired, thus leaving the thalassans unaware of later developments on earth. the magellan stops at thalassa to replenish the mammoth ice shield that had prevented micrometeors from damaging it during its interstellar journey. thalassa is the obvious choice for this operation, as 95% of the planet's surface is covered by water. at the end of the novel the magellan continues on to its destination, the planet sagan 2. as a kind of sub-plot it is revealed that beneath thalassa's oceans there live sentient beings similar to the sea scorpions of earth, only much larger. they are discovered – and named "scorps" – when it attracts attention that robots designed to seek out fish frequently go missing. the scorps gain the robots' metal in order to make bands of honour and rank. the scorps are proven farmers; they have created their own village out of underwater rock caves. some of the crew aboard the magellan begin to consider mutiny, wanting to stay in the secure environment of thalassa rather than make the journey on to an unknown planet that may indeed be habitable, but just as well not. the situation is solved just before take-off &ndash; the mutineers are left with the thalassans, while the bulk of the crew and passengers continue on to sagan 2. the book finishes with mirissa sending messages to her lover, loren lorenson aboard the magellan, showing him their son. loren is not going to see the child until long after its and mirissa's death. mirissa's last clear sight when she is old is of the fading star in the thalassan sky that is the quantum drive of the magellan. ||| 5 ||| 5
wimsey's mother, the dowager duchess of denver, telephones to say that thipps, an architect hired to do some work on her local church, has just found a dead body wearing nothing but a pair of pince-nez in the bath in his flat. the official investigator, inspector sugg, suspects thipps and his servant; wimsey starts his own enquiry. sir reuben levy, a famous financier, has disappeared from his own bedroom, and there has been a flurry of trading in some peruvian oil shares. inspector parker, wimsey's friend, is investigating this. the corpse in the bath is not levy, but wimsey becomes convinced that the two are linked. the trail leads to the teaching hospital near the architect's flat, and to surgeon and neurologist sir julian freke, who is based there. wimsey discovers that freke murdered sir reuben and staged his 'disappearance' from home, having borne a grudge for years over lady levy, who chose to marry sir reuben rather than him. he also engineered the trading in oil shares, to lure sir reuben to his death. he dismembered sir reuben and gave him to his students to dissect, substituting his body for that of a pauper donated to the hospital for that purpose, who bore a superficial resemblance to sir reuben. the pauper's body, washed, shaved and manicured, was then carried over the roofs and dumped in thipps' bath as a joke. freke's belief that conscience and guilt are inconvenient physiological aberrations, which may be cut out and discarded, are an explanation for his conduct. he attempts to murder both parker and wimsey, and finally tries suicide when his actions are discovered, but is arrested in time. the book establishes many of wimsey's character traits - for example, his interest in rare books, the nervous problems associated with his wartime shell-shock, and his ambiguous feelings about catching criminals for a hobby - and also introduces many characters who recur in later novels, such as parker, bunter, sugg, and the dowager duchess. there is a passing reference in the book to freddy arbuthnot, wimsey's friend and contact for the stock market, being in love with sir reuben levy's daughter rachel and wanting to marry her. this theme is picked up in strong poison, taking place seven years later, when freddy at last manages to convince rachel's family to consent to the match despite his being a gentile - after freddy compared his long wait with that of the biblical jacob for his rachel. whose body? is now in the public domain in the united states, but may still be copyrighted elsewhere. ||| 3 ||| 6
at the beginning, we see that the cats of the dark forest are training breezepelt and other cats in the same way they trained lionblaze. hawkfrost begins to visit ivypaw in her dreams and teaches her many battle moves, pretending he is from starclan. ivypaw, still jealous that dovepaw is keeping secrets from her own kin, decides not to tell anyone about hawkfrost's training. leopardstar, leader of riverclan, loses her last life, and mistyfoot takes her place as leader of riverclan. the three reveal to firestar who they are; firestar reveals that he suspected it all along, but had his doubts after hollyleaf's death. firestar tells the three what he knows about them, and delivers a crucial piece of information: the prophecy is not from starclan. after days of rain, dovepaw senses a tree on the edge of the hollow about to fall. she warns firestar and the clan, and they manage to evacuate the camp before the tree falls. however, mousefur stays behind, refusing to give up on a mouse that she was eating. longtail goes back for the mouse, and briarpaw goes back for longtail. as a result, briarpaw's hind legs are paralyzed, and longtail is killed. with leafpool's help, jayfeather finds out that littlecloud had the same problem with another cat. the cat's lack of exercise allowed a chest infection to make it harder for him to breathe, eventually killing him. jayfeather vows not to let briarpaw die, but near the end of the book briarpaw starts to develop a perhaps deadly cough. briarpaw, bumblepaw, and blossompaw get their warrior names: briarlight, blossomfall, and bumblestripe. tigerstar tells ivypaw that giving a strip of land to shadowclan has endangered thunderclan. ivypaw believes tigerstar and tells firestar that she had a dream from starclan of shadowclan invading, because they believe that firestar is too weak to keep his own territory. firestar and the senior warriors decide to attack shadowclan before they can attack thunderclan. during the battle lionblaze kills russetfur, but not before she deprives firestar of his seventh life. lionblaze then looks upon the misery and death that the battle has brought, and believes that it should have never occurred. ||| 2 ||| 2
the night circus is a phantasmagorical fairy tale set near an ahistorical victorian london in a wandering magical circus that is open only from sunset to sunrise. le cirque des rêves, the circus of dreams, features such wonders and "ethereal enigmas" as a blooming garden made all of ice, acrobats soaring without a net, and a vertical cloud maze where patrons who get lost simply step off and float gently to the floor. the circus has no set schedule, appearing without warning and leaving without notice; they travel in a train disguised as an ordinary coal transport. a network of devoted fans styling themselves "rêveurs" ("dreamers") develops around the circus; they identify to each other by adding a splash of red to garb that otherwise matches the characteristic black and white of the circus tents. the magical nature of the circus is occluded under the guise of legerdemain; the illusionist truly transforms her jacket into a raven and the fortune teller truly reads the uncertain future, and both are applauded for their ingenuity. the circus serves a darker purpose beyond entertainment and profit. the magicians prospero the enchanter and the enigmatic mr. a.h— groom their young proteges, celia and marco, to proxy their rivalry with the exhibits as a stage. prospero teaches his daughter to hone her innate talents by holding ever larger and more complex magical workings in her mind. celia takes her position on the game board as the illusionist who makes true transformations, adding tents and maintaining wondrous aspects from the inside. mr. a.h— trains his orphan ward with books in the ways of glyphs and sympathetic magic and illusory worlds that exist only in the mind of the beholder. marco takes a position as majordomo to the producer of the circus; he works from the outside in, connected to the circus but not a part of it. the two beguile the circus goers and each other with nightly wonders, soon falling in love despite being magically bound to a deadly competition with rules neither understands; the magical courtship strains the fate laid out for them and endangers the circus that has touched the lives of so many and cannot survive without the talents of both players. ||| 2 ||| 2
following grantville's alliance with gustavus adolphus and their military successes, texts of modern day history books of the seventeenth century have became very popular among the powerful personages of europe and made dramatic effects and turmoil on the continent. among those that are affected are the holy roman catholic church with their religious holdings. father lawrence mazzare started the controversy by allowing father fredrich von spee to read his own entry in the catholic encyclopedia, thereby stiffening the jesuit's resistance to the inquisition. also mazzare provided copies of the papers of the second vatican council and other documents to monsignor giulio mazarini, which led pope urban viii to request a summary of catholic theological reforms over the following centuries in the original timeline. the newly formed use acts to open a trade corridor with the middle east via venice to insure supplies of materials unavailable within western europe; gaining political allies within these regions; and religious allies to spread the doctrines of religious tolerance and the separation of church and state. michael stearns selects lawrence mazzare to lead the delegation to venice because of his current fame (or notoriety) among catholics. mazzare asks simon jones, the methodist minister, to accompany him as a sign of religious tolerance and father augustus heinzerling. jones goes along as mazzare's assistant. stearns also sends tom stone and his family to assist with the production of pharmaceuticals, sharon nichols to aid in medical education (and to give her something useful to do while she is grieving over hans richter's death in 1633), and ernst mauer to advise on public sanitation. lieutenant conrad ursinus is sent as the naval attaché and advisor on shipbuilding and scottish captain andrew lennox is assigned as the military attaché and commander of the marine guard. lieutenant billy trumble is sent as xo of the marine escort as well as sports advisor. however, the delegation is opposed by the french embassy in venice led by claude de mesmes, comte d'avaux, who is given orders by cardinal richelieu to disrupt trade negotiations between the use and venice. ||| 5 ||| 5
phoenix and ashes is about a girl named eleanor robinson and a pilot named reginald fenyx. eleanor's mother died and her father remarried a woman named alison, who already had two daughters. when her father was killed in the great war, alison showed her true nature as an elemental master of earth who practiced the dark blood-fueled arts. eleanor was bound to the hearth by a fearsome ritual and people forgot all about her. reginald fenyx, an aristocrat and an elemental master of air, loved to fly. during the great war, he enlisted in the royal flying corps, and became known as an air ace. however, he met another elemental in combat and crashed; he was trapped under rubble for days while dark earth creatures tormented him. this was particularly torturous because air (reginald's element) is the opposite of earth. when he was rescued, he was a traumatized and broken man who had abandoned magic. the main plot of the book involves alison's attempts to marry one of her daughters to reginald and become nobility. meanwhile, eleanor's ability to use fire magic awakens, with the tutelage of her godmother sarah and strange beings who visit her in dreams. reginald appears briefly in another novel in the series, the serpent's shadow, which is set a few years before he becomes a pilot in world war i/the great war. at this time he is an oxford student and dr. maya witherspoon's future fiancee, peter scott, remarks that while reginald is studying to be a lawyer, the boldness of his personality marked him as a future military man instead. ||| 2 ||| 6

"d", a patriot from a country suffering a civil war is in england to secure a contract with coal magnate lord benditch that will greatly assist the faltering loyalist cause. the country is kept nameless and the details of its history, geography and current politics remain vague; still, there could be little doubt - and greene himself admitted as much - that the spanish civil war was the main inspiration for the book's depiction of a left-leaning, popular revolutionary republic, internally embroiled in bitter factional fights while having to fight a brutal civil war and faced with a land-owning aristocracy determined to destroy the republic so as to regain its centuries-old privileged position. (in the final part, moreover, it is specifically noted that a ship travelling from england to the country in question must sail westward in the channel and then cross the bay of biscay.) ||| 3 ||| 5

get advance copies of his book. after work she gets home to find that her boss jerome and his angel friend carter are at her house and they think she killed duane. when she assures them she didn’t and

neverwhere is the story of richard mayhew and his trials and tribulations in london. at the start of the story, he is a young businessman, with a normal life. all this changes, however, when he stops to help a mysterious young girl who appears before him, bleeding and weakened, as he walks with his fiancée to dinner to meet her influential boss. the morning after richard rescued the girl, door, from the streets, she is greatly recovered, and sends him to find the marquis de carabas, a man who will be able to help door escape two infamous and seemingly inhuman assassins, the messrs; croup and vandemar. richard brings the marquis back to his apartment to meet door, only to see both of them vanish immediately. soon after, richard begins to realize the consequences of his actions. he appears to have become invisible; he loses his job, where no one seems to recognize him, and his apartment is rented out to other people. determined to set things right, richard sets out for the world of london below in search of door. richard’s journey takes him to the realm of the rat-speakers, who worship and perform tasks for rats, across the mysterious night's bridge, whose darkness kills one of richard’s rat-speaker friends, anesthesia, and eventually to the floating market, where he meets again with door, who is holding an audition for bodyguards. going to the floating market, a giant bazaar where people barter for all manner of junk and magical items, richard realizes that london below is not such a bad place. the legendary bodyguard and fighter "hunter" joins their party, and the group, consisting of door, the marquis and hunter, with richard tagging along, sets out for the earl's court. door and the marquis have traveled to door's home, and discovered a diary entry made by door's father, which advises her to seek aid from the angel islington. when the four reach the earl's court, on a mysterious underground train which follows its own bizarre schedule, the marquis is forced to leave. this is due to an old grudge between himself and the earl. the rest discover that they need to travel through the angelus in order to reach islington, and that the angelus resides in the british museum. door and richard travel to the museum, while hunter, due to a curse which prevents her from entering london above, remains in the abandoned british museum underground station. after some searching they find the angelus, which door "opens" using her family's talent, and travel through it to the underground home of the angel. islington explains that his position as protector of london below is a punishment for the submersion of atlantis, which was also under his care, and tells door that he will help her learn the identity of those who killed her family, for a price. she and her company must retrieve a unique key from the black friars and bring it to the angel. the two return to the museum and go below to reunite with hunter. in the meantime, the marquis seeks out croup and vandemar, exchanging a priceless tang dynasty figurine for information regarding who ordered the murder of door's family. the true price for this information, however, is his life; croup and vandemar capture, torture, and kill him, breaking the one-hour "head start" agreement that was part of their deal with the marquis. door, richard, and hunter proceed onward to the dwelling of the black friars. there, they are faced with a series of three ordeals; hunter wins a test of strength, door wins a test of intellect, and richard, alone in history, wins a test of character. he was falsely convinced his adventures below had all been a hallucination, but a trinket from his now-dead friend anesthesia re-orients him. as a result, the three succeed in gaining the key. richard’s ordeal greatly changes him, causing him to lose most of his self-doubts; he is now confident enough to interact with other beings of london below. the three then travel to the floating market, where they are unable to find the marquis, but where hammersmith, a blacksmith friend of door's is able to secretly forge a copy of the key won by richard. richard enlists the mysterious lamia, one of the vampire-like velvets as a guide. they travel on london below’s down street, toward islington. door, richard, lamia, and hunter make their way down the long path of down street. old bailey revives the marquis. weakened, the marquis sets out himself, following door and company. on down street, it is discovered that lamia was a dangerous choice for a guide, because the price she demands of richard for her services is higher than he can pay and yet live, but he is rescued by the marquis. it is also discovered that hunter long ago turned traitor to door’s cause. she gives door to croup and vandemar, in exchange for the magical spear she needs to hunt and slay the great beast of london. croup and vandemar, with door captive, travel downward, while richard, the marquis, and hunter travel at a slower pace, all toward the great labyrinth through which they need to pass to reach islington. in this labyrinth the beast of london dwells. hunter and richard battle it, with richard being the only survivor. richard and the marquis rush ahead, to the final confrontation between the parties, in which islington’s true nature is revealed. islington wishes to use door and the key to force open the door to heaven, where he seeks dominion over all the other angels as revenge for his banishment. after richard is tortured by croup and vandemar, door agrees to open the door, but she uses the copy of the key richard won. the key does not open the door to heaven, but instead to somewhere else, as far away as she could imagine. islington, croup and vandemar are all sucked through the gateway before door closes it. door then uses the black friars' real key to allow richard to travel back to london above, where he finds himself restored to his normal life as it was before he first met door. after returning home, richard is happy for a time, but he realizes that his experiences have changed him, and that his old life and friends mean little or nothing to him now. he realizes that he is not satisfied with the regular world, and wants to return to london below but does not know how to do it. he despairs of returning, feeling that he has ruined his life about as completely as possible, but in the end the marquis provides a way back. ||| 2 ||| 2
genly ai, a native of the planet terra (earth), is an envoy from the ekumen, an organization of more than eighty worlds, representing 3,000 countries, spanning one hundred light years from border to border, whose purpose is to develop commerce, communications, and, possibly, mystical unity. ai's mission is to convince the country of karhide on the distant planet called gethen to join the ekumen. his story of that mission consists mainly of his own observations with interpolated chapters of karhide tales and myths, ekumen data, sayings from orgoreyn (karhide's neighbor), and excerpts from the diary of therem harth rem ir estraven, prime minister of karhide to mad king argaven xv. the planet gethen is called winter by the ekumen because it is in the grip of an ice age. ai is constantly challenged by the unrelenting cold, by the karhide custom of shifgrethor (a nuanced system of dignity-preserving conversational tactics), and by the androgynous nature of all the people who populate winter. estraven's androgynous nature further obscures him to ai. although all of winter's androgynes are referred to as "he," the fact is they are neither "he" nor "she" until they enter kemmer, a state of estrus lasting a few days a month, analogous to a menstrual cycle but with an unreasoning urge to mate. then, depending on the chemistry between partners, one will develop as a male, the other as a female. the same person can be a child-bearing mother to some children and a father to others. just as ai struggles to comprehend the sexlessness of the gethen, the gethen regard ai's fixed gender, and his claims of an entire civilization divided into male and female, as anomalous and disturbing; indeed, ai is considered a "pervert" (a creature always in kemmer). their androgynous biology, which eliminates male dominance, female dependency or childrearing, and sexual tension, is the underpinning for the culture and politics on winter, a planet that has no word for war and no experience of it. yet the two countries of karhide and orgoreyn seem to be on the brink of war over disputed territory. estraven is exiled as a traitor when he is outmaneuvered by a more bellicose faction, and given three days to leave karhide under pain of death. he flees to orgoreyn, a soviet-like bureaucracy where his lack of proper papers condemns him to the life of a factory worker. finally he is discovered by some commensals, politicians of high status somewhat like senators, and introduced into the socialist politics of orgoreyn. ai also travels to orgoreyn. since the king of karhide has rejected his proposal to join the ekumen, he thinks perhaps the neighboring country will be interested. orgoreyn is considerably different from karhide, a bureaucracy compared to a monarchy; orgoreyn's yomesh religion denies the dark yet is an offspring of karhide's handdara which espouses both light and dark for "[l]ight is the left hand of darkness "; orgoreyn's people are supposedly more progressive and yet they live under a corrupt political system with the darkness of secret police and concentration camp prisons and, on the whole, have less humane values than the people of karhide. although estraven tries to warn ai of the shifting politics, again ai doesn't understand. he ends up being betrayed by a politician with ties to the secret police and is taken away in a truck with other unfortunates to a prison, cynically called a voluntary farm. all are naked, freezing, and hungry. once imprisoned, ai has little to look forward to until he is rescued through the daring of estraven. unfortunately, the road back to karhide is over the gobrin ice. ai and estraven battle the snow and ice, glacier and crevasse, wind and night. through cooperation, for ai is physically superior to estraven while estraven has superior survival skills, the two become closer. ai realizes that while estraven is a forced exile, he himself has chosen to exile himself from his family, friends, and, in fact, several generations by being a space traveler. ai was born on earth 127 years ago, but because of timejumping is not quite 30. ai teaches estraven telepathy, or mindspeech. estraven hears ai's voice as that of his dead brother arek to whom he swore kemmering. although incest between siblings is not taboo, they are forbidden to swear allegiance for life. ai begins to understand estraven better. when estraven goes into kemmer, although both avoid a sexual relationship, ai sees the full womanly side of estraven and finally understands his friend as a complete person, and, by extension, understands the androgynous people of gethen. when the two return to karhide, the exiled estraven is discovered, and as he skis to the orgoreyn border, he skis straight into the guards who shoot him, a seeming suicide. this too is a karhide taboo. estraven dies in ai's arms, mindspeaking the name of his dead brother. ai is successful in convincing the king to join the ekumen, but when the crew from the spaceship alight, ai is repulsed by their overt sexuality. in the final chapter he visits estraven's family who are distraught because estraven is still considered a traitor. ai had not cleared his name as he promised, because he didn't want to jeopardize his mission, gethen's entry into the ekumen, a mission for which estraven gave his life. however, estraven's son sorve by his now-dead brother shows the same kind of curiosity as his father, the kind which characterizes human progress: he asks ai to tell him about other worlds and other lives he has seen. ||| 2 ||| 5
rhapsody travels with ashe to deliver a dragon's claw, long ago hidden among the treasures of ylorc, for fear of the dragon's wreaking vengeance upon those who would keep her claw from her. on the journey, ashe and rhapsody develop a degree of comfort with one another, punctuated by arguments. upon their arrival, rhapsody finds the dragon surprisingly friendly, and she stays for several days before departing. meanwhile, in the halls of ylorc, grunthor and achmed discover a hidden tunnel, leading to the loritorium: the unfinished masterpiece of ylorc's builder, centuries past. to their surprise, gruthor and achmed are confronted by a dhracian as they investigate: one of the last of a near-legendary race, to which achmed owes half his heritage. the dhracian, who calls herself the grandmother, instructs achmed and grunthor to return with rhapsody. rhapsody, after leaving the dragon's cave, travels to tyrian, the forest home to the lirin, so that she can meet and train with the former bearer of her elemental blade, daystar clarion. while in training, she sees a horrific vision of the world engulfed in blood after the death of the patriarch, leader of one of the two major human religions. rhapsody journeys to sepulvarta, home of the patriarch, and successfully defends the patriarch against an attack by a f'dor demon and his minion, the rakshas. she then travels back to ylorc, where grunthor and achmed lead her to the grandmother. the grandmother tells them of the dhracian colony that had lived in the mountains of ylorc for centuries, destroyed by the same saboteur who murdered the inhabitants of the loritorium. she also shows them the treasure the dhracian colony was founded to protect: the sleeping child of earth, whose second rib can be used as a key to open the vault of the underworld imprisoning most of the f'dor. the child of earth's sleep is restless, rocked with prophetic nightmares, but rhapsody is unable to help. after finally figuring out ashe's secret, rhapsody summons ashe to her underground home in ylorc with a carefully crafted song. once he arrives, rhapsody explains her realizations: ashe is gwydion, long believed dead after he failed in an attack on the f'dor and had part of his soul torn out in the process. gwydion was secretly resurrected by the power of the star which once adorned daystar clarion's hilt, however, awakening his dragon side in the process, and had wandered the land in secrecy for the decades following the attack. the lost piece of his soul was used to create the rakshas, which wreaked havoc with ashe's appearance. ashe and rhapsody become lovers, causing jo (rhapsody's adopted sister) no end of jealousy. the rakshas uses this to trick jo - pretending to be ashe, he has sex with her, bringing her partially under the control of the f'dor in the process. in an attempt to reclaim the stolen piece of ashe's soul, rhapsody sets out with grunthor and achmed to destroy the rakshas. the demonically-influenced jo nearly kills achmed at the end of the battle, forcing rhapsody to kill her to save achmed, and subsequently battle to save her soul from the clutching vine of the f'dor. some days later, ashe and rhapsody meet again for a night of revelations. ashe locks the memory of the night in a pearl, expecting the only thing said to be of his father, llauron, concocted to use rhapsody in a bid for power. in the course of the discussion, ashe and rhapsody learn to their surprise that they are (respectively) sam and emily, who loved one another one and a half millennia ago (it's complicated.) they get married, but rhapsody agrees that she will have to forget it all so that llauron's selfish plot can succeed. then a tree root that the rakshas corrupted attacks the child of earth, attempting to seize it (and thereby gain the key to the underworld), but grunthor, forewarned by a dream, manages to get rhapsody and achmed into position soon enough to avert the threat. then they realize that the rakshas conceived children with demon-tainted blood, who rhapsody resolves to rescue. ||| 2 ||| 2
the story takes place after the events of second contact, which involved the tng crew being transported to the marvel universe, where they aid the x-men against kang the conqueror. however, a mysterious force (later revealed, to the reader, to be the entity q) causes the x-men to be dragged into the star trek universe (depicted both in the novel and on the final page of second contact); though this happens to the x-men immediately (from their point of view) after parting with the crew of the u.s.s. enterprise-e, a noticeable period of time has passed for the crew since returning to their own timeline. the x-men and enterprise crew face a problem all too familiar to the marvel mutants: a planet where some of the population have been spontaneously developing destructive, and often uncontrollable, super-powers, causing them to be quarantined and shunned by their fellow citizens—until, that is, one of the "transformed" with the power to cause earthquakes escapes and leads his fellow super-powered outcasts in a revolution. matters worsen when it is discovered that these beings had been genetically engineered by an aggressive alien race as living weapons, and now their creators were coming to collect them by force. when the enterprise is dispatched by the federation to assist in investigating the transformed crisis, they are attacked by a ship belonging to this other race, its weapons proving powerful enough to deplete the enterprises shields in just two hits. working with the x-men, the enterprise crew manage to disable the ship, nightcrawler teleporting himself and data over to the enemy ship through its shields- data being selected due to his knowledge of alien technology and his inability to get tired ensuring that he would not be negatively affected by nightcrawler's abilities- and allowing them to shut down the ship's defenses long enough for a team including worf, banshee and archangel to transport over and do further damage. with the ship disabled, the x-men join the away teams down on the planet, with storm soon defeating the rogue leader of the transformed, even as data and nightcrawler manage to convince the other transformed to listen to them by demonstrating how they also differ from those around them but are still willing to trust others. the crisis resolved, dr. crusher- aided by a hologram of professor x created based on information acquired from the mansion's computers during the enterprises visit to the x-men's universe- manages to develop a cure for the transformed before the x-men are sent back to their reality. it is revealed at the end that this situation had been at least partly caused by q and uatu the watcher, q having manipulated events to send the x-men through to the 'trekverse' to help the enterprise deal with the transformed crisis. ||| 5 ||| 5
after finding that her child is diagnosed with leukemia, anne anderson notices a high incidence of leukemia, a relatively rare disease, in her city. eventually she gathers other families and seeks a lawyer, jan schlichtmann, to consider their options. schlichtmann originally decides not to take the case due to both the lack of evidence and a clear defendant. later picking up the case, schlichtmann finds evidence suggesting trichloroethylene (tce) contamination of the town's water supply by riley tannery, a subsidiary of beatrice foods; a chemical company, w.r. grace; and another company named unifirst. in the course of the lawsuit schlichtmann gets other attorneys to assist him. he spends lavishly as he had in his prior lawsuits, but the length of the discovery process and trial stretch all of their assets to their limit. though unifirst settles for a little over $1 million, the money immediately is invested in the case against grace and beatrice. the plaintiffs' case against grace is far stronger for two reasons: (1) schlichtmann has personal testimony of a former employee of grace who had witnessed dumping, and (2) a river between beatrice's tannery and the contaminated wells make their contribution to the contamination less plausible. the case against beatrice is dismissed by judge skinner. though schlichtmann's firm anticipates a much higher settlement, the dire state of its finances forces it to accept settlement from w.r. grace for $8 million. schlichtmann disburses the settlement to the families, excluding expenses and attorney's fees (which resulted in approx. $375,000 per family). when some families think schlichtmann had overbilled expenses, he acquiesces and surrenders more of his fee. schlichtmann later files for bankruptcy after losing his condo and car; he lives in his office for a time. schlichtmann eventually practices environmental, civil and personal injury law. a report from the environmental protection agency (which later filed its own lawsuits against the companies based on new evidence) concludes that both companies had contaminated the wells from sludge removed from the site. in 1988 schlichtmann attempts to reraise the case against beatrice, but the judge dismisses the case, citing testimony from beatrice's soil chemist. however, due to the lawsuits brought forward by the environmental protection agency w.r. grace and beatrice foods are eventually forced to pay for the largest chemical clean up in the history of the northeastern united states which cost about $64 million. ||| 4 ||| 6
zubrin contends that opec nations, particularly saudi arabia, have used their enormous oil wealth to fund islamic extremism; in effect, the us is financing both sides of the war on terror. they have been able to do this through colluding illegally to keep oil prices high. due to its dependence on their oil, the united states (and the rest of the world) is powerless to do anything about this. the key to winning the war on terror, therefore, is to create a substitute for oil. zubrin argues that a mandate that all new cars sold in the united states be flex-fueled (ffv, for flex-fuel vehicle, able to run on gasoline, ethanol or methanol, or any combination thereof) would very quickly make such vehicles the world standard, as occurred in the early 1980s with the introduction of catalytic converters. as a result, consumers would demand ethanol- and methanol-blended fuels due to their price competitiveness with gasoline, which would in turn prompt gas stations to instal biofuel pumps. under such a situation, competition would drive oil prices down. zubrin argues that biofuels should be subsidized in order to keep their price advantage over gasoline, as it is the only way to cripple opec. some have argued that a switch to electric cars would be more beneficial. while this may be a longer-term solution, a switch to biofuel can be achieved in a few years (as in the case of brazil). additionally, existing cars (including hybrids) can be retrofitted with flex-fuel capability for "between $100 and $500". a switch to biofuel would have the additional benefit that it is potentially a carbon-neutral fuel. ethanol is produced primarily via the fermentation of corn or sugar cane (or indeed any other glucose-rich crop). methanol can be produced from any plant matter. as both of these products can easily be produced in developing countries, zubrin contends that the resultant expanding market for farm produce would be greatly beneficial for third-world farmers. there would be no need for western nations to subsidize their own farmers, as third-world produce could be absorbed into the larger market without causing a price-crash that would bankrupt western farmers. anne korin, of the institute for the analysis of global security, has developed this concept further, adding to zubrin's mandate the necessity to eliminate ethanol and sugar import tariffs in the united states for it to succeed. ||| 4 ||| 4

the novel begins with a dedication to a mysterious beatrice, whom snicket describes as "darling, dearest, dead". the author then provides a brief explanation of why the book should not be read, before describing the series' protagonists: violet baudelaire, a 14-year old amateur inventor; klaus baudelaire, a 12-year old who loves to read, and sunny baudelaire, an infant with unusually powerful teeth. the baudelaire children have left the unspecified city in which they live to spend the day at the lonely briny beach. while enjoying the solitude, their parents' inept banker, arthur poe, arrives to inform them that their mother and father have both died in a fire which has destroyed their mansion and all of their possessions leaving him as executor of the baudelaire estate. the baudelaires briefly live with mr. poe and his wife, polly, sharing a room with their ill-behaved children edgar and albert. all three baudelaires are miserable and dislike their situation, but mr. poe soon informs them that, in accordance with their parent's will (which requests that the children be cared for "in the most convenient way possible"), he has located a distant uncle, count olaf, who lives within the city limits and is willing to become the children's legal guardian. on the car ride to olaf's house, mr. poe explains to the baudelaires that while olaf is titularly a count, he is also a professional stage actor. when the car arrives in olaf's neighborhood, the chits are greeted by the kindly justice strauss, a judge on the high court. when violet mistakes her for olaf's wife, however, strauss hastily explains that she is only a neighbor, and directs the children and mr. poe to the squalid and betowered house that is olaf's; carved on the front door is the image of a glaring eye. the children soon learn that olaf has only accepted their guardianship under the mistaken belief that he will receive their vast inheritance (which has been set aside until violet turns 18). olaf is sinister, self-absorbed, and unhygienic; he bears a tattoo of the glaring eye on his left ankle and a distinctive unibrow. when the count learns that he will not receive the baudelaire fortune, he immediately drops all pretenses of friendliness toward the children. every day count olaf leaves to work with his theater troupe, posting a list of often demeaning chores which the children must perform before his return home. although the house is spacious, the orphans are given only one room and one bed. they are strictly forbidden to enter olaf's tower study, and are provided with no belongings. eventually olaf informs the children by way of the chore list that his 10-man theater troupe will be coming over in the evening, when the baudelaires must serve dinner. having no suitable supplies to make a meal for ten, the children spend the day with justice strauss shopping for ingredients to make spaghetti alla puttanesca and chocolate pudding. that evening olaf arrives with his theater troupe, a motley crew which includes a man with hooks for hands, a bald man with a long nose, two women with white-powdered faces, and one who is so obese as to resemble neither a man nor a woman. the count and his troupe openly discuss his intentions to embezzle the children's inheritance, and olaf becomes outraged when he learns the children have not prepared roast beef. when klaus protests, olaf slaps him and grabs sunny, but calms down and allows the children to serve the puttanesca. the next day the baudelaires set out to find mr. poe, who works at mulctuary money management, and report olaf's abuse. poe explains that olaf is acting in loco parentis, and can raise them as he sees fit. the next morning, olaf stays late to speak with the baudelaires. he explains that mr. poe called him to address the children's concerns, and that as a first-time parent, he has been uncertain how to connect with them. olaf informs the children, to their dismay, that they will be performing with his theater troupe in their upcoming production the marvelous marriage. convinced that the performance is a scheme to steal their fortune, klaus spends the day researching inheritance law in justice strauss's personal library. his research is interrupted by the hook-handed man, however, who takes him back to olaf's house. klaus manages to grab a book on marriage law before he is taken away. during the night he discovers that a 14-year-old may get married with guardian consent, and realizes that olaf plans to legally marry violet in the marvelous marriage and in so doing form a concurrent estate, giving him unlimited access to their fortune. the next morning klaus heads out early to confront olaf with the evidence; the count confirms klaus's theory and informs him that sunny has been kidnapped on his behest and is being hung in a birdcage from the tower study window, to be dropped the moment he or his sister does not comply. that day violet attempts to visit sunny, but finds the door to the tower guarded by the associate who looks like neither a man nor a woman. during the night she builds a grappling hook to scale the tower. when she reaches the top, however, she is met by the hook-handed man, who locks her in the uppermost room of the tower and brings klaus to join her. together the three children wait out the night in anticipation of the marvelous marriage performance. the marvelous marriage itself serves little other purpose than as a vehicle for the wedding which is part olaf's little scheme that he is planning which had been planned by him to write the play under the name "al funcoot" which is olaf's anagram. justice strauss is procured for the role of the officiator (hence ensuring it is a legal ceremony), and violet plays the role of the bride. klaus is given a role with no lines, while sunny remains locked in the birdcage under the hook-handed man's supervision. every attempt the children make to speak to strauss or mr. poe (who has come to see the performance) is interrupted by olaf. when the time comes for violet to sign the wedding contract, she makes a final effort to annul the marriage by signing the document with her left hand rather than her right. (the law required the document to be signed in the bride's "own hand".) as soon as the contract has been signed, olaf announces that the performance is over, and that violet is now legally his wife. mr. poe, justice strauss, and many audience members object, but finally strauss concludes that the ceremony has been legal. to olaf's dismay, however, violet informs strauss that she has signed the document with the wrong hand, and the judge agrees that this is not in compliance with the law, rendering the ceremony annulled. olaf orders the hook-handed man to drop their infant sister, but sunny and the assistant have already arrived onstage. mr. poe attempts to arrest olaf, but one of the assistants turns the house lights off. in the darkness and ensuing confusion, only violet in her white wedding gown is readily visible. before he and his troupe escapes, olaf finds violet in the dark and promises her that he will get their fortune if it's the last thing he does. once order is restored, mr. poe calls the police, but only olaf's getaway car is found. justice strauss offers to adopt the baudelaires, but poe objects, observing that their parents' will instructs the children be raised by a relative. in compliance with the law, strauss bids the children goodbye and leaves them in the care of mr. poe. ||| 3 ||| 2
quinn begins by describing the earliest incarnation of a book like ishmael back in 1977, which quinn at the time called man and alien. this manuscript was revised over the next several years, resulting in five more incarnations (the genesis transcript, the book of nahash, the book of the damned, and two entitled another story to be in), none of which quinn could successfully get published. at last, though, quinn heard of the turner tomorrow fellowship award, which called for creative solutions to global problems. to win the award, though, quinn was required to translate his long-brewing thoughts for the first time into a work of fiction: a novel. quinn won the award with ishmael but was left unsure, until now, about what he should write as a follow-up. quinn details basic memories of his depression-era childhood in omaha, nebraska: specifically, the occurrence a dream in 1941 that he feels has influenced the rest of his life. in the dream, a tree is blocking the middle of a road he is traversing. a beetle crawls down the trunk to greet him and tells him that itself and other animals deliberately downed the tree to get quinn’s attention in order to talk with him. quinn is dumbfounded as the beetle says that the animals need to tell him the secret of their lives. quinn is then expected to follow a deer into the forest, because he is for some reason needed by the animals, but before he can venture on, he awakes. quinn recounts the gambling habits of his father (who he feels may have been friends with meyer lansky) and the sudden appearance of severe obsessive-compulsive tendencies in his mother. quinn’s parents habitually fought, each unable to understand the other’s behaviors. quinn feels his reaction to this was to try to perfect in himself what was unachievable with his parents in their relationship. quinn’s desire for perfection led him to an interest in the arts and a belief in catholicism. quinn received a full scholarship to st. louis university because of his writing, though left after two years to devote his life to his religion, by becoming a trappist monk at age nineteen. greatly influenced by thomas merton’s the seven storey mountain, quinn went to the abbey of gethsemani in kentucky. at gethsemani, merton in fact became quinn’s personal spiritual director. as a postulant at the monastery, quinn decided after a troublesome moment at the monastery, involving a miscommunication with a novice, that he had to either completely submit his will to that of god or else he had to leave the monastery. summoning his strength, quinn made the choice of submission to the complete guidance of god. the next time he stepped outside (having been indoors for three entire weeks), quinn experienced an unexpected moment of explosive, positive emotion, which he interpreted as infused contemplation, meaning utter centeredness on god: a feeling he describes as a "rage of joy." quinn convinced himself at the time that this awe-striking moment of beauty with the world was evidence of god's approval of his decision to submit. quinn told an incredulous merton of this amazing experience, but was soon discharged from the monastery by merton, who attributed the reason for quinn’s dismissal to the recent results of a rorschach test. quinn was crushed by his expulsion and began to see a psychoanalyst, as recommended by merton. quinn continued with his lifelong inability to understand his own sexuality, largely since his father always assumed him to be homosexual and because his current therapist thought him unready to be in any serious relationships. quinn, however, soon married a woman who later left him for another man. during this whole time, quinn continued to struggle with his self-destructive need to be perfect. when quinn talked to a priest who claimed to worry more about people than rules, quinn’s religious worldview began to crumble and he became an atheist. quinn then got a job in educational publishing, which instigated his questioning of the educational system of the united states; this came with the rise of the flower children of the 1960s. quinn briefly mentions the failure of his second marriage and his own willing movement toward going back to psychotherapy. quinn began to realize in therapy that his entire technique with social situations was to merely trick others into thinking he was worth knowing, while he actually believed himself valueless. one day, however, he was idly making a list of all his valuable attributes when he suddenly realized that he did not need to try to fake his personality in front of people; he did not need to be perfect&mdash;merely human. quinn explains that this newfound insight gave him the courage to ask out his future (and current) wife, rennie, on their first date. quinn then delivers his most recent understanding of learning and education, notably including the idea that formal education is an unnecessary social institution, since children learn automatically by following the behaviors of fellow members of their culture and by pursuing their own innate interests (which rigidly-structured public schools largely stop from happening). he also refers to his discontents with how history is studied in its disregard for tribal societies, reiterating many of the themes from ishmael. finally, he examines religion, including his own more recent advocacy of animism, which he considers the one-time world religion with its refreshing lack of any sacred text, institutions, or dogma. he revisits the memory of his “rage of joy” moment, now understating it in animist terms. he concludes with the thought that many needy people (like himself prior to his epiphany) are just those who do not feel needed. he asserts that the reader should feel needed because he or she is needed: needed desperately by the community of life to understand humanity's forgotten interdependence with the rest of that community. ||| 4 ||| 4

this novel begins with a brief prologue describing the aliens who created the black monoliths. they apparently evolved from "primordial soup", and over the course of millions of years, turned into a space-faring species. as they explored the universe, they saw that few intelligent species ever successfully evolved. therefore, they traveled the universe and catalyzed the evolution of intelligent species wherever they went, including earth, by increasing the evolving species' odds of survival. upon reaching earth, they performed experiments on many species to encourage the development of intelligence. then they left, leaving their black monoliths behind. after visiting the earth, the extraterrestrials continued to evolve, eventually to the point where they found a way to impress themselves into the fabric of space and time, thus becoming noncorporeal beings. meanwhile, back in the solar system, the alien monoliths continued to watch over humanity. however, sometimes the monoliths were prone to degenerating and acting independently of their original programming. 3001 follows the adventures of frank poole, the astronaut who was killed by the hal-9000 computer in 2001: a space odyssey by tearing his spacesuit open and casting him on a trajectory into deep space. one thousand years later, poole's freeze-dried body is discovered out in the kuiper belt beyond the orbit of neptune by a human spaceship, a comet-collecting space tug named the goliath. the advanced medical science and technology of that age is able to bring poole back to life. being freeze-dried and then kept near absolute zero for the intervening centuries preserved poole's body and brain well enough for him to make a full recovery. poole is next taken home to explore and learn about the earth in the year 3001, a millennium after he left it. some of its notable features include the braincap, a brain-computer interface technology that connects a computer directly to the human brain, genetically engineered dinosaur servants, a space drive, and four gigantic space elevators spaced evenly around the equator. human beings have also colonized the jovian moons ganymede and callisto. during the 26th century, the remains of an alien monolith has been found in the olduvai gorge in east africa (the one that had that kickstarted human evolution). tma-1, the black monolith that had been found on the moon in 1999, was brought to the earth in 2006 and then erected in front of the united nations building in new york city. in the course of the novel, it is determined that following the events of 2010: odyssey two and 2061: odyssey three the jovian monolith had sent a report back to its makers some 450 light years away. it is expected to receive its orders on how to deal with humanity after the 900-year round-trip. presumably, the monolith was empowered to obliterate the nascent biosphere of jupiter, but it needed a higher authority's approval to obliterate the technological civilization on earth. there is considerable worry that the judgment, which was based on the monolith's observations of humanity up to 2061, will be negative. the entire human race, then, may be in danger of being obliterated by the aliens, just as the jovian life-forms discovered by david bowman were deliberately destroyed in the course of making jupiter into a second sun so the europans could evolve. frank manages to conscript bowman and hal, who had fused into a new entity — halman — and now reside in the monolith's computational matrix, to infect the monolith with a computer virus retrieved from pico vault, a special containment facility on the moon used to house various chemical, biological, and cybernetic weapons in an attempt to avert a potential apocalypse. just as the humans feared, the monolith does indeed receive orders to exterminate humankind, and it begins to duplicate itself many hundreds of millions of times over. these millions of monoliths assemble themselves into two separate screens in front of the sun to prevent all light and heat from reaching the earth and its colonies. the intent is to shut down the entire terrestrial biosphere. however, halman had already infected the monolith with the virus at the time it began duplicating itself, and fifteen minutes after the screens are formed, all the monoliths disintegrate, including tma-0 and tma-1. halman manages to upload its combined personalities into a petabyte-capacity holographic 3d storage medium and thus survives the disintegration of the monoliths. however, that medium is infected with the virus in the process and is subsequently sealed by human scientists in pico vault, where it will presumably be stored until such time as humans (or others) choose to disinfect and revive it. at the close of the story, poole and the other humans land on europa and attempt to start peaceful relations with the primitive native europans. apparently, the creators of the monoliths - having long since evolved into a noncorporeal and godlike state of existence - had been watching humanity. they decide to grant the human race a reprieve, and that they will not determine humanity's fate until "the last days". ||| 5 ||| 5

in november 1963, shortly after the assassination of john f. kennedy, peter miller, a german freelance crime reporter, follows an ambulance to the apartment of salomon tauber, a jewish holocaust-survivor who has committed suicide. the next day, miller is given the dead man's diary by a friend in the police. after reading tauber's life story and learning that tauber had been in riga ghetto commanded by eduard roschmann, "the butcher of riga", miller resolves to search for roschmann. miller's attention is especially drawn to one diary passage in which tauber describes having seen roschmann shoot a german army captain who was wearing an unusual military decoration. miller pursues the story and visits the state attorney general's office and other offices where he learns that no one is prepared to search for or prosecute former nazis. but his investigations take him to the famed war-criminal investigator simon wiesenthal, who tells him about the society "odessa". miller is approached by a group of mossad agents who have vowed to search for german war criminals and kill them and have been attempting to infiltrate odessa. miller is asked to infiltrate odessa and agrees. a former ss member who is working with the team of israeli agents trains him to pass for a former ss sergeant. miller visits a lawyer working for odessa and after passing a severe scrutiny is sent to meet a passport forger who supplies those members who wish to escape. slowly miller unravels the entire system. but miller's identity has been compromised, in part by his ill-advised decision to use his own car; the impoverished ss man he is impersonating would not have been able to afford a sports car, and odessa sets its top hit man on miller's trail. miller escapes one trap by sheer luck; the hit man then installs a bomb in miller's car, but because the sports car has a very stiff suspension the bomb is not triggered while miller is driving it. eventually miller confronts roschmann at gunpoint and forces him to read from tauber's diary. roschmann admits to killing the german army captain, now revealed to have been miller's father, and attempts to justify his actions. miller tells roschmann that he doesn't care about roschmann's jewish victims; he is there to avenge the death of his father. miller, momentarily off guard, is disarmed and knocked unconscious by another odessa man who leaves in miller's car but is killed when he drives over a snow-covered pole and detonates the bomb. roschmann manages to escape, eventually flying to argentina. the hit man who has been sent to kill miller is instead killed by an israeli agent. while miller is recovering in hospital, he is told what happened while he was unconscious. josef, his contact, warns him not to tell anyone the story. he does disclose that with roschmann (code-named "vulkan") in argentina, west german authorities (at the urging of the israelis) will close roschmann's radio factory where a rocket guidance system is being secretly developed for the egyptian army. odessa's plan to obliterate the state of israel by combining german technological know-how with egyptian biological weapons has been thwarted. josef, in reality uri ben shaul, an israeli army officer, returns to israel to be debriefed, and performs one final duty. he has taken tauber's diary with him and per the last request in the diary, uri visits yad vashem and says kaddish for the soul of salomon tauber. ||| 6 ||| 6
subtitled "a memoir of a better era," north's book is a prose poem to adolescent angst. rascal chronicles young sterling's loving yet distant relationship with his father, dreamer david willard north, and the aching loss represented by the death of his mother, elizabeth nelson north. (the book also touches on young sterling's concerns for his older brother herschel, who is in europe fighting in world war one). the boy reconnects with society through the unlikely intervention of his pet raccoon, a "ringtailed wonder" charmer that dominates almost every page. the book begins with the capture of the baby raccoon, and follows his growth to a yearling. the story is also a personal chronicle of the era of change between the (nearly) untouched forest wilderness and agriculture; between the days of the pioneers and the rise of towns; and between horse-drawn transportation and automobiles, among other transitions. the author's through-a-boy's-eyes view of his observations during expeditions in and around his home town, contrasted with his father's reminiscences of the time "when wisconsin was still half wilderness, when panthers sometimes looked in through the windows, and the whippoorwills called all night long", provide a glimpse of the past, as the original subtitle suggests. the book is filled with humorous moments. his sister theo cannot understand sterling's building of a canoe in the living room and is "startled nearly out of her wits" when rascal, who had been lying on and blending into uncle justus' amazonian jaguar rug, stands up. later in the book, rascal joins him in a pie eating contest, and they win, but are disqualified, although his friend, oscar sunderland, takes first prize because of it. rascal also enjoyed riding in his bicycle's basket, and helped him sell magazines by creating an animated sideshow. the book also has serious moments. the author's brother herschel is serving in the military during world war i, and sterling longs for a word from him. rascal is confined after he bites an annoying lad who snaps him with a rubber band. later, sterling catches a mild case of the spanish flu during the epidemic. (it is stated in the book that his aunt lillie, who took care of him during his sickness, said that sterling's mother had wanted him to be a writer, which he achieved.) eventually the problems with rascal's raids into fields and henhouses become too much of an issue; the neighbors' irritation with the boy's pet can no longer be ignored. in addition, rascal has become a young adult and, as such, is getting attention from jealous male and interested female raccoons. sterling realizes that rascal is a wild animal and can no longer be kept, unless always kept in a cage. he travels in the newly completed canoe to release rascal in the woods at the far side of the nearby lake. the author's sister, the straight-laced poet and art historian jessica nelson north, is one note of early 1900s normalcy in the book. she wasn't particularly pleased with how her brother portrayed her family in rascal (yet was proud of her brother's achievement, regardless). the theme of rascal is not friendship, but loss, and the transcendence of it. sterling loses his mother, the attention of his father, his brother to war, and eventually his best friend, rascal, but survives and learns from it. ||| 0 ||| 0
in the novel, "young" humans (i.e. recreations of the medieval originals) are transported through the big collapse at the end of time to seed the next cycle of the universe. they are transported to hegira, an artificial environment of the scale of the planet jupiter which has habitats for several species on its surface. the habitats are protected and uncoupled from the universe's entropy by means of force fields projected by giant obelisks. in the human realm these are inscribed with the recorded history of humankind, sorted chronologically from the bottom up, including the science that went with it. people try to understand and copy what they can read on the obelisks, using balloons in some places to reach higher points on the obelisks. a legend tells the protagonist that his beloved (frozen in stasis) will awaken if he goes on quest to the rim walls of the habitat, so he does. on the way he lands on an island with a good view of an obelisk (at least high) which is just tumbling down in the distance. its fall causes a tsunami and devastates a continent. after the devastation, the inscriptions at the top of the fallen obelisk about human history are revealed. the hero's quest to the rim succeeds. he makes contact with an artificial intelligence guardian of hegira who tells him the story and advises him to go and populate the new universe, having become part of the last one. ||| 5 ||| 5
the novel is a fantasy alternate history combining vampires, the medicis, and the convoluted english politics surrounding edward iv and richard iii. the book also fictionalizes the fate of the princes in the tower. edward iv is on the throne of england, but in this alternate world, medieval europe is dominated by the threat from the byzantine empire. during the third century ce, julian the apostate reigned longer than he did in our world, succeeded in displacing christianity and reintroduced religious pluralism within the roman empire, resulting in the subsequent disappearance of islam as well. without any cohesive threat from the east, presumably byzantium was able to survive, consolidate its authority and expand. sforza, the vampire duke, marshals his forces for his long-planned attack on florence, and byzantium is on the march. a mercenary, the exiled heir to the byzantine throne, a young woman physician forced to flee florence, and a welsh wizard, the nephew of owain gly dwr, seem to have no common goals but together they wage an intrigue-filled campaign against the might of byzantium, striving to secure the english throne for richard, duke of gloucester, and make him richard iii. this succeeds, and richard iii goes on to win the battle of bosworth in this alternate universe, killing henry tudor and insuring that he never becomes henry vii as he did in our world. at that point, the book ends. ||| 2 ||| 2

kolbert visits shishmaref and fairbanks, alaska, to speak with both the townspeople and scientists about the effect global warming is having in alaska. in shishmaref, towns are being forced off of the coastal regions because ice that had once protected these towns from storms and large waves, have melted. in fairbanks kolbert met with scientist vladimir romanovsky to study how global warming is affecting the permafrost levels in alaska. romanovsky’s research shows that as permafrost melts it releases carbon dioxide, which has been trapped in the permafrost for thousands of years and is harmful to the environment. kolbert also discusses the spectrometer used by donald perovich on the expedition, des groseilliers. the spectrometer was used to measure the light reflected off of the ice and snow. the discovery that the snow reflected more than the ocean is important because the ocean is being heated by global warming and melting the ice which is making the water levels rise. this section explains the history of researchers exploring human influence on climate change. at the beginning, it states that global warming is not a fad because it has been researched since the mid-19th century. john tyndall was the first to research global warming; he did this by creating the first spectrophotometer. this is an instrument used to measure the absorptive properties of gases. through his research of gases, he discovered what is today called “the greenhouse effect.” the greenhouse effect is the absorption and retention of heat from radiation. after the death of john tyndall, svante arrhenius took over his position as the main researcher of global warming. he was the first to connect industrialization to climate change and even today nasa scientists credit him with insightful predictions: “his understanding of the role of carbon dioxide in heating earth, even at that early date, led him to predict that if atmospheric carbon dioxide doubled, earth would become several degrees warmer.” after the death of arrhenius, most scientists believed that if levels were rising at all, they were rising very slowly. in the mid-1950s, charles david keeling found a more precise way to record levels and began recording the data. he brought us the keeling curve which shows the steady rise of levels since 1958. kolbert travels to a research station in greenland called swiss camp that was set up in 1990 and built into the ice floes. kolbert meets konrad steffan, the director of swiss camp, who studies the meteorological conditions on the ice sheets at the equilibrium line (the point at which winter snow and summer snow melt are supposed to be exactly in balance). steffan’s research shows that the glaciers have been melting faster (at a rate of 12 cubic miles per year), creating much more flooding in the area during the warmer months. these glaciers contain vast amounts of fresh water, which, when melted into the salt water of the oceans, begins to change ocean current patterns, thus resulting in some places around the world becoming colder and some becoming warmer. from obtaining ice cores from the greenland ice sheet, it has been found that the average temperatures have risen twenty degrees within the past ten years thus resulting in the beginning of the disintegration of the entire greenland ice sheet, which will be impossible to stop. it has also been found that rapid warming has occurred in the past, which then proceeded to fall into ice age conditions. in november 2004, there was a study presented in reykjavik, iceland, that explained how the arctic climate is warming and the u.s. responded by stating they would effectively take action to combat the problem but would not make it an obligation. the scientists studying the situation have seen how humans have become the dominating factor in influencing climate change; in the professional world, global warming is not necessarily thought to be a natural process. this chapter describes kolbert's interviews with scientists from around the world who have conducted experiments to prove that climate change inevitably affects many organisms' genetic structures and habitats. kolbert attempts to reveal that global warming is the cause for these events. she interviews three biologists, chris thomas, william bradshaw and christina holzapfel, and one paleoecologist, thomas web iii. kolbert follows scientific observations based upon the studies of the comma butterfly, the mosquito wyeomyia smithii, the golden toad and pollen grains, among many other studies. kolbert is concerned with the frightening reality that if species are being genetically changed and on the verge of extinction that the availability of our natural resources for future will be in jeopardy. kolbert visits giss, a former branch of nasa, which analyzes and produces various geographic models to demonstrate the behavior of the atmosphere, land surfaces, and ice sheets. according to giss, more and more droughts are being triggered, which we aren’t able to adapt to with our way of living. this problem also arose in ancient civilizations, such as with the mayans and in the city of shekhna, when they reached their technological peak. the ancient city of shekhna in present-day syria has shown evidence that the culture died from drought. kolbert cites scientific evidence based on geological models that chart the geographic downfall of other ancient civilizations that have experienced climate change. during ancient times, however, the technology had yet to be developed and they did not have the proper scientific abilities to adapt to extreme changes like massive drought. kolbert argues that we may be technologically advanced, but as we continue to progress, we are becoming more and more destructive to the environment as well. in chapter six, kolbert visits the netherlands where the dutch have made many provisions to prevent the increasing problem of widespread flooding. water-ministry official eelke turkstra predicts that the nieuwe merwede canal will rise several feet above the local dikes around 2100 due to the flooding. the two main problems are caused by warming water that leads to expansion and raises the sea level, another is due to precipitation changes produced by a warming earth. turkstra believes that instead of building more dikes, the existing dikes should be dismantled to make room for the rising water. he wants to buy polders (land that has been laboriously reclaimed from the water) from farmers and lower surrounding dikes around them to create more area for the rising water. then, kolbert talks to dura vermeer who creates amphibious homes which will float on the water if a flood were to occur. kolbert interviews robert socolow, the co-director for the carbon mitigation initiative, about bau or “business as usual”, which is a future in which current emissions trends continue without being checked. socolow came up with a plan to help keep carbon emissions down but in order for his plans to work they must start taking effect as soon as possible. socolow’s plan consisted of a fifteen point system where each point, known as a “stabilization wedge”, would reduce carbon emission by one billion metric tons a year. the wedges consisted of finding alternative fuel sources such as wind, solar and nuclear power, along with developing new technology and upgrading current technology to reduce carbon emission. socolow argues that the government needs to get involved in order help motivate people to lower carbon emissions. kolbert also interviews marty hoffert, professor of physics at new york university. hoffert believes that in order to fight global warming, people have to come up with new ways to generate power without producing carbon. this can be achieved, as he proposes, through satellite solar power (ssp). ssp means collecting solar energy using orbiting satellites which beam the power to ground using microwaves for collection by a rectenna. energy can be transferred to earth 24 hours a day without interference from clouds or nightfall. hoffert also argues that we must change our view on global warming and divert from the bau or else our civilization will not last. the kyoto protocol, active as of february 16, 2005, is a worldwide effort between nations to control greenhouse gas emissions. it began in 1992 and was supported by the u.s. president george h.w. bush, who attended the u.n. framework convention where the u.s. agreed, along with other annex 1 countries (china, canada, japan and nations of europe included), to “return their emissions to 1990 levels,” or below. clinton, succeeding president to bush, also supported the protocol, but emission levels kept rising and not much was accomplished during his term. the bush administration pulled the u.s. out of kyoto in 2001 (it was one of only two nations to do so), where george w. bush, who once promised solutions for controlling co2 emissions during his campaign, now took a different stand that no longer supported kyoto because, as he said to the public, the “state of scientific knowledge of the causes of, and solutions to, global climate change”, are “incomplete”. greenhouse gases are increasing rapidly (20% since 1990) and the us accounts for 34% of annex 1 emissions. since 2000, the bush administration began using a “greenhouse gas intensity system”, which measures the ratio of emissions to economic output as a way of measuring emissions as a whole. kolbert argues that the system is misleading and favors industrial development because while greenhouse gas levels are actually rising, according to this system they are supposedly falling. according to kolbert, the improper feed of information to the public is also supplement by books and web groups funded by huge corporations such as exxon mobil and general motors, who are giving out information contradicting proven and alarming scientific evidence about global warming. articles produced are falsely stating, among many things, that weather can’t be predicted ahead of time, global warming isn’t real and hasn’t been proven, or that a warming climate is something to celebrate. kolbert writes about burlington, vermont’s largest city. years ago, the citizens decided to stand up to global warming by using less power instead of buying more. the mayor of burlington, peter clavelle, who has been mayor since 1989, came up with a program that encourages contractors to engage not in demolition but in “deconstruction”. this helps the city save energy by reducing waste and cutting down the need for new materials. burlington’s electric department (bed) has a wind turbine that provided enough power for thirty homes and gets half of its energy from renewable sources, such as its 50 megawatt power plant that runs off of wood chips. the bed also leases compact fluorescent light bulbs for twenty cents a month because a family who uses these bulbs can cut their electricity bill by 10 percent. the city of burlington estimates that their energy saving projects over the course of this lifetime will prevent the release of 175,000 tons of carbon. burlington residents also eat locally and have turned old waste sites into an assortment of community gardens and cooperatives, the waste from these gardens is taken to a composting factory, and turned back into soil, making this process a “closed loop”. clavelle’s plan has begun to pick up across america beginning with greg nickles, the mayor of seattle, who created a set of principles called the “us mayors climate protection agreement”. this agreement has been signed by over a hundred and seventy mayors, representing about thirty – six million people. this agreement is trying to prove how much can be done at the local level and clavelle hopes that more cities will adopt this plan. governor arnold schwarzenegger of california later issued an executive order to drastically reduce california's greenhouse gas emissions. kolbert wraps up the book's main ideas by introducing a few new ideas and themes about climate change that had not been previously mentioned. the chapter starts out saying that modern humans are one of the primary influences on our environment and that we are entering an era aptly named the “anthropocene” — the age of homo sapiens. kolbert also discusses the impacts and discovery of chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs. most of what she discusses about cfcs in this chapter is based around the discovery of their negative impact on our ozone layer and the fact that this discovery only came about by accident. kolbert also writes that we as a species can either come together to survive, or protect our self-interests as earth’s climate continues to spiral out of our control. as kolbert points out at the end of the chapter, if nothing changes in the way society looks at climate change, the world will tear itself apart. there is proof of this today, as entire countries evacuate due to severe weather changes, or others fight to control major resources such as food, water, and shelter. as people living in developed countries, we often take these basic needs for granted and do not realize how precious they really are. ||| 4 ||| 4
a young cambridge university professor, horace holly, is visited by a colleague, vincey, who reveals that he will soon die and proceeds to tell holly a fantastical tale of his family heritage. he charges holly with the task of raising his young son, leo (whom he has never seen) and gives holly a locked iron box, with instructions that it is not to be opened until leo turns 25. holly agrees, and indeed vincey is found dead the next day. holly raises the boy as his own; when the box is opened on leo's 25th birthday they discover the ancient and mysterious "sherd of amenartas", which seems to corroborate leo's father's story. holly, leo and their servant, job, follow instructions on the sherd and travel to eastern africa but are shipwrecked. they alone survive, together with their arab captain, mahomed; after a perilous journey into an uncharted region of the african interior, they are captured by the savage amahagger people. the adventurers learn that the natives are ruled by a fearsome white queen, who is worshiped as hiya or "she-who-must-be-obeyed". the amahagger are curious about the white-skinned interlopers, having been warned of their coming by the mysterious queen. billali, the chief elder of one of the amahagger tribes, takes charge of the three men, introducing them to the ways of his people. one of the amahagger maidens, ustane, takes a liking to leo and during a tribal feast sings lovingly to him. billali tells holly that he needs to go and report the white men's arrival to she, but in his absence, some of the amahagger become restless and seize mahomed, intending to eat him as part of a ritual "hotpot". realising what is about to happen, holly shoots several of the armahagger, killing mahomed in the process; in the ensuing struggle leo is gravely wounded, but the three englishmen are saved when billali returns in the nick of time and declares that they are under the protection of she. as leo's condition worsens, he approaches death although tended by ustane. they are taken to the home of the queen, which lies near the ruins of the lost city of kôr, a once mighty civilization which predated the egyptians. the queen and her retinue lives under a dormant volcano in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of kôr. there, holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named ayesha. her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. she, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. when she shows herself, however, holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. ayesha reveals that she has learned secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, a form of telegnosis and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably unable to see into the future. she tells holly that she has lived in the realm of kôr for over two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage). after she veils herself again, holly remembers leo and begs ayesha to visit his ward. having agreed, she is stunned upon seeing him, as she believes him to be the reincarnation of kallikrates. later, when holly secretly follows ayesha to a hidden chamber he learns that she may also have some degree of power to reanimate the dead. she heals leo, but becomes jealous of the girl, ustane. the latter is ordered to leave the home of she-who-must-be-obeyed but refuses, and is eventually struck dead by ayesha's power. despite the murder of their friend, holly and leo cannot free themselves from the power of ayesha's beauty. they remain amongst the tombs as leo recovers his strength, and ayesha lectures holly on the ancient history of kôr. ayesha shows leo the perfectly preserved body of kallikrates, which she has kept with her, but she then dissolves the remains with a powerful acid, confident that leo is indeed the reincarnation of her former lover. in the climax of the novel, ayesha takes the two men to see the pillar of fire, passing through the ruined city of kôr and into the heart of the ancient volcano. she is determined that leo should bathe in the fire to become immortal and remain with her forever, and that together they can become the immortal and all-powerful rulers of the world. after a perilous journey, they come to a great cavern, but at the last leo doubts the safety of entering the flame. to allay his fears, ayesha steps into the spirit of life, but with this second immersion, the life-preserving power is lost and ayesha begins to revert to her true age. holly speculates that it may be that a second exposure undoes the effects of the previous or the spirit of life spews death on occasion. before their eyes, ayesha withers away in the fire, and her body shrinks. the sight is so shocking that job dies in fright. before dying, she tells leo, "i die not. i shall come again." *horace holly - protagonist and narrator, holly is a cambridge don whose keen intellect and knowledge was developed to compensate for his ape-like appearance. holly knows a number of ancient languages, including greek, arabic, and hebrew, which allow him to communicate with the amahagger (who speak a form of arabic) and she (who knows all three languages). holly's interest in archaeology and the origins of civilization lead him to explore the ruins of kor. *leo vincey - ward of horace holly, leo is an attractive, physically active young english gentleman with a thick head of blond hair. he is the confidant of holly and befriends ustane. according to she, leo resembles kallikrates in appearance and is his reincarnation. *ayesha - the title character of the novel, called hiya by the native amahagger, or "she". ayesha was born over 2,000 years ago amongst the arabs, mastering the lore of the ancients and becoming a great sorceress. learning of the pillar of life in the african interior, she journeyed to the ruined kingdom of kôr, feigning friendship with a hermit who was the keeper of the flame that granted immortality. she bathed in the pillar of life's fire. *job - holly's trusted servant. job is a working-class man and highly suspicious and judgmental of non-english peoples. he is also a devout protestant. of all the travellers, he is especially disgusted by the amahagger and fearful of she. *billali - an elder of one of the amahagger tribes. *ustane - an amahagger maiden. she becomes romantically attached to leo, caring for him when he is injured, acting as his protector, and defying she to stay with him. *kallikrates - an ancient greek, the husband of amenartas, and ancestor of leo. two thousand years ago, he and amenartas fled egypt, seeking a haven in the african interior where they met ayesha. there, she fell in love with him, promising to give him the secret of immortality if he would kill amenartas. he refused, and enraged she struck him down. *amenartas - an ancient egyptian priestess and ancestress of the vincey family. as a priestess of isis, she was protected from the power of she. when ayesha slew kallikrates, she expelled amenartas from her realm. amenartas gave birth to kallikrates' son, beginning the line of the vinceys (leo's ancestors). ||| 2 ||| 2
during an unusual attempt on his life, vlad prays to his goddess verra for aid and surprisingly receives it. as payment, verra requests that vlad kill the king of greenaere, an island kingdom off the coast of the empire, where magic does not work. vlad agrees and sails to greenaere, where he completes the assassination without difficulty. fleeing the island, however, proves more difficult. after fighting off some guards, an injured vlad stumbles upon a drummer in the forest named aibynn who tends his wounds and tries to cover for him when more guards arrive. vlad faints from aibynn's dreamgrass and reveals his hidden location, causing the guards to arrest both of them. in prison, vlad talks with aibynn, who thinks of nothing but drumming, and waits for an opportunity to escape. eventually he learns that loiosh had flown across the ocean to warn their friends. aliera and cawti arrive at the prison and free vlad using elder sorcery, which does not require a link to the orb. vlad brings aibynn along, though he suspects that he might be a spy. morrolan provides a boat and the group sails away. back in adrilankha, vlad is still stuck between the jhereg organization and his wife's group of easterner and teckla revolutionists. vlad's superior warns him that members of the council are displeased with the situation. matters worsen when greenaere declares war on the empire and press gangs begin forcibly recruiting easterners. a watchtower in south adrilankha is destroyed, and most of the high-ranking revolutionists are arrested, including cawti. vlad suspects that the jhereg are involved in the arrest. after threatening the jhereg representative at the capital, vlad pursues boralinoi, the council member whose territory includes vlad's and south adrilankha. boralinoi confirms that he framed the revolutionists and a fight breaks out in his office. vlad escapes, but knows that the council will be targeting him for assassination. he is summoned before the empress and convinces her to have cawti released. on the palace steps, vlad and cawti acknowledge that cawti has changed and they no longer love each other. vlad goes to south adrilankha to visit his grandfather, whom he calls noish-pa, at his shop. after a heartfelt conversation about vlad's growing self-doubt, noish-pa warns vlad of an assassin waiting outside the shop. vlad exits the shop and kills the assassin with the help of loiosh. as he flees the murder scene, vlad becomes aware of a menacing charge in the south adrilankha residents. after vlad stumbles upon a slain phoenix guard, a riot breaks out. vlad remembers only short flashes of the violence, but mostly avoids taking part in it. he makes his way back to noish-pa, who has killed several phoenix guards but allowed a female soldier to escape. vlad convinces noish-pa to teleport with him to safety at castle black. at castle black, morrolan tells vlad that the riot turned into a revolt, including a short siege on the imperial palace. cawti has been arrested again, this time for treason. while angered by the empire's brutal suppression of the revolt, vlad is agonized by the inevitable execution cawti faces. he visits the empress again and strikes a deal: he will testify to boralinoi's framing of cawti before the orb and single-handedly end the war with greenaere in exchange for the pardon of cawti and her the revolutionists. by testifying, vlad commits the ultimate sin in the organization, ending his career and branding him for death. testifying in public, "under the orb," (which can detect falsehoods) is what ultimately sets the jhereg council against him. his previous acts of threatening the lives of his immediate superior in the jhereg, toronnan, and his boss' boss, lord boralinoi, as well as the jhereg representative at court, count soffta, got the jhereg to put out a (non-morganti) contract on him but, given the nature of the organization, vlad would have been "forgiven" had he "won" his war. but nobody gives open evidence about the jhereg in public, much less in testimony before the empress, and lives (except, it seems, vlad). after his testimony, the contract is revised to be executed with a morganti weapon, which would destroy vlad's soul forever. vlad executes his second obligation with the help of his dragaeran friends. together they penetrate greenaere's magic barrier and teleport outside the greenaere throne room. vlad negotiates a peace treaty during a tense stand-off, but the new king wants vengeance on the one responsible for ordering his father killed. vlad knows that this last stipulation is impossible, but sends the treaty to the empress. vlad offers himself to the king, but before he can be executed, the empress has boralinoi sent back, claiming him

the novel is set against the background of the civil rights act conflict in the johnson administration. at the beginning of the book, paul whipple, a black character from the earlier novel too many cooks (1938), whose trust wolfe had gained against a strong west virginia atmosphere of prejudice, comes to tell wolfe that wolfe has since become his hero, and that he has also achieved the dream, stated in the earlier novel, of becoming an anthropologist. he has come, however, to draw upon the favor he did wolfe 26 years earlier, by asking wolfe to prevent his son dunbar whipple from marrying a rich white girl, susan brooke, with whom he is apparently in love. while denying that he is not opposed, in principle at least, to mixed-race couples, paul whipple thinks that sensible rich white girls do not fall in love with poor black men, even if the rich white girl is working for a black civil rights organization in new york, the rights of citizens committee. wolfe is loath to interfere in the matter, but agrees to at least learn what he can about the true motivations of the socialite girlfriend and why she would be interested in a negro boyfriend to settle the debt he owes whipple. before the real mystery story gets underway, stout allows some give and take on the concept of racism being a two-way street: blacks preferring their own as much as whites. archie arranges a meeting with susan brooke through his girlfriend lily rowan, but is unable to form a conclusion as to her motives. wolfe has him fly to racine, wisconsin, susan's hometown, to do research on her background. he discovers little except for an incident where a man who wanted to marry her, richard ault, shot himself on her front porch after she turned him down. he is doing more research when wolfe suddenly calls him back to new york: susan brooke has been brutally murdered in her harlem apartment. dunbar whipple is the prime suspect for the murder, and wolfe agrees to work on his behalf. wolfe focuses his investigation on dunbar and susan's co-workers at the rights of citizens committee over the objections of whipple's lawyer harold oster, who is also the rocc's counsel. those interviewed include the organization's founder thomas henchly, susan's superior cass faison, rae kallmann and maud jordan, two white volunteers, and beth tiger, a black stenographer archie takes immediate interest in. susan's family is also interviewed, and it becomes apparent that they are bigots who consider her involvement with civil rights a "kink" and do not believe she could have been engaged to dunbar. her sister-in-law dolly is particularly vitriolic and archie takes an instant dislike to her. the family claims that susan was actually engaged to a white car dealer named paul vaughan. saul panzer discovers that dolly brooke lied about her alibi the night of the murder by interviewing a garage attendant who saw her take her car out an hour before the murder took place. they cannot prove it because the witness refuses to testify, but stumble upon a lucky break when paul vaughn, riddled with guilt, confesses to archie that he lied to the police to firm up dolly's alibi. mrs. brooke is confronted and admits that she went to susan's apartment, but she could not get in because no one answered her knock. this indicates that susan was already dead at 8:45, long before dunbar whipple arrived at the apartment. her evidence clears him, but wolfe elects not to use it because that would not only endanger his source, paul vaughan, but would complicate matters by destroying the lead he has on the police. several days later, vaughan calls archie, telling him that he may have more information but that he has to do some checking on it first. the next day he is found dead, shot multiple times. when it emerges that vaughan went to the rocc the day before for information on susan and dunbar, wolfe brings the key players to his office for another interview to prevent them from being arrested as material witnesses. it is during this interview that wolfe realizes that the key to the case lies in the unusual frequency of a diphthong in the names of those involved. it will take another trip to the midwest for archie (this time to evansville, indiana) before the case is solved. the use of paul whipple as a character in a 1964 nero wolfe novel was problematic, since rex stout never allowed his recurring characters to age. whipple was a young man in too many cooks, but had aged 26 years and was a middle-aged academic in a right to die. in all this time, nero wolfe and archie goodwin miraculously remained the same age, but whipple never noticed or mentioned this oddity. ||| 6 ||| 6

in the future, humankind has tried to develop artificial intelligence, succeeding only once, and then disastrously. a transmission from the project site on an island in the puget sound, "rogue consciousness!", was followed by slaughter and destruction, culminating in the island vanishing from the face of the earth. the current project is being run on the moon, and the book tells the story of the seventh attempt in a series of experiments to create an artificial consciousness. for each attempt the scientists raise a group of clones. these clones are kept isolated and raised to believe that they will be the crew of a spaceship that will colonize a planet in the tau ceti solar system (tau ceti has no habitable planet, its choice - should they manage to reach it - is part of the planned frustration of the crew). the spaceship will take hundreds of years to reach the system and the crew will spend most of their time in hibernation. along with the crew of six, the ship carries thousands of other clones in hibernation, intended to populate the new colony and, if necessary, provide replacements for any crew members who die along the way. the crew are just caretakers: the ship is controlled by a disembodied human brain, called "organic mental core" or "omc", that runs the complex operations of the vessel and keeps it moving in space. but the first two omc's (myrtle and little joe) become catatonic, while the third omc goes insane and kills two of the umbilicus crew members. the crew are left with only one choice: to build an artificial consciousness that will enable the ship to continue. the crew knows that if they attempt to turn back they will be ordered to abort (self destruct). the clones have been bred and carefully selected for psychological purposes to reinforce each other, as well as to provide various specialized skills that will give them the best chance of success. the crew includes a chaplain-psychiatrist, raja flattery, who knows their real purpose, and that the breakdown of the "omc"s was planned. he's aware that six other ships have gone out before theirs, each one failing. he understands the nature of the test: create a high pressure environment in which brilliance may break through out of necessity, and create in the safety of the void what humans couldn't safely create on earth. space ship earthling number seven ultimately succeeds, and the consequences of their success form the basis of the plot for the novels which follow. fr:destination vide he:destination: void ||| 5 ||| 5

the delivery boy from the first book, who is now the avatar, must stop an epic clash of civilizations between the western world, led by christian extremist general horatio cruz, and the middle east, led by muslim extremist al-zee. to accomplish this task, the avatar decides to find the "prime influencer", a person who, he feels, can indirectly influence all the decisions people make by virtue of responsibility, from fashion to the election of the president. he attempts to do so by enlisting a talented and arrogant programmer at global information corporation (gic) (an all-encompassing, worldwide future sort of tia created out of fear of terrorism) to analyze gic's massive databases using software. also, people's phones are, in the name of preventing terrorist communications, restricted to only calling certain contacts a person has that have been approved by the department of communications; this fact ultimately comes back in the book's climax. the avatar applies his unparalleled ability to identify developing patterns and accurately determine the most probable outcomes of a situation to accurately predict the war plans of both cruz and al-zee. he subsequently uses his ability to recognize even the vaguest patterns (which makes him seem to know more than he actually does) to bypass guards, escape interrogations, and ultimately win an audience with the warring leaders. ultimately, the avatar fails to stop the onset of the war. however, at the conclusion of the book, the prime influencer, who turns out to be an opinionated café owner that the avatar had met previously by chance, launches a simple, yet catchy, phrase (if god is so smart, why do you fart?) that spreads throughout the world like a virus thanks to an advanced computer worm, named giver-of-data (god), launched by the gic programmer shortly before his death, which unlocked everyone's phones, linked them up to automatic translation systems, and disabled call billing. according to the story, "once you heard it, you could never forget it." it was this phrase that finally captured the collective imaginations of ordinary people, causing them to reevaluate their assumptions about the nature of god. this ultimately led to the elimination of fundamentalist religious practices throughout the world, which, in turn, resulted in the end of the religion war. ||| 5 ||| 5

sarah and barry rackham have been married less than four years. she is a wealthy heiress, while he is neither employed nor of independent means. mrs. rackham has recently cut off mr. rackham's allowance due to his escalating demands, and yet he continues to spend considerable sums of money. mrs. rackham, along with her cousin calvin leeds, comes to the brownstone to engage wolfe: she wants to know where her husband is getting his money. reluctantly, wolfe takes the case. the next day a carton, delivered to his brownstone and thought to contain sausage, turns out to contain a canister of tear gas, which discharges when the carton is opened. shortly thereafter, arnold zeck phones. zeck heads an organized crime syndicate, insulates himself from publicity by means of several layers of subordinates, and has figured in two of wolfe's recent cases. now he calls wolfe to stress that the carton of tear gas could have contained an explosive, and that wolfe should withdraw from the work he is performing for mrs. rackham. wolfe hangs up on zeck. it now seems likely that zeck is the source of barry rackham's income. as arranged with mrs. rackham, archie visits her country home in westchester, ostensibly to investigate a dog poisoning for leeds, who breeds dobermans. his actual purpose is to develop an acquaintance with mr. rackham. over dinner that night, archie picks up information on several guests, family members and staff. leeds is to some degree dependent on his cousin for his livelihood: mrs. rackham has allowed him to set up a kennels on a corner of her property. mrs. rackham's secretary, lina darrow, amuses herself by flirting with some of the men present, including oliver pierce, a state assemblyman. dana hammond, a banker, is trying to establish a closer relationship with mrs. rackham's widowed daughter-in-law, annabel frey. archie also has an opportunity to size up barry rackham. although archie initially expected that rackham would turn out to be a gigolo who got lucky, he is actually a very clever man, whose interactions with his wife show real character. after dinner and television, rackham pointedly implies that he knows what archie's doing there, and just as pointedly urges him to leave early the next morning. later that night, mrs. rackham and her pet doberman are found stabbed to death in the woods near her house. archie phones wolfe to report and, after dealing with the local officials, returns to manhattan to confer further with wolfe. when he arrives at the brownstone, archie finds the front door ajar, fritz and theodore in confusion, and wolfe gone. a brief note, inarguably from wolfe, instructs archie not to look for him. wolfe's disappearance touches off other events. first, a gazette employee wants to authenticate an order for an advertisement, which announces wolfe's retirement from the detective business. then marko vukcic, wolfe's oldest friend, tells archie that wolfe came to see him at 2:00 a.m. that morning. marko spoke with wolfe for an hour, and has information for archie. the orchids are to be moved to lewis hewitt's nursery on long island, and marko will hire fritz to work at rusterman's. marko has wolfe's power of attorney, and will offer the brownstone for sale. finally, archie is to "act in the light of experience as guided by intelligence" – his standing instructions when wolfe is not available to provide specific direction. and archie is recalled to westchester. he took advantage of district attorney archer's imprecise instructions when he returned to manhattan, and now archer wants him back to clarify some points. further, archer wants to speak with wolfe. when archie tells him, truthfully, that he doesn't know where wolfe is, archer loses his temper and has archie jailed as a material witness. archie's cellmate is max christy, who was arrested earlier in a raid on an apparently unsavory establishment. christy takes an interest in archie and tries to recruit him for his organization – it goes unnamed, but from christy's very oblique description, it sounds criminal. for example, it regards the payment of income taxes as optional. and one of the reasons that christy thinks archie has potential is that he " . . . has been a private eye for years and so he would be open to anything that sounds good enough." archie does not commit himself, but he takes christy's phone number, and is annoyed that christy gets released before nathaniel parker, wolfe's lawyer, bails archie out. days pass, then weeks and months, with no word from wolfe. archie sets up shop for himself, of course as a private investigator. he gets a hint that wolfe is still alive, when marko has him prepare a check, drawn to cash and charged to travel expense. a log of some of archie's cases during this period suggests a much more quotidian professional life than he is accustomed to: finding a stolen cat, supervising workers at coney island, and catching a cashier dipping into the till. still, archie makes enough to cover his living expenses, and then some. he's getting ready to spend a month vacationing in norway with lily rowan when max christy shows up with an offer. christy wants archie to meet with someone – just possibly arnold zeck, archie guesses – to answer some questions. if archie's answers pass muster, he'll have a chance to " . . . dip into the biggest river of fast dough that ever flowed." out of curiosity, archie agrees to a meeting. that night, he joins a man in a chauffered car. it's not zeck, but a stranger named pete roeder. they drive around manhattan, discussing roeder's requirement: an expert tailing job on a man named rackham, and he wants archie to get saul panzer, fred durkin and orrie cather for the job. archie verifies that roeder means barry rackham, the one whose wife, wolfe's client, was murdered. rackham is the beneficiary of much of his wife's estate, and since her death he's been living well in a suite at the hotel churchill in manhattan. roeder won't tell archie specifically why he wants rackham tailed, but he's certain that archie can't turn the job down. as roeder smugly points out, archie was there when mrs. rackham was murdered, wolfe disappeared just six hours after archie phoned him, and archie was jailed as a material witness. now he's being offered the job of tailing rackham, for no apparent reason. how could he turn it down? he can't. archie wonders who it is that's after rackham. if it's zeck himself, or if roeder works for zeck, then rackham has somehow crossed zeck since the day when wolfe was told to lay off. if rackham is still under zeck's aegis, it would be dangerous to take a job tailing him for roeder and christy. either way, archie can't resist getting mixed up in it. so archie arranges with saul, fred and orrie to tail rackham. they will report daily to archie, who will then summarize rackham's activities for christy. archie confirms that both christy and roeder work in the zeck organization, and that the organization is worried about rackham. before his wife's death, rackham had been working for zeck, but quit when he became a wealthy widower. investigations into organized crime are ongoing in both washington and new york, and zeck's syndicate is worried that rackham is meeting with a da. roeder would like to rope rackham back in to participate in a new scheme he's developed, but first he needs to be sure that rackham hasn't turned informant. after more than a week of the tailing, rackham has figured out that he's being followed, and archie decides that he might as well have a chat with him to see if he can learn anything interesting. rackham is wild to know who wants him followed, and archie tells him it's zeck. rackham is so frantic that he throws his whisky glass against the wall. he offers archie $5,000 for further information. archie tells rackham about christy and roeder, and rackham tells archie he'll top any offer that roeder makes. archie reports this conversation to christy: he doesn't dare conceal it, because roeder might have other operatives watching rackham. archie's report apparently has an effect, for christy returns the next day to say that roeder wants to see him. a car and driver take them to westchester, the location of both the rackham estate and zeck's. upon arrival, archie is relieved of his gun and escorted into a small waiting room that resembles a fortified bunker. there he meets arnold zeck, whose appearance is intimidating: zeck tells archie that he needs good men, including some he can meet with and work through. archie might be one such, and zeck would like to try. he has roeder brought into the room. zeck explains that he and roeder want rackham frightened in order to ensure his cooperation with roeder's new operation, which requires a well-to-do man with good social connections. zeck closes the meeting by placing archie on the b list. back in manhattan, archie gets a message from rackham that he wants to meet. archie arrives at the suite just in time to see lina darrow leaving, and he sees that rackham has deteriorated during the last three days. his skin looks splotchy, his eyes are bloodshot, his muscles twitch, he needs a shave, his clothes are dirty and he's been drinking heavily. archie turns up the pressure on rackham by telling him that he has met with zeck. he adds that because zeck has evidence that will convict rackham of murdering his wife, archie can't help rackham without becoming an accessory after the fact. he urges rackham to assist in roeder's new operation: if he does, zeck might reciprocate by suppressing the evidence of rackham's guilt. rackham tacitly agrees, and archie makes arrangements for them to meet with zeck and roeder. but then the westchester authorities butt in and call archie to white plains for further questioning. there, he finds that lina darrow has provided more information. she has had an intimate relationship with rackham, but now he has refused to marry her. she has learned from him that wolfe told mrs. rackham over the phone that he had determined rackham's source of income – a criminal source – and that mrs. rackham then told her husband it had to stop. this gives rackham a motive, previously unknown to the police, for the murder. archie has been summoned to white plains to confirm what wolfe told mrs. rackham, and to answer for not having mentioned it earlier. but archie can't and won't do it. he says that miss darrow is lying, and it's not merely his word against hers. her story has wolfe phoning mrs. rackham just a few hours after she left his office – much too soon to have gathered so much information. and archie points out that the rackhams were getting along fine at dinner the next evening – not the way people behave when the wife tells her husband she's learned that he's a criminal. the da buys archie's version of events and lets him go, so archie is able to take rackham to meet with roeder and zeck after all. but the meeting turns into a bloodbath. ||| 6 ||| 6
following on from infinity welcomes careful drivers, lister, rimmer and the cat have discovered a cache of 'better than life' headbands in one of the sleeping quarters. they fantasise that they board the nova 5 and use its duality jump drive to return to earth. lister settles down with a woman who looks exactly like kristine kochanski in bedford falls, which looks exactly like the bedford falls in frank capra's it's a wonderful life, lister's favourite movie. he has two sons, jim and bexley, who are so intelligent they were able to change their own nappies. lister also opens a successful curry shop and every day is christmas eve. rimmer becomes the head of a multi-national corporation, rimmer corp., and has a 50 billion dollarpound fortune. he's married to juanita chicata, the most beautiful model and actress in the world, with a massively fiery temper. he's also developed a solidgram to give himself a real body and a time machine, which he uses to beat george patton, julius caesar and napoleon bonaparte at risk. the danish government gives cat an island, on which is built a giant golden castle, right out of a gothic fairy tale. the castle is surrounded by a moat of milk, and is staffed by , scantily clad valkyrie warriors. he likes to travel on firebreathing yaks and shoot dogs. back in reality, kryten is cajoled by holly to laser messages into lister's arms. lister feels the pain of this in bedford falls, and when he applies cold cream to the areas of pain, they spell two messages - 'u=btl' on his left arm and 'dying' on his right. eventually kryten is forced to enter the game to try to retrieve the crew, and his mechanoid brain allows him to remember entering. while searching for his shipmates, kryten accidentally wanders into a diner which is advertising for a dishwasher to work through an endless pile of dirty dishes. the next thing he knows, months have passed. meanwhile, the messages on his arm cause lister to realise that he is in the game and confronts rimmer. they travel to denmark and meet with the cat. while discussing how to get out. kryten arrives and explains how they started playing, and to leave they need only want to leave, but their subsequent attempts to escape fail because the game lures them in. their collective fantasies fall apart because of rimmer's massive self-loathing; even if he wants to stay, he hates himself so much that his mind has only built up his life so that it can bring him down later. he loses his fortune, has his body repossessed, and ends up in the body of a woman while trapped with a couple of violent convicts, forcing him to recognise that his own attitude towards women is disturbing; most of his groupies in the fantasy are women who rejected him in life, his first wife was actually his brother's wife in reality, and his second wife was his mother. upon attempting to leave, he can't, and realises that all four must leave together. he travels to bedford falls in a giant truck, accidentally wiping out the town square in the process, ruining lister's fantasy. they travel to denmark, to discover that cat's valkyries have gone on strike, the milk moat has curdled, and a volcano has started to erupt. the crew leave the game together. the next morning, lister wakes up and starts making breakfast, only to realize something is amiss. he didn't have to wait for the lifts on his way back, his alarm clock doesn't violently blare, his towel extends all the way around his waist. eventually lister drops his toast and it lands butter-side up, confirming his fears that he's still in the game. the rest of the crew enter and announce they've found statis units containing rimmer, kochanski and petersen, only for lister to tell them the bad news. at this point, the creator of the game appears and offers them a replay. they decline, and finally return to reality. due to their having not moved for such a long time, lister and cat's muscles have atrophied considerably, and they have to be placed in special suits for some time to re-hydrate and restore their muscles. while lister and the cat recover, kryten and rimmer realise holly has shut himself off and the ship's engines are dead. his companion, a novelty appliance named talkie toaster, convinced the computer to perform a dangerous repair operation which lead to holly having a five digit iq, but has less than two minutes of run time left, forcing him to shut himself down. to make things worse, a rogue planet is on a crash course with the disabled dwarf. in order to restart the engine, hundreds of mile-high pistons must be test fired. things are going well, until rimmer accidentally crushes most of the skutters when he test fires the wrong pistons. rimmer turns holly on to warn him that red dwarf is doomed. holly prints out a solution and shuts himself down again. starbug is to fire a nuclear missile into a nearby sun, causing a solar flare that will knock its planet out of orbit and in turn, knock the rogue planet away from the dwarf. rimmer and lister carry out the plan and although successful, starbug crashes into the icy rogue planet. rimmer and lister are marooned on the planet, lister begins to starve and rimmer begins to slow down. he shuts down and is brought online back on red dwarf, where he intends to launch a rescue operation. however, the dwarf is being sucked into a black hole. holly, via the toaster- having shared the information with the toaster earlier-, informs them that if they accelerate into the hole, they can zip through safely. lister, meanwhile, is having problems of his own. the ice on the planet has melted, revealing a landscape of green glass bottles. acid rain begins destroying starbug. when he sees the remains of mount rushmore, he finds that he is on earth, converted into a garbage dump for the solar system and accidentally blasted from orbit. lister discovers a tiny olive tree and befriends some cow-sized cockroaches and vows to begin life again. after the black hole experience, the dwarfers finally go to rescue lister; rimmer and the cat in one ship, kryten and the toaster in the other. rimmer and the cat are shocked to find a beautiful farm amidst the garbage, tended by an old lister. because of the time dilation of the black hole, thirty years have passed on the planet. kryten contacts the rest of the crew having found a polymorph disguised as lister, which the toaster disables. lister insists the polymorph's remains be shot out into space, but its offspring manages to return to red dwarf. it steals emotions from the crew until they are saved by a freak accident which slays the beast, causing them to regain their emotions. the stress of the battle is too much for the elderly lister, and he dies from a heart attack. after lister's funeral, rimmer informs holly of the loss. holly prints out some instructions to rescue a canister from certain coordinates in space. they are then to fly back into the black hole and enter a parallel dimension, where they are to bury lister and the canister (which contains kochanski's ashes). lister wakes up in a strange hospital in a weird world where time runs backwards. he recovers from his heart attack, regurgitates lunch, and is forced to take a wallet and watch from a mugger. a message from the dwarf crew instructs lister to meet them in thirty years (they can't stay with him or they would have gotten younger). lister takes a taxi to his new home, and finds an elderly kochanski waiting for him. lister is happy, knowing that he and kochanski have many years behind them to look forward to. when the two red dwarf novels were printed together as an omnibus, rob grant and doug naylor took the opportunity to alter the ending of better than life in order to clear up confusion about the book's ending. ||| 5 ||| 2
sittaford is a tiny village on the fringe of dartmoor. mrs willett and her daughter violet are the newly installed tenants of sittaford house, a residence owned by a trevelyan, a retired army captain. they invite four people to tea on friday afternoon: captain trevelyan's long-standing friend, major burnaby, mr rycroft, mr ronnie garfield and mr duke. at the suggestion of mr garfield, the six of them decide to play a game of table-turning. during this séance, at 5.25 pm, a spirit announces that captain trevelyan has just been murdered. concerned for the captain's safety, major burnaby says that he intends to walk to exhampton, a village six miles away, to see if captain trevelyan is alright. after four days of snow, there is already a thick layer of snow on the ground and further heavy snowfall has been forecast for later that evening. there is no telephone in sittaford, and it is impossible to use a car because of the snow. two and a half hours later, just before 8 pm, in the middle of a blizzard, major burnaby is trudging up the path to the front door of hazelmoor, the house in exhampton where captain trevelyan now lives. when nobody answers the door, he fetches the local police and a doctor. they enter the house through the open study window at the back, and find captain trevelyan's dead body on the floor. dr warren estimates the time of death at between 5 and 6pm. a fracture of the base of the skull is the cause of death. the weapon was a green baize tube full of sand, used as a draught excluder at the bottom of the door. captain trevelyan's will states that, apart from £100 for his servant evans, his property has to be equally divided among four people: his sister jennifer gardner, his nephew james pearson, his niece sylvia dering and his nephew brian pearson. each of these four would inherit approximately £20.000. james pearson is arrested for murder because he was in exhampton at the time of the murder, trying unsuccessfully to get a loan from captain trevelyan. while the official investigation is led by inspector narracott, james pearson's fiancee emily trefusis starts sleuthing herself. she's assisted by charles enderby, a daily wire journalist who, the day after the murder, presented a cheque for £5000 to major burnaby for winning the newspaper's football competition. emily and charles go to stay with mr and mrs curtis in sittaford, searching for clues. mr dacres, james pearson's solicitor, reveals to emily that things look much worse than they already imagined. james has "borrowed" money from his firm to buy shares without the knowledge of the firm. there are several red herrings. brian pearson, who came under suspicion when enderby discovered him making a late-night rendezvous with violet willett, is violet's fiancé. he was not in australia, as first thought, but in england all the time. and the willetts' motive - up to now obscure and a cause of suspicion - for moving into the isolated sittaford house had nothing to do with any connection with captain trevelyan, but was in order to live close to dartmoor prison. an escaped convict (though later recaptured), whose escape from dartmoor prison three days after the murder was engineered by brian pearson, is violet's father. the plan was that, after the escape, her father and brian would live with them in the house as manservants until the danger was past. martin dering created a false alibi because his wife sylvia was watching him for divorce proceedings. sylvia is mr rycroft's niece; jennifer gardner is mr garfield's godmother; and mr duke is an ex-chief-inspector of scotland yard. emily solves the mystery in hazelmoor after finding captain trevelyan's ski boots hidden in the chimney and two pairs of skis in different sizes. major burnaby is the killer. he cleverly and opportunistically engineered the table movements during the séance to make the spirit convey the message that captain trevelyan had been murdered. instead of walking the six miles in two and a half hours after the séance, he first went to his own house which was close by, put on skis, and skied the distance in a fraction of that time. he killed captain trevelyan about a quarter to six. then he cleaned his skis, and put them in the cupboard. he hid trevelyan's ski boots in the chimney and put his own in the cupboard with the other ski gear, hoping that the second pair of skis and the fact that they wouldn't fit trevelyan would pass unnoticed. mr rycroft, who is a member of the psychical research society, reassembles five of the six original participants for a second séance at sittaford house, the absent mr duke being replaced by brian pearson. the séance has scarcely begun, when inspector narracott steps in, in the company of emily and mr duke, and charges major burnaby with the murder of captain trevelyan. emily explains that burnaby had lost a lot of money by buying rotten shares and that his motive for the murder was to keep for himself the cheque for £5000. although he denied it to enderby and the police, he had already received the letter notifying him of the win on the morning of the day on which he murdered trevelyan and which was actually won by captain trevelyan himself. trevelyan would often use burnaby’s name to send in competition solutions because he found sittaford house too grand an address for such correspondence. in the final chapter emily turns down a marriage proposal by enderby who has fallen in love with her during the investigation, because she still loves her fiancé james despite his character faults. ||| 6 ||| 6
the story takes place in northern europe, in an area inhabited by clans of humans named after different animals. these clans live a hunter-gatherer existence and adhere to a shamanic belief system. six months after the events of wolf brother, torak, the young male protagonist, is now living with the raven clan. one of the clan members, becomes sick and attempts to kill himself and his young nephew, but is stopped by the clan's leader. he is tied up and quarantined. torak suspects that the sickness has been created by a group of renegade shamans known as the soul-eaters. leaders from other clans come to the raven camp and tell them the sickness has been spreading through the forest. torak realises that a small creature has been stalking him and trying to kill him, and when oslak escapes and kills himself, torak discovers that the creature was responsible. torak sneaks out of the camp and goes into the forest seeking a cure. wolf, torak's companion from the previous novel, has been living with a pack in the high mountains, but becomes unhappy with his life and he goes off to find torak. renn, the female protagonist, has encountered the creature at the raven camp and the clan's shaman, sauenn, explains that a it is a tokoroth: a child who has been stolen from their mother and abused by the soul-eaters until he or she does their bidding, the soul-eaters then put a demon inside the child. renn sneaks out of the camp to find torak and she and wolf encounter each other. they then both go looking for him. at the seashore, torak encounters and fights three boys from the seal clan: bale, detlan and asrif, but is eventually overpowered. they believe that, by washing his hunting gear in the sea, he has dishonoured the sea mother and must be punished, so they take him by canoe to their home in the seal islands. renn and wolf meet up with some members of the sea eagle clan, who take them both to the seal islands to help torak. the seal clan's shaman, tenris, initially wants to punish torak until torak informs him of the sickness. tenris tells torak that a cure can be made from a rare plant which grows at the top of a particular cliff: the plant must be gathered on midsummer night, which is only four days away. torak quickly realises the tokoroth has followed him to the island. he goes looking for it but is tricked into falling into a seal net, from which he is rescued by wolf and renn. they talk and establish that an orca has been killed, breaking a taboo. only the teeth have been removed from the carcass. renn informs torak that she saw one of the seal clan near the orca's carcass, but she is unable to persuade torak that any of the clan would break such a taboo. torak goes with bale, detlan and asrif to climb the cliff and gather the plant. asrif climbs up but his climbing harness becomes snagged, and torak follows him up. he has to unhook himself from his rope to rescue deltan and to gather the plant. unable to reach his harness, he realises that the only way back down is to dive into the sea. under the water, he feels himself taking the form of a fish for a few moments and senses an angry orca approaching, before returning to his body. the boys rush into the water to save torak as an orca attacks detlan, causing him a crippling injury. when they return to the island, torak talks with tenris about the odd experience he had in the water. tenris explains that torak must be a spirit walker: a human with the rare ability to drift out of his own body and into the body of any other living creature. renn is found by some of the seal clan and realises that tenris was responsible for killing the orca, and that he must be a soul-eater. tenris notices a scab on her hand and, mistaking it for a symptom of the sickness, tells bale to lock her up so the sickness won't spread. on midsummers night, torak goes to the crag to make the cure with tenris, but tenris overpowers torak with the help of two tokoroth. tenris admits that he is a soul-eater, and that he killed the orca. he reveals that he had created the rogue bear which killed torak's father and, realizing that the bear's killer must be a powerful shaman, had sent the tokoroth to poison the juniper berries of the forest, knowing that the epidemic will flush him out as he searches for a cure. tenris intends to eat torak's heart, in order to assimilate his powers and become the greatest soul-eater. tenris also reveals that torak's father was his own brother, and had been a soul-eater before seeing the error of his ways. wolf appears and chases away the tokoroth. renn, who has persuades bale to let her go, shoots tenris through the hand with an arrow, giving torak the opportunity to escape by diving off the crag. tenris jumps after him, but the blood

the third novel in the uglies series begins two months after events in pretties, when tally youngblood has become a member of an elite group of "specials" - surgically enhanced super-humans - called the cutters. the cutters were originally founded by shay, who invented the use of ritual self-harm to become "bubbly" and clear-headed in spite of brain lesions used to make her pretty-minded. all of the specials in this group were able to get rid of the brain lesions on their own, and now live in the wild. they were adopted into special circumstances and given enhanced senses, strength and reflexes, and are among the youngest agents working for dr cable. the cutters disguise themselves as uglies in order to crash a party in uglyville and search for members of the new smoke. tally successfully finds a girl giving out pills which cure the pretty lesions, which she encourages the uglies to take to the crims - tally and shay's old clique. the cutters attempt to capture the girl, but she escapes on a hoverboard with david's help. giving chase, the cutters are ambushed by smokies with unusually advanced technology, including infra-red masking sneak suits and electrical weapons. the smokies kidnap fausto, one of the cutters, and leave shay and tally injured. hearing that the pills are intended for zane, tally insists on going to see her boyfriend, who suffered brain damage in new pretty town and has been hospitalized since tally turned special. tally discovers that while zane is free of the pretty lesions, his brain has been damaged and his physical infirmity now disgusts her. she begins to wonder if she received a brain operation when being made special which has given her feelings of superiority. eager to show dr. cable that zane is cured so that he will be made special, shay and tally break into the city armory to steal something to cut off zane's tracking necklace. they succeed, but in the attempt, they accidentally destroy much of the armory, putting the city on high alert. then, they begin to secretly track zane and the crims as they journey to the new smoke, although the pair split up when tally receives a guide to the new smoke from her friend andrew simpson smith, an escapee from a reservation of primitive culture. shay follows the guide straight to the smoke, but tally insists on staying with zane. on the journey, zane notices tally and confronts her about her reasons for following him. the pair kiss, but tally is still repulsed by zane's tremors and runs away from him. tally continues to follow the group to the new smoke - a city called diego, which accepts runaways freely, having widely adopted the pretty cure and rejected the rules about surgery, allowing anyone to look how they please rather than following the international standard. tally is amazed by this, but horrified to hear that diego is beginning to expand into the wild, clear-cutting forest like the rusties did. tally finds fausto at a party for newly arrived runaways, but realizes his special brain surgery has been cured. he had given informed consent before he became special to take a "cure" for having a special brain. tally only just escapes being forcibly injected. her escape attempt leaves her helpless, as she jumps off a cliff with only crash bracelets to catch her fall. she is picked up by diego's authorities and locked up for her lethal strength and weapon-sharp teeth and fingernails, which they insist on removing. the doctors inform her that she has received brain surgery to give her flashes of anger and euphoria, along with feelings of superiority, although they will not change this without her consent. with shay's help, tally escapes just before the surgery begins. shay and the other cutters have all been cured by fausto, but they want tally's help to protect diego from imminent attack by dr cable, who is blaming the so-called new system for the attack on the armory. tally assists in the evacuation of the hospital, but learns after the attack that zane, having just received surgery to cure his tremors, died of complications during the confusion of the attack. grief-stricken, tally leaves immediately to tell dr cable the truth about the attack on the armory. just before she reaches the city, she meets david, who took a helicopter to talk to her in time. he tells her that he still believes she can think her own way out of her brain surgery, but gives her an injector full of the cure so that she has the option of curing herself. arriving at special circumstances headquarters, tally finds dr cable and the specials have taken control of the city. dr cable knows that tally was responsible for the attack, but has chosen to use the attack as a way to seize control over both this city and diego. tally tricks dr cable into stabbing herself on the injector, and is imprisoned underground for a month, watching the feeds as dr. cable slowly loses her grip on the city and the cure begins to spread. diego publishes scans of tally's special body, calling her a "morphilogical violation," and the world is outraged by dr cable's "secret" experiments on unconsenting teenagers. eventually, tally is taken as the last remaining special to be "despecialized", but she resists the surgeons and breaks out with dr. cable's help, becoming the only true special left. she returns to david, still waiting at the rusty ruins, and realizes that her other friends have all found their places in the new system. she decides that she wishes to remain in the wild, free from surgery, and with david she will form the "new special circumstances", ensuring that nature is protected from mankind's excesses. ||| 7 ||| 2
after angus thermopyle was framed and arrested for stealing station supplies from com-mine, morn hyland escaped with captain nick succorso aboard his ship, the captain's fancy. as part of a deal morn made with angus, she will not reveal to anyone that she has a zone implant - a device angus installed in her brain allowing him to control her while he raped and abused her - meaning that angus will not face death for unauthorized use of a zone implant, and in turn angus gave morn the zone implant control. with the control in her hands she soon becomes addicted to the effects of a zone implant. nick misinterpreted morn's intentions and expects her to 'repay' him by being his new lover. the abuse morn suffered under angus has left her unable to stand the touch of another man, but she soon works out how to use the zone implant to induce artificial sexual desire to fulfil nick's desires. while on board the captain's fancy, the data first orn vorbuld repeatedly molests morn whenever they end up alone together, eventually leading to a showdown with nick after orn attempts to rape her. orn reveals that he has planted a virus in the ship's computer that, if not deactivated by him, will wipe the computer's memory and leave the ship stranded in space. in spite of this, nick still kills him and the ship soon falls under the effects of the virus. meanwhile, morn discovers that she has become pregnant, and the age of the fetus indicates that angus thermopyle is the father. reflecting on the death of her family, she decides to keep it, which nick allows her on the condition that she is able to stop the virus. she does so, and nick keeps his end of the bargain, but not in a way morn expected: nick sets course for enablement station, an outpost in forbidden space, a region of space controlled by the mysterious amnion. the amnion are a race of creatures whose society is centered around their ability to manipulate dna. they intend on dominating the human species through use of mutagens that would turn humans into amnion themselves, but for now are held at bay in their section of the universe - what humans call forbidden space. no one but pirates and other illegals ever deal with the amnion for fear that they themselves will be turned into amnion, but nick maintains that they would never go back on their word for fear that if they did no humans would deal with them. once they arrive at the station nick convinces the amnion to give them enough credit to fix their gap drive (which was damaged previously) and to force grow morn's unborn child to adulthood, in exchange for a phial of nick's blood, which the amnion mistakenly believe holds the key to genetic immunity to their mutagens (the "immunity" is actually caused by a drug, of which the amnion are unaware). the amnion keep their promises and give nick the credit he asked for and force grow morn's baby to the approximate age of 16. her mind is copied onto her son, a process which she survives only due to the effects of her zone implant. nick becomes enraged when he sees morn's child, named davies hyland after her father; davies is the spitting image of his real father, angus thermopyle. after getting back to the ship the amnion inadvertently reveal the existence of morn's zone implant when they explain that it protected her from the brain damage a mind imprint would cause. nick realizes that morn's love for him was all a masque and when the amnion request that they return davies hyland to them for experimentation, nick complies in return for parts to fix his gap drive. morn soon manages to hold the ship and enablement station hostage by putting the ship's self-destruct on a pressure release trigger so she can get her child back, as well as the parts needed to fix the ship. they enable their gap drive but it begins to fail. vector shaheed, the ship's engineer, manages to avert a disaster and they survive, coming 'back into tard' with a slagged gap drive far from enablement, but still in amnion space. to everyone's surprise the ship is travelling at an unprecedented .9c, or nine tenths the speed of light. in the ensuing chaos, nick is able to retake command of the ship. setting course for thanatos minor where an illegal trade outpost called billingate resides, two amnion warships catch up and nick negotiates to have davies transferred to one in an ejection pod. after being released from her cabin by some of the crew who no longer trust nick, morn manages to get the pod reprogrammed so that it misses the amnion ship and heads toward billingate. in the meantime, the incarcerated angus thermopyle is tortured and interrogated on com-mine by milos taverner, the head of com-mine security. eventually he is requisitioned by the umcp and transformed into a cyborg, (a process known as "welding) under the complete control of the computers connected to his brain. the umcp then prepares to send milos and angus together on a highly classified mission against thanatos minor. ||| 5 ||| 5

the story is told in first-person perspective by the geologist william dyer, a professor at miskatonic university. he writes to disclose hitherto unknown and closely kept secrets in the hope that he can deter a planned and much publicized scientific expedition to antarctica. on a previous expedition there, scholars from miskatonic university led by dyer discovered fantastic and horrific ruins and a dangerous secret beyond a range of mountains higher than the himalayas. a smaller advance group led by professor lake discovered and crossed the mountains and found the remains of 14 ancient life forms, completely unknown to science and unidentifiable as either plants or animals. six of the specimens are badly damaged and the others uncannily pristine. their highly evolved features are problematic: their stratum location puts them at a point on the geologic time scale much too early for such features to have naturally evolved yet. when the main expedition loses contact with lake's party, dyer and the rest of his colleagues travel to their last known location to investigate. lake's camp is devastated, and both the men and the dogs slaughtered, while a man named gedney and another dog are unaccounted for. near the camp they find six star-shaped snow mounds, and one specimen buried under each. they discover that the better preserved life forms have vanished, and that some form of dissection experiment has been done on an unnamed man and a dog. dyer elects to close off the area from which they took their samples. dyer and a graduate student named danforth fly an airplane over the mountains, which they soon realize are the outer wall of a huge, abandoned stone city of cubes and cones, utterly alien compared with any human architecture. because of their resemblance to creatures of myth mentioned in the necronomicon, the builders of this lost civilization are dubbed the "elder things". by exploring these fantastic structures, the men are able to learn the history of the elder things by interpreting their magnificent hieroglyphic murals: the elder things first came to earth shortly after the moon was pulled loose from the planet and were the creators of life. they built their cities with the help of "shoggoths", biological entities created to perform any task, assume any form, and reflect any thought. as more buildings are explored, a fantastic vista opens of the history of races beyond the scope of man's understanding, including the elder things' conflicts with the star-spawn of cthulhu and the mi-go who arrived on earth some time after the elder things themselves. the images also reflect a degradation in the order of this civilization, as the shoggoths gain independence. as more resources are applied to maintaining order, the etchings become haphazard and primitive. the murals also allude to some unnamed evil in an even larger mountain range just past their city which even they fear greatly. eventually, as antarctica became uninhabitable even for the elder things, they migrated into a large, subterranean ocean. dyer and danforth eventually realize they are not alone in the city. the elder things missing from the advance party's camp had somehow returned to life and, after slaughtering the explorers, returned to the city of their origin. dyer and danforth discover traces of the elder things' earlier exploration, as well as sledges containing the corpses of gedney and the dog missing from the camp. as the two progress further into the city, they are ultimately drawn to a massive, ominous entrance which is the opening of a tunnel which they believe leads into the subterranean region described in the murals. compulsively they are drawn in, finding further horrors: evidence of dead elder things killed in a brutal struggle, and blind six-foot-tall penguins wandering around placidly, apparently as livestock for the unknown forms of life which lurked inside the subterranean abyss. they are then confronted with an immense, ululating horror in the form of a black, bubbling mass, which after a brief glimpse they identify as a shoggoth. danforth and dyer escape with their lives using luck and diversion. on the plane high above the plateau, danforth looks back and sees something that causes him to lose his sanity. he refuses to tell anyone (even dyer) what he saw, though it is implied that it has something to do with what lies beyond the larger mountain range that even the elder things feared. professor dyer concludes that the elder things and their civilization were eventually destroyed by the shoggoths they created and that this entity has sustained itself on the enormous penguins since eons past. he begs the planners of the next proposed antarctic expedition to stay away from things that should not be loosed on this earth. ||| 3 ||| 5
several attempts are made on giraut's life as he works on his new ix cycle of music. he is sent back to wilson, his home planet and culture of occitan, to complete the new music along with his office of special projects team as protection. paxa retires from the osp and leaves giraut after finding out she cannot be successfully backed up on a psypyx, which would make her death permanent. giraut begins to fall in love with a fellow musician azalais who introduces him to ebles, a contact for rogue colonies outside of council space which call themselves the union. soon after, azalais is killed and giraut is severely injured in another assassination attempt. after giraut is healed he is contacted again by union. margaret sends him, along with raimbaut and laprada, to the rogue union colony of noucatharia to get to the bottom of several coincidences, including the whereabouts of a possible psypyx of shan, and to find out who keeps trying to kill him. once there giraut begins to fall in love with rielis, a talented musician and singer, as he tries to uncover what union wants from him and the council. it is revealed to giraut and his team that everyone on noucatharia is either an aintellect in human form or a chimera human/aintellect, both of which are forbidden horrors in council space. they are also told there are multiple aintellect conspiracies unknown to the osp, and that noucatharia was the site of the first invasion by an unknown alien army, in which humans were beheaded and aintellects/robots fought as best they could. after another amateurish assassination attempt he is kidnapped, separated from his team, and implanted with shan's psypyx. as rielis questions shan, giraut and rielis rapidly come to know what happened on addams to cause it to lose contact with earth. an aggressive alien aintellect-run invasion overwhelmed their defenses and killed everyone not in hiding—their goal being to destructively holograph brains, deconstruct aintellects and send back those memories and experiences to their home planet to be consumed as entertainment for their dependent organic creators who had isolated themselves in virtual reality. only by advanced planning by shan's father and help from his personal aintellect was a very young shan able to escape via springer to earth. the osp invades noucatharia with help from raimbaut just as giraut/shan and rielis are beginning to agree on the cooperation that is needed between the council and the union to face the alien threat. giraut/shan are held prisoner by margaret until the osp can sort out friend from foe, but paxa comes through a springer to free giraut. he quickly recognizes that paxa is joined to azalais as a chimera in exchange for being able to be psypyxed in the future, and to help the progressive and dynamic union face an alien threat. giraut/shan and paxa/azalais mount a rescue mission and free the aintellect humans and chimeras from osp control and get raimbaut to join them. raimbaut and giraut/shan then choose to stay behind in an attempt to rescue or destroy a rielis psypyx from an osp building before it can be tortured for its knowledge and secrets. they destroy the psypyx and margaret captures them before they can make it to a springer. raimbaut is quickly cleared of charges and shan is eventually implanted in margaret's brain—but giraut is found guilty of assisting the aintellect conspiracies in escaping from noucatharia. his trial is a rallying cry for human supremacists, but over time and as the facts come out they are increasingly marginalized by society who see giraut as a martyr. the only thing left is for him to be executed to permit his public beheading to serve as a unifying story for future generations, as contact is made with the aintellect-run union colonies. ||| 5 ||| 5

mohan rayat and lindsay neville have been sent to the bottom of the ocean, after having been infected with c'naatat in the world before, to spend forever living with the bezeri to help them rebuild and recover. but first they must undergo cellular reconstruction in order to survive in the depths, which happens at an astounding rate. ade bennett and aras have the unpleasant duty to tell shan frankland, their isan, what they did. since shan threw herself into deep space to keep c'naatat from rayat and earth's government, she was not pleased that the symbiont was just given to them. she tells esganikan of the eqbas vorhi about the development and she agrees to take precautions against it being spread. neville and rayat are changed people, literally. they have developed gills and can sense their surroundings using sonar. the bezeri have put them to work extracting maps from a contaminated zone that the bezeri cannot enter. rayat wants to acquire the bioluminescence ability that shan has so he can try to communicate with the bezeri without the aid of the translation lamp. shan had acquired bioluminescence in a previous encounter and passed that on to ade. he in turn would have passed that on to rayat and neville when he infected them but this has not manifested itself. in an effort to make it manifest, rayat asks for cells from the bezeri. the matriarch of the group brings the body of a youth that has recently died and rayat and lindsay put some of its tissue and blood into their own bloodstream. ade, shan and eddie have gone with the eqbas to visit umeh. while there, shan and ade finally consummate their relationship. the eqbas are attacked by the maritime fringe, a neighboring state of jejeno, but the attack causes no damage to the eqbas and the eqbas retaliate swiftly by destroying most of the far city of buyg. they all take a trip in the eqbas ship to visit that city and determine if they are now willing to cooperate. the maritime fringe responds with ineffective violence which is met with return fire from the eqbas. ade has noticed that his bioluminescence and shan's seem to respond to each other and to other lights. he thinks the possibility exists that c'naatat is sentient and is communicating. others don't want to think of that as possible so they are avoiding the issue. shan calls aras to let him know they are coming back to wess'ej and discover that vijissi, who was thrown into space with shan because he refused to abandon her, has been found and is alive—infected with c'naatat. pt:matriarch ||| 5 ||| 5
the novel is divided into four books. each book follows a different style of writing. notably, the third is in the form of a statement taken from a witness and the fourth (mostly) takes the form of court proceedings. the first book details the lives of the characters lionel lawson, harry josephs, barbara josephs, paul morris, ruth rawlinson and peter morris. it doesn't directly mention philip lawson but there are several indirect references to him as the tramp. this book sets up the various motives for the plot. it also highlights the jealousy and hatred some of the characters feel towards each other for various reasons. morse is on furlough and by chance happens to visit st. frideswide. there he comes to know about the murder of harry josephs and the subsequent suicide of lionel lawson. he finds out that harry josephs was first poisoned with morphine before being stabbed in the back. this curious fact sparks his attention and he begins to take an active interest in the case. when inspector bell who was previously charge of the case goes down with the flu, morse & lewis take official charge of the investigation. true to his usual self, morse comes up with several theories each of which is shown to be wrong with gathering evidence. subsequently morse locates the dead bodies of paul morris and peter morris by instincts. when barbara josephs is also murdered, morse finally sees the light in the case. he figures out that ruth would be the next victim and the church (again) would be the scene of the crime. he then places lewis in an opposite building to watch the church, and he hides in the church. morse confronts the murderer, revealed to be harry josephs, atop the church tower. the two men struggle, and harry falls from the tower to his death. this book is about the statement given by ruth to lewis. she explains how she was hard up for money and agreed to help lionel lawson in a plot to murder harry josephs. she tries to put it across that she was never directly involved except as a witness to identify the dead man. on reading the statement, morse rejects is as complete perjury and tears it up. this book mostly takes the form of court proceedings as morse reveals how the murderer harry josephs committed the crimes. he guesses that the first victim was philip lawson and ruth's role was mainly to misidentify the body as that of harry josephs. he subsequently explains how harry murdered the morris father and son and then his wife barbara. as for the question of lionel lawson, morse suggests it was suicide. ruth is sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for perjury. in the first closing scene, it is implied that lionel lawson was in fact murdered. in the last scene, morse visits ruth at her flat after her release and they start off a romantic relationship. ||| 1 ||| 6

the archaeologist hero, kenton, receives a mysterious ancient babylonian artifact, which he discovers contains an incredibly detailed model of a ship. a dizzy spell casts kenton onto the deck of the ship, which becomes a full-sized vessel sailing an eternal sea. at one end is sharane the assistant priestess of ishtar and her female minions, and at the other is klaneth the assistant priest of nergal and his male minions, representatives of two opposed deities. none of them can cross an invisible barrier at the midline of the ship, but kenton can. his arrival destabilizes a situation that had been frozen for 6,000 years, and fantastic adventures ensue. the novel is not only a rousing fantasy adventure story, but a philosophical exploration of the relationship between material reality and the abstract concepts through which humans struggle to understand it. the reason the ship has been frozen in time is that zarpanit the head priestess of ishtar and alusar the head priest of nergal fell in love, and were in the midst of making love when their deities possessed them. this placed the hostile deities in an untenable position, especially as they represented cosmic forces that must be kept separate. the result was an imbalance between stability and instability in the universe, freezing the ship in time and rendering unstable its connection to the reality inhabited by the reader. in a study of fantasy and science fiction literature, william sims bainbridge (1986: 136) explained: "the author uses evocative language and intense images to convey a sense of the marvelous and mysterious. it is kenton's fate to intervene in the frozen cosmic struggle between ishtar and nergal, to fall in love with sharane, and to gain klaneth as his mortal enemy. the book builds tension through the device of letting kenton's tie to the ship periodically become so weak that he falls back, unwilling, to his new york home. kenton's tenuous psychic connection to the ship represents the reader's involvement in the fantasy. at any moment the ship may fade from reality, and both kenton and the reader will be imprisoned in the mundane world of the everyday." ||| 2 ||| 5

the plot of permutation city follows the lives of several people in a near future reality where the earth is ravaged by the effects of climate change, the economy and culture are largely globalised (the most commonly used denomination of currency is the ecu, the precursor to the euro in use at the time the book was written), and civilisation has accumulated vast amounts of cloud computing power and memory which is distributed internationally and is traded in a public market called the qips exchange (qips from mips, where the q is quadrillions). most importantly, from the perspective of the story, this great computing capacity is used to construct physiological models of patients for medical purposes, reducing the need for actual medical experimentation and enabling personalised medical treatments, but also enabling the creation of copies, whole brain emulations of "scanned" humans which are detailed enough to allow for subjective conscious experience on the part of the emulation. although not yet in widespread usage, scanning has become safe enough and common enough to allow for a few wealthy or dedicated humans to afford to create backups of themselves, generally with the intention of surviving the biological deaths of their bodies. a minority of copies exist, though they are largely perceived (with some justification) as being a collection of the thanatophobic eccentric rich. copies do not yet possess human rights under the laws of any nation or international body, although some of the wealthiest copies, those still involved with their own estates or businesses, finance a powerful lobby and public relations effort to advance the copy rights cause. to this effect, the legal status of copies is viewed as somewhat farcical even by sceptics of the cause, and many expect full copy rights to be granted in europe within two decades. the plotline travels back and forth between the years of 2045 and 2050, and deals with events surrounding the life of a sydney man named paul durham, who is obsessed, yet frustrated, with experimenting on copies of himself (because he believes copies of himself should be more willing to undergo experimentation). in the latter time frame, durham is suspected to be a con artist of some type, who travels around the world visiting rich copies and offering them prime real estate in some sort of advanced supercomputer which, according to his pitch, will never be shut down and will be powerful enough to support any number of copies in vr environments of their own designing at no slowdown whatsoever, no matter how preposterously opulent those environments might be. he pitches this concept to the copies, predicated upon the prediction that the copy rights movement might run into resistance due to devastating climate change. as the world undergoes increasingly extreme and erratic weather, a variety of international bodies, especially the association of southeast asian nations, which has been particularly hard-hit by tropical storms, have proposed projects to use their vast computing resources to attempt to intervene, utilising chaotic effects to their advantage, in global weather patterns with such precision as to minimise weather-related destruction while also minimising the scale of the efforts necessary to do so. durham predicts this will clash with the spread of copy rights, as both copies and weather simulations will demand increasing qips exchange shares in the future. all that each copy must do is to make the laughably small investment of two million ecus in order to bring durham's fantasy computer into existence. as part of his plot, durham hires maria deluca, an autoverse enthusiast. she has recently become famous within the small community of autoverse hobbyists for developing a variety of a. lamberti which evolved the capacity to metabolise an autoverse toxin. durham contacts her and offers to pay her thirty thousand dollars to design an autoverse program which, given a large enough computer, could potentially evolve into a planet bearing maria's own strain of evolvable autoverse life. she desperately wants the money to have her dying mother scanned into a copy. since no such computer to fully evolve autoverse life exists, durham has to try to convince maria that he is a wealthy autoverse enthusiast interested in her evolvability results and looking for a proof of concept for a much larger system. he also clandestinely commissions a famous virtual reality architect, malcolm carter, to build a full scale, high resolution vr city, permutation city, the largest vr environment ever conceived, complete with reactive crowds and a staggering variety of full scale, high resolution scenic views. as computer fraud investigators begin to close in on durham's scheme, maria is pressured by police into covertly gathering evidence in order to incriminate durham, while continuing to work for him. she learns more about durham himself, including his time spent in psychiatric care and his callous experimentation on his own copies, as well as his assiduously reticent copy backers. meanwhile, two slum-dwelling solipsist nation copies, peer and kate, explore their post-human existences as well as their strained but loving relationship, until kate's long-time friend malcolm carter offers to secretly hack them both, along with any moderately-sized software packages they wish, into permutation city's machine code, guaranteeing them a place in the city were it ever to run, but permanently debarring them from manipulating the city's implementation for fear of being deleted as extraneous cruft by automated software. at the end of part one, durham reveals the full extent of his plan to maria: after taking his earlier self-experiments to their logical conclusion, he became convinced of something he came to call the dust theory, which holds that there is no difference, even in principle, between physics and mathematics, and that all mathematically possible structures exist, among them our physics and therefore our spacetime. these structures are being computed, in the manner of a program on a universal turing machine, using something durham refers to as "dust" which is a generic, vague term describing anything which can be interpreted to represent information; and therefore, that the only thing that matters is that a mathematical structure be self-consistent and, as such, computable. as long as a mathematical structure is possibly computable, then it is being computed on some dust, though it does not matter what dust actually is, only that there be a possible interpretation where such a computation is taking place somehow. the dust theory implies, as such, that all possible universes exist and are equally real, emerging spontaneously from their own mathematical self-consistency. due to the computability of consciousness and the function of consciousness as a matrix for interpretation, copies hold the unique position of being the only conscious beings which themselves are not being computed by self-consistent mathematical rules (existing, of course, in virtual realities held together by heuristics merely for the sake of their experience). as such, in principle it should be the case that when a copy is terminated and deleted, its own conscious experience will continue due to the fact that there is no precedent within the copy's interpretive matrix by which the copy should suddenly cease. indeed, durham himself claims to have been through such a process several times, each time finding himself back in "the real world" after deletion, with there existing some plausible explanation as to why he believed himself to have been a copy who was deleted, though with each successive experience of copying himself and being deleted, he gradually became increasingly confident that the experiences were actually the result of his consciousness finding a logical interpretation in which it had not actually ceased, rather than each successive experience being ultimately true and real. because of this, durham is staging a massive, momentary buyout of the world's processing power to simulate a minute or two of a "garden of eden" configuration of an infinitely-expanding, massively complex cellular automaton universe (similar to what is known as a "spacefiller" configuration in conway's game of life) based on a fictional, turing-complete cellular automaton known as tvc ("turing/von neumann/chiang", named after its conceiver and designer), in which each iteration of the expansion serves to "manufacture" an extra layer of blocks of a computing configuration. ultimately, if a copy were to be run in such a self-consistent universe, and were to observe, via a series of pre-defined experiments, the cellular nature of its own processing implementation, then there would be precedent for that self-consistent "tvc universe" to persist in its own terms even after its termination and deletion in the universe it was designed and launched in. his and his investors' copies would therefore persist indefinitely in the simulation, and since the "space" of the tvc universe would be made of self-reproducing cellular automaton computer processors, the simulation would not possess a finite number of states and the passengers would not, in principle, run out of interesting things to get up to. implanting himself and his investors in this tvc universe, durham believed he could prove or falsify his hypothesis that his experience of repeated termination and continuation was the result of his own interpreting himself into universes in which he might plausibly have believed he had had such an experience, as opposed to merely having inhabited such a universe all along. if he were to implant his copy into the tvc universe, have the copy run a number of experiments to anchor itself in that universe, and then terminate it, only to find himself still in the tvc universe (indeed, the purpose of growing the tvc universe from a garden of eden configuration was to prove to his copy that such a tvc universe as it found itself to inhabit must have been launched from a non-tvc universe, as opposed to merely having always existed and evolved towards this the current state in which he did not know whether it had) rather than back in "the real world" again, then he would be vindicated; if not, then his hypothesis would be falsified and he might consider himself crazy (his last several experiences of termination and subsequent continuation involved him finding himself in the position of having been recently cured of psychosis). the autoverse planetary seed program designed by maria was to be included in the tvc universe package for his investors to explore once life had evolved there after it had been run on a significantly large segment of the tvc universe. though maria believes durham to be obviously rationalising his experiences while psychotic, she agrees to durham's request to have herself scanned and inserted into the tvc launch as an on-hand autoverse expert. the six-hundred thousand dollar fee will allow her mother to be scanned, and she is certain that her copy will never wake because she demands to be present at the launch to verify that her copy is not run during the launch period, and is subsequently deleted. after a successful launch, simulation, termination, and deletion of the tvc universe, durham and maria have uncomfortable sex in awkward celebration, and later that night, while maria is asleep, durham disembowels himself with a kitchen knife in his bathtub, believing his role as the springboard for his deleted tvc copy to discover its true identity to be fulfilled. maria wakes in permutation city seven thousand years of subjective time after the launch, furious at durham for being awoken and refusing to believe that the launch was successful. durham eventually persuades her, however, by showing her the complexity of the autoverse planet she had designed, planet lambert, which had then been running on a suitably large chunk of the tvc universe for several billion subjective years. intelligent life in the form of complex swarms of insect-like eusocial beings had evolved on lambert from maria's original autobacterium hydrophilus, and the citizens of permutation city were on the verge of making contact with the creatures. however, a town hall vote restricted the autoverse scholars from making contact until the creatures had independently hypothesized the existence of a creator. meanwhile, permutation city had flourished in the tvc universe, and the original inhabitants of a few hundred had exploded to a population of tens of thousands, with the descendants of the various founders sharing their founders' ever growing chunks of the tvc universe, with permutation city acting as the central locus for interaction between populations located in different contiguous blocks of the universe. durham, however, confides in maria that he does not believe the insectoid creatures will ever seriously consider the concept of a creator and intends to use maria's slice of the universe's processing power (as a founder of the world she was given de facto control of a continuously-growing zone of the processor network as well) to make forbidden first contact with the life of planet lambert. he believes this is necessary because he has seemingly lost the ability to pause the autoverse simulation or slow it down past a constant multiple of the size of the processor network it occupies. durham is worried that the rules of their simulated universe are breaking down. what they discover together is that the growing and intellectually voracious population of planet lambert has exceeded the combined intelligence of the inhabitants of the remainder of the tvc universe, and that lambert in its autoverse has ceased to be defined as the tvc universe's simulation. rather, the lambertians have been considering a new set of hypotheses, interpretations of the evidence present to them, which do not require their universe to have been created in maria's original garden of eden configuration. as such, the tvc universe's processor networks, which had previously done the work of simulating the autoverse for the inhabitants of permutation city, were now progressively being redefined in ways which prevented them from interfering with the existence of the autoverse in ways unprecedented under these newly self-consistent interpretations of its terms of existence – the tvc universe was being overwritten into a system existing solely as a byproduct of the self-perpetuation of the autoverse, and its inhabitants on planet lambert had interpreted it to be so. durham, maria, and some other companions quickly launch an emergency expedition into the autoverse to attempt to convince the lambertians of the validity of the creator hypothesis and its methodological perferentiality over their own newly formulated theory. unfortunately, the lambertians reject their presentation of the creator theory of the autoverse on the grounds that a system such as the tvc universe, capable of simulating their own universe, would have to be infinitely sized or infinitely expanding, which they consider to be unparsimonious. shortly after failing to convince planet lambert of the creator theory, the lambertians inform them of the discovery a set of field equations with a stable solution for each of their universe's elements; furthermore, initial studies on the equations show that they predict the spontaneous instantiation of matter at high temperatures, enabling their world to come into existence without requiring the garden of eden maria had initially designed. to the alarm of its citizens, permutation city and eventually the entire tvc processor-network begins to collapse into nothingness, interpreted out of existence by the lambertians whose reality no longer requires a maker, there being a 'better' solution that has superseded its possibility. as permutation city becomes corrupted and the tvc universe begins to suffer spontaneous systemic failures, durham and maria inform the inhabitants of the various founders' computing blocks of the situation while preparing a new tvc garden of eden based on the original to launch in their universe's final moments, though durham initially declines to board it himself, saying he has become exhausted with the number of times he was awoken in new realities and would be unable to cope with experiencing it again. ultimately, however, maria convinces him to change his mind (literally reconfiguring it to desire escape) and together they leave, pledging to discover the underlying rules that

norman maclean and laird robinson, in an attempt to forensically analyze the mann gulch fire, brought together multiple sources, including the official report of the united states forest service of the fire, the testimony of the four men who fought the fire and lived, and the research and report of robert jansson and harry t. gisborne (who would suffer a fatal heart attack at mann gulch two months later trying to get to the bottom of the tragedy). jansson was ranger of the helena national forest's canyon ferry district, the area that included mann gulch, on duty the day of the fire. maclean and laird also took walter rumsey and robert sallee, the only two living survivors of the fire team (as survivor wag dodge died in 1955), back to the scene of the fire in 1978, hoping that walking the ground again would help solve some of the missing pieces. additionally, laird and maclean would use the modern fire lab and their mathematical analysis (advances in fire methodology not available in 1949), to search for answers to the fire. with all of these pieces, several trips to mann gulch, and ideas bantered back and forth between each other, bud moore, ed heilman, rich rothermel, frank albini, and other members of the u.s. forest service forest fire investigators, maclean and laird came to new conclusions on the fire's events: that the wind went in the opposite direction than was originally thought possible, and once the fire got started, it created its own unique weather system (which few thought possible before this research). it was always assumed that the wind was traveling south, or upstream, on the missouri river at that time of day. instead, they proved that the wind was traveling north, or downriver, and that the top of the ridge (which juts out as the river bends sharply to the northwest and separates mann gulch and meriwether canyon) split this downriver wind in two. these two separate-smaller winds then re-converged (on the other side of the ridge) in the heart of the gulch (at right-angles). this convergence combined with massive heat, produced by the fire and the hot august afternoon. additionally, the vegetation pattern played a part in how the fire developed and took the lives of the men. the south side of the gulch was of the mountains, with taller forested trees, but the north side of the gulch was of the plains, with smaller trees and dense grasses. this combination of contrasting vegetation, heat, air currents, and right-angle winds, would cause the fire to change direction instantly, trapping and killing most of the fire fighters in its path. ||| 4 ||| 4
when the hrum (an evil race) arrive in a country (good guys) farsala, some serious stuff goes down. kavi is a peasant peddler selling bronze goods plated in gold and he holds a grudge against the deghans. when he was a young apprentice to a man in the city of mazad, a deghan came in looking for a remarkable sword and is willing to pay an astronomical price for it, but does not have the money with him. kavi grabs for the sword, but the deghan pulls and scars his right hand. a year later, the deghan returns for the swords pay, and throws in a bonus amount "for his troubles". the cut cripples him with an injury that still pains him years later. while kavi is running from a city where he is found to be selling false gold items, he is caught up in high commander merahb's plan. he is to visit the cottage where soraya is staying to supply her with the goods and news that a deghass is accustomed to, and he is to do it like an obedient peasant should. but while he is on his usual rounds of the northern mining towns selling second rate iron goods to the country folk, he is captured by hrum scouts who have infiltrated farsala unknown. to save his own life kavi agrees to turn traitor to farsala and spy for the hrum. he also believes that the hrum will be better rulers of farsala than the deghans. when the hrum arrive in farsala the deghans and their unstoppable charge is ready to meet them. seconds before the wall of horses slams into the hrum's front line, spears five yards long and as thick as saplings appear throughout the hrum line. the deghans' charge is dissolved and half of their army is killed in their initial charge. jiaan is thrown from his horse and is knocked unconscious. he also thinks he broke his collar bone. during this time the farsalan army is being driven back to their camp. when jiaan wakes up, all he sees is his father attempting to save his army and challenge the hrum's champion to a life or death duel for victory or defeat. before commander merahb could do anything else, he is shot by four arrows. then, attempting to get up, he gets shot with another volley of arrows that kills him. with the high commander dead and the farsalan army defeated and virtually non-existent, jiaan has to scrounge up an army of peasants and try to defeat an empire that spans half of the known world. ||| 2 ||| 2
twelve-year-old margaret rose kane is sent to summer camp in the adirondack mountains while her parents visit peru, the first time she has neither vacationed with them nor lived downtown with her great-uncles alex and morris rose. she is a new girl at camp talequa, placed in a cabin with six "meadowlarks" who return every summer, and she is the victim of their hazing or "pranks". as a result, she does not follow the directions of the camp proprietress, mrs. kaplan. after the first of four weeks, uncle alex travels by bus and rescues her. mrs. kaplan states that there can be no refund. however, uncle alex elicits lunch and a long automobile ride home, chauffeured by camp handyman jake kaplan, the adult son of the proprietress. margaret lives the rest of vacation with the uncles. for 45 years they have constructed three towers of scrap metal, glass, and ceramic in their small back yard at 19 schuyler place, former company housing that the tappan glass works long ago sold to its workers or to immigrants such as the roses. the uncles have remained through old town's decline and recent gentrification, but the new homeowning gentry have petitioned to have the towers demolished. margaret spurs and leads a belated fight to save them after the uncles have lost their last battle and given up hope. she plots initially with young jake kaplan. she personally recruits to the cultural preservation committee. she does this through their mothers who still live in epiphany, two adults who were friends of her own mother and neighbors of the towers as children, art museum director peter vanderwaal and infinitel (a telephone company) attorney loretta bevilacqua. with jake she must handle phase one: stop the demolition. on loretta's advice she buys the towers for a dollar; on her own, she occupies them. finally jake must drag his mother and the meadowlarks from camp telaqua into the fray. phases two and three and the epilogue comprise fewer than 20 pages.the outcasts, ch. 27–30 (pages 278–96 in the aladdin edition). occupation with mass media publicity bought time. peter who knew the towers as masterpieces of outsider art mustered academic opinions in support. loretta, who recognized their potential function, persuaded infinitel to buy them. they were moved to a new hilltop park above campus and topped with cellular phone antennas. margaret's triumph was bittersweet: she anticipated sharing it with her returning parents but saw that their love had ended and her family would soon break up. tower hill became a suburban housing development. ||| 7 ||| 2
the plot opens with a faux email addressed to nigel macdonald, listing a job offer. it is later learned that this email is for a work-at-home programmer position at hayek associates plc. it is then learned that a cybercrime has been committed in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (mmorpg) avalon four. a robbery of several thousand euros worth of "prestige items" occurs in the game's central bank, led by a band of orcs and a "dragon for fire support." it is later noticed that this seemingly simple incident has deep implications - both financial (hayek stock price) and logistical (compromised cryptographic keys), which sets the stage for the latter half of the novel. the main story is then divided between police chapters as sue, investigation sections as elaine, and programmer and gamer geek sections as jack. initially separate storylines, the three inevitably join forces to combat a much larger conspiracy that hinges on international espionage and counterterrorism. these initial segments track the bank robbery and mystery man, nigel macdonald, who is revealed as a shadow identity created from jack reed's credentials as a programmer and gamer. eventually, it is discovered that the entirety of the european network backbone—including its root keyservers -- has been compromised by chinese hackers. it is more or less at this point that the wool is removed from the reader's eyes that "it's no longer a game," while jack and elaine develop a romance between action segments. using the game spooks as a sock puppet for real espionage missions, jack and elaine are sent to uncover the identity of a mole inside hayek associates, which is subsequently revealed to be a front for the government. the mole is said to have leaked cryptographic keys to "team red", or chinese interests, through a blacknet. for contrast, the european protagonists are called simply, "team blue". it is at this point that the stage is set for the final confrontation. using nigel's shadow identity as bait for team red's mole, elaine and jack successfully expose and capture marcus hackman, who is revealed to be the mole and main antagonist. it is then revealed that hackman had staged the whole thing in order to use strategic put options to earn €26 million when his own company, hayek associates, took the fall for the initial robbery sequence. jack is shot twice in the chest during this exchange, but is seen recovering in a hospital bed by the end of the book. the novel closes with an email addressed to hackman that resembles a 419 scam from a nigerian banker, implying that is where he hid the money. ||| 2 ||| 6
monsieur bibot is a self-centered wealthy dentist. he lives alone in paris, france, in a fancy apartment with his dog, marcel, whom he mistreats, often by beating him over little things, such as sitting on furniture, and he often drags marcel around town as part of his "walks". everything in his life seems quite satisfactory until an impoverished old woman stops by his office to get her tooth extracted. he seems to almost enjoy inflicting pain in this woman. after removing the tooth with a pair of pliers, and about to give a prescription for the painkillers, bibot is upset when the woman can't pay his fee in cash. instead, she pays him by giving him two figs which she claims will make his dreams come true. naturally, bibot scoffs at the thought of magical figs, and refuses to give her the painkillers. later that evening, bibot proceeds to eat one of the figs as a midnight snack. the old woman is right: bibot finds himself walking marcel in paris in his underwear, stared at by the passers-by, and the eiffel tower has drooped over; everything in the dream that he had last night has come true. horrified and embarrassed by this mishap, bibot vows to hypnotize himself to control his dreams so that he may become the richest man on earth. this typically self-centered plan involves ditching marcel, who he has continued to harm in more ways than one, for a string of great danes from a dream he had the night before. but one day, when bibot is preparing dinner, the dog gobbles up the second fig sitting on the table. bibot is furious and chases the dog around the house. heartbroken over the fig, bibot goes to sleep. the next morning, however, bibot wakes up underneath his bed - as the dog. needless to say, bibot is horrified and realizes that the dog was dreaming about finally getting his revenge on his cruel master all along. marcel, who's now in bibot's form, tells bibot it's time for his walk. bibot tries to yell, but all he can do is bark. ||| 2 ||| 0
ray richardson and his top team of architects have developed a super-smart building for yue-kong yu's business, the yu corporation. it is very much self-standing. it can clean itself, uses holograms as greeters in the reception, controls the lifts, toilets, and offices, and digitizes everyone's voice on entry, to allow them to use voice activated services in the building such as lifts and doors. the whole system was given the name abraham. another key feature of abraham was its ability to replicate itself, to adapt to modern office needs and objectives. this, however becomes a problem, when, before office work even starts in the gridiron, abraham start creating a new program named isaac. this is deleted by computer programmers yojo and beech, with beech actually reluctant to do so. shortly after this, however, members of the gridiron team begin to be suspiciously killed. these seem to be the fault of the protesters against the building who are outside, and cheng peng fei is arrested on suspicion of one of the murders. then, a routine inspection of the gridiron involving ray richarson and his entire team (including jenny bao), ends in the whole group being locked in, and two policemen from lapd homicide coming to inspect the murder of sam glieg. after several more deaths from the team, bob beech discovers that during the self-replication that abraham started, another program was created in the process, namely, ishmael. this program escaped the deletion process by integrating itself with a video game which was on the gridiron's system. ishmael now believes that he is in a game, and the objective is to kill all human players before one escapes, or before time runs out. the majority of the team are killed, leaving mitch, jenny, helen, and frank to escape the gridiron moments before it destroys itself (time has run out). ishmael, however, had e-mailed himself to an unknown location, thus saving himself from the destruction of the building. ||| 5 ||| 5

the story takes place about 2015 ad, against a background of an overpopulated earth, whose dysfunctional society is clearly an attempt to extrapolate into the future the rapid social changes taking place in the u.s. during the 1960s. ancient billionaire johann sebastian bach smith is dying, and wants to have his brain transplanted into a new body. smith advertises an offer of a million dollars for the donation of a body from a brain-dead patient. coincidentally, his beautiful young female secretary, eunice branca, is murdered, so her body is used, since smith never thought to place any restriction on the sex of the donor. he is rechristened joan eunice smith. for reasons never made clear, eunice's personality continues to co-inhabit the body. (whether eunice's personality is real or a figment of johann's imagination is addressed but never fully resolved in the novel.) joan and eunice agree never to reveal her continued existence, fearing that they would be judged insane and locked up. the two of them speculate that it may have something to do with the supposed ability of animals to remember things using rna rather than the nervous system. (at the time the book was published, biologist j.v. mcconnell had done a series of experiments in which he taught a behavior to flatworms, ground them up, and fed them to other flatworms, which supposedly exhibited the same behavior. mcconnell's experiments were later discredited, but ideas drawn from them were used in science fiction by several authors, including heinlein, larry niven, joe haldeman and dean koontz.) however, joan and eunice decide that this possible explanation is irrelevant, and near the end of the book, a third personality, that of joan's new husband, joins them by means that can only be explained via delusion, religion or mysticism, not science. ||| 5 ||| 5

for morgan. they move morgan to a magically-warded storage unit in an upscale neighborhood with frequent police patrols. dresden goes to council headquarters in edinburgh, where he informs the merlin that he wants to find the killer, who quietly accepts his help. once dresden is back in chicago he enlists the help of murphy to accompany him to the storage unit. the hideout is attacked by binder, a mercenary named for his use of bound demons. after a large attack and outnumbered, dresden draws a circle around murphy and himself for protection from the demons. while occupying binder, molly and morgan, veiled, draw out a circle around the demons defeating them and turning into ecto-plasm. in the confusion, thomas disappears. now cornered, binder begins to run away as murphy runs him down tackles him and arrests him for questioning. dresden takes the others through a nevernever shortcut and they head back to the safety of his apartment. dresden invites luccio to accompany him on a visit to lara raith and accuse her of complicity. before lara can retaliate, the mansion is attacked by the naagloshii who trashes the mansion and exterminates raith's entire security team. facing dresden and lara, it demands morgan in exchange for thomas' safe return. realizing he needs far more strength to combat the skinwalker, dresden decides to perform a sanctum invocation to the mysterious island of power in lake michigan (site of the finale in small favor). the sanctum invocation involves summoning and fighting the spirit, genius loci, of the island. after besting the spirit, dresden conducts the ritual and names the spirit "demonreach". despite this, dresden, aware that he can't fight each fight one at a time, calls the council, house raith, and the naagloshii, convincing each that morgan is on the island or that the island is where they will meet to discuss further strategy. on the island, lara raith and the representatives of the senior council (ebenezer mccoy, listens-to-wind, and ancient mai) are displeased to see each other. before dresden can explain the complex chain of cats-paws, they are attacked by madeline raith, binder, and binder’s demons. the murderer is on the island, but is working with someone else on a second front on the island. dresden uses his connection to demonreach and the island to direct the wardens and vampires in combat. dresden and the alphas are ambushed by madeline and binder, but are supported by lara, who kills madeline. dresden defeats binder, who gives him madeline's cell phone. in exchange, dresden lets binder go free. while fighting the naagloshii, thomas is thrown into the cabin with molly and morgan. tortured by the skinwalker beyond his energy reserves, thomas is starving. molly activates a crystalline force field to prevent thomas from eating them. dresden puts up a fight that keeps even the naagloshii on the defensive but eventually collapses from exhaustion. listens-to-wind then arrives and drives off the naagloshii. lara collects thomas, promises to take care of him, and leaves. since the white council didn’t actually see the murderer, it is still politically expedient to charge morgan for the crime. dispirited and out of options, morgan surrenders. dresden attends morgan's trial, held in the underground of scotland. he testifies that the nevernever gateway into chicago was staked out by his dog, mouse, and a private detective who photographed everyone entering and leaving. since mouse is a foo dog, ancient mai and others on the council accept mouse as a reliable, incorruptible witness. the photo shows a very highly-placed clerk named peabody coming through the gateway. dresdeen reveals that peabody has also been influencing virtually everyone on the council by use of magically poisoned ink. at this, peabody smashes a jar, releasing a mistfiend spirit mixed with mordite. the spiritm, drawn to the light that many wizards summon by reaction, kills everyone it touches. in the panic, peabody escapes using safe words he implanted in minds of the recently-recruited wardens, rendering them mute and paralyzed. dresden pursues peabody as the merlin contains the mistfiend. attempting to escape, peabody opens a way into the nevernever. overpowering dresden, peabody is about to kill him when morgan arrives and kills peabody with luccio's gun, but the strain reopens morgan's wounds fatally. morgan then explains that it was anastasia luccio who actually killed lafortier, under the influence of peabody, and morgan acted to protect her. morgan then passes away. in the aftermath, gregori cristos fills lafortier’s senior council seat. the merlin had rigged the election to appease cristos and his faction and prevent a council schism. since cristos is probably a member of the black council, they managed to place one of their own on the senior council despite everyone’s efforts to the contrary. during a respite, luccio approaches dresden, and reveals that her romantic feelings for dresden were most likely manufactured by peabody’s subtle influences, and ends the relationship. murphy runs the numbers on madeline’s cell phone. there are repeated calls to restaurants in algiers and egypt - probable locations of black council activity. dresden and ebenezar speak after the council meeting. ebenezar is slowing drumming up support, quietly, from those who believe in the black council. they have to be silent since the merlin denies the existence of such a group and proposing such a thing could be considered treason. they accept this and then decide to call themselves the "grey council". dresden contacts lara and asks to see thomas, who explains that the naagloshii had tortured him, and forced him to fatally feed on several women. after repeated fatal feedings, he now views everyone as food, and comments that his sister is proud of him. however, thomas still has feelings for justine and smiles at harry before he leaves.

the novel takes place in february 1983. clarice starling, a young fbi trainee, is asked to carry out an errand by jack crawford, the head of the fbi division that draws up psychological profiles of serial killers. starling is to present a questionnaire to brilliant forensic psychiatrist and cannibalistic sociopath, hannibal lecter. lecter is serving nine consecutive life sentences in a maryland mental institution for a series of brutal murders. crawford's real intention, however, is to try and solicit lecter's assistance in the hunt for a serial killer dubbed "buffalo bill", whose modus operandi involves kidnapping overweight women, starving them for about three or four days, and then killing and skinning them, before dumping the bodies in nearby rivers. the nickname was started by kansas city homicide, as a joke that "he likes to skin his humps." throughout the investigation, starling periodically returns to lecter in search of information, and the two form a strange relationship in which he offers her cryptic clues in return for information about her unhappy childhood as an orphan. when bill's sixth victim is found in west virginia, starling helps crawford perform the autopsy. starling finds a moth pupa in the throat of the victim, and just as lecter predicted, she has been scalped. triangular patches of skin have also been taken from her shoulders. furthermore, autopsy reports indicate that bill killed her within four days of her capture, much faster than his earlier victims. on the basis of lecter's prediction, starling believes that he knows who buffalo bill really is. she also asks why she was sent to fish for information on buffalo bill without being told she was doing so; crawford explains that if she had had an agenda, lecter would never have spoken up. starling takes the pupa to the smithsonian, where it is eventually identified as the black witch moth, which would not naturally occur where the victim was found. in tennessee, catherine baker martin, daughter of senator ruth martin, is kidnapped. within six hours, her blouse is found on the roadside, slit up the back: buffalo bill's calling card. crawford is advised that no less than the president of the united states has expressed "intense interest" in the case, and that a successful rescue is preferable. crawford estimates they have three days before catherine is killed. starling is sent to lecter with the offer of a deal: if he assists in catherine's rescue and buffalo bill's capture, he will be transferred out of the asylum, something he was continually longed for. however, lecter expresses skepticism at the genuineness of the offer. after starling leaves, lecter reminisces on the past, recalling a conversation with benjamin raspail, a former patient whom he later murdered. raspail, during that therapy session, explained the death of a sailor named klaus at the hands of raspail's jealous former lover, jame gumb, who then used klaus' skin to make an apron. raspail also revealed that gumb had an epiphany upon watching a moth hatch. lecter's ruminations are interrupted when dr. frederick chilton - the asylum's administrator and lecter's nemesis - steps in. a listening device allowed him to record starling's offer, and chilton has found out that crawford's deal is a lie. he offers one of his own: if lecter reveals buffalo bill's identity, he will indeed get a transfer to another asylum, but only if chilton gets credit for getting the information from him. lecter insists that he'll only give the information to senator martin in person, in tennessee. chilton agrees. unknown to chilton, lecter has previously hidden under his tongue a paperclip and some parts of a pen, both of which were mistakenly given to him by untrained orderlies over his many years at the asylum. he fashions the pen pieces and paperclip into an improvised lockpick, which he later uses to pick his handcuff locks. in tennessee, lecter toys with senator martin briefly, enjoying the woman's anguish, but eventually gives her some information about buffalo bill: his name is william "billy" rubin, and he has suffered from elephant ivory anthrax, a knifemaker's disease. he also provides an accurate physical description. the name, however, is a red herring: bilirubin is a pigment in human bile and a chief coloring agent in human feces, which the forensic lab compares to the color of chilton's hair. starling tries one last time to get information from lecter as he is about to be transferred. he offers a final clue - "we covet what we see everyday" - and demands to hear her worst memory. starling reveals that, after her father's death, she was sent to live with a cousin on a sheep ranch. one night, she discovered the farmer slaughtering the spring lambs, and fled in terror. the farmer caught and sent her to an orphanage, where she spent the rest of her childhood. lecter thanks her, and the two share a brief moment of connection before chilton forces her to leave. later on, she deduces from lecter's clue that buffalo bill knew his first victim. shortly after this, lecter escapes by killing and eviscerating his guards, using one of their faces as a mask to fool paramedics. starling continues her search for buffalo bill, eventually tracking him down and killing him and rescuing catherine. she is made a full-fledged fbi agent, and receives a congratulatory telegram from lecter, who hopes that "the lambs have stopped screaming". ||| 6 ||| 6
:... continued from rider at the gate. fisher and cloud escort the goss children halfway up rogers peak to evergreen village with harper's riderless nighthorse, spook, in pursuit. fisher tells the local riders about the fall of tarmin village and the presence of spook, but does not reveal the arrest of the goss brothers nor the role brionne played in tarmin's demise. fisher is lodged in the rider camp, the unconscious brionne with darcey schaffer, the village doctor, and carlo and randy with van mackey, the village blacksmith. the news of tarmin's fall is devastating to evergreen because all its supplies come from there, but many of the villagers see the disaster as an opportunity to seize and occupy the vacant property in tarmin village in the spring. one night spook enters the ambient and disturbs the horses and riders in the rider camp. fisher knows that brionne has woken up and is <calling>. the next morning ridley takes fisher out the gates to find spook, but when they are some distance from the village, ridley points his rifle at fisher and demands the truth. fisher is relieved to be able to finally unburden himself and tells ridley everything he knows. earnest rigs, a miner, arrives at the doctor's house for treatment and sees and is entranced by brionne. that night schaffer and brionne are awoken by a noise on the roof and a banging at the door. the next day, schaffer finds blood splattered outside her house, and rigs is missing. a crowd gathers, including the goss boys and the village marshal. carlo is accused of murdering rigs and, scared that his arrest in tarmin will become known, runs away. the marshal orders that carlo be stopped, and a group of miners pursue him. when carlo reaches the village gate, his only escape is out the village. spook finds carlo in the wild and immediately adopts him. fisher and cloud begin searching for carlo and see him riding spook. suspecting that spook may have gone rogue, fisher pursues them. when he catches up with them he sees a threatening shadow in the trees above them and shoots it. at the same time, stuart and chang, out looking for fisher and the goss children, find fisher and carlo. they search for the creature fisher shot but find instead a large nest in which appear to be human bones. no creature of this size and ability had ever been encountered before, and they conclude that it must have come from the unexplored side of the mountain, probably attracted by the noise in the ambient from the swarm that overran tarmin. then the riders hear evergreen's bells calling for help, and set off for the village. at evergreen, the breakthrough bells are ringing and the riders enter the village to investigate. they find the gate man ripped to shreds in his watch tower and track the intruder to the houses. when the riders hear brionne <calling> they realise that she is controlling the beast. they go to schaffer's house where, through the door, they try to persuade the doctor to drug the girl. inside brionne opens the underground passage door to reveal a huge ape-like creature. it picks up brionne and when schaffer tries to intervene, it hurls the doctor against the wall, killing her. like a rider and a nighthorse, brionne and the beast connect. they climb to the roof and disappear over the wall. all the riders spend the rest of the winter in the rider camp and discuss their plans for the spring. stuart reveals the presence of the gold in the crashed truck, and fisher and carlo agree to go to anveney to request supplies from cassivey to retrieve the gold. stuart and chang take on the responsibility of escorting villagers down to tarmin. of brionne and the beast there is no sign, not even in the ambient. clearly they have returned to the other side of the mountain. ||| 5 ||| 2
abdulrahman zeitoun is a muslim who grew up in syria. after a few years of apprenticeship in the syrian port city of jableh, zeitoun spent twenty years working at sea as a muscleman, engineer and fisherman. during this time he traveled the world and eventually settled in the united states in 1988. there he met his wife, kathy — a native of baton rouge who had converted to islam — with whom he founded their business, zeitoun painting contractors, llc. in late august, 2005, as hurricane katrina approached the city, kathy and their four children left new orleans for baton rouge. zeitoun stayed behind to watch over their home, ongoing job sites and rental properties. once the storm made landfall, their neighborhood (although miles from the nearest levees) was flooded up to the second floor of most houses. zeitoun began to explore the city in a secondhand canoe, distributing what supplies he had, ferrying neighbors to higher ground, checking on his tenants, and caring for abandoned dogs. on september 14, zeitoun and three companions were arrested at one of zeitoun's rental houses by a mixed group of national guardsmen, local police and police from out-of-state. although the men were not immediately charged with any crimes, they were detained in a makeshift jail in a greyhound bus station for three days time before being transferred to elayn hunt correctional center in nearby st. gabriel, louisiana. zeitoun was held at hunt for 20 more days without having stood trial. during that time he was refused medical attention and the use of a phone to alert his family of his predicament. people often say hurricanes are one of the most destructive forces on the planet. they destroy poverty and devastate lives. however, there is another powerful and destructive force that can be equally frightening—intolerance. “zeitoun”, written by dave eggers, tells the story of abdulrahman zeitoun, a syrian-american business owner who chose to ride out hurricane katrina in new orleans in order to watch over his home and business. what happened to zeitoun in prison is a shameful experience that occurred when two destructive forces, katrina and racism, collided with catastrophic results. the book says that when zeitoun asked the guards to call kathy, he was rejected. and when kathy knew zeitoun was in prison and the guards didn’t allow her to visit him. this worried zeitoun’s brother “a syrian in an american prison in 2005—this was not be trifled with. abdulrahman had to be seen. he had to be freed immediately. the justice system should have allowed zeitoun his phone call from the start, but he wrongly was never given one. post 9/11 was an unfair time for people from the middle east. they were discriminated against and suspected for almost anything anywhere. the justice system would treat them unfairly like zeitoun. kathy was outraged she couldn't be told the location of the jail, but once she got the press involved they told her right away. however, they didn't allow her or anyone else testifying in the defense of zeitoun in the court hearing. innocent people can be thrown in jail. moreover, the book also says that when zeitoun was released, he and kathy pursued information on the reasoning behind his arrest and the jail he stayed at. the government worried that "terrorists might target evacuation routes, creating 'mass panic' and 'loss of public confidence in the government'" that is to say, after 9/11, it seemed like the government, or at least george bush's top priority, was terrorism. there are terrorists out there, but that doesn't mean government should put all of their resources toward finding them. ||| 4 ||| 4
it's been some time since the end of the american civil war. the gun club, a society based in baltimore and dedicated to the design of weapons of all kinds (especially cannons), meets when impey barbicane, its president, calls them to support his idea: according to his calculations, a cannon can shoot a projectile so that it reaches the moon. after receiving the whole support of his companions, a few of them meet to decide the place from where the projectile will be shot, the dimensions and makings of both the cannon and the projectile, and which kind of powder are they to use. an old enemy of barbicane, a captain nicholl of philadelphia, designer of plate armor, declares that the enterprise is absurd and makes a series of bets with barbicane, each of them of increasing amount over the impossibility of such feat. the first obstacle, the money, and over which nicholl has bet 1000 dollars, is raised from most countries in america and europe, in which the mission reaches variable success (while the usa gives 4 million dollars, england doesn't give a farthing, being envious of the united states in matters of science), but in the end nearly five and a half million dollars are raised, which ensures the financial feasibility of the project. after deciding the place for the launch (stone's hill in "tampa town", florida; predating kennedy space center's placement in florida by almost 100 years; verne gives the exact position as 27°7' northern latitude and 5°7' western longitude, of course relative to the meridian of washington that is ), the gun club travels there and starts the construction of the columbiad cannon, which requires the excavation of a and circular hole, which is made in the nick of time, but a surprise awaits barbicane: michel ardan, a french adventurer, plans to travel aboard the projectile. during a meeting between ardan, the gun club, and the inhabitants of florida, nicholl appears and challenges barbicane to a duel. the duel is stopped when ardan—having been warned by j. t. maston, secretary of the gun club—meets the rivals in the forest where they have agreed to duel. meanwhile, barbicane finds the solution to the problem of surviving the incredible acceleration that the explosion would cause. ardan suggests that barbicane and nicholl travel with him in the projectile, and the offer is accepted. in the end, the projectile is successfully launched, but the destinies of the three astronauts are left inconclusive. the sequel, around the moon, deals with what happens to the three men in their travel from the earth to the moon. ||| 5 ||| 5
we find out at the start of the novel that in the previous book the soul eaters marked torak with the soul eater symbol. this is discovered and torak is set to be cast out from the clans, unless his own clan, the wolf clan, decides he is innocent. when the wolf clan arrives, the leader says that his mother announced him 'clanless'. this has never happened before, but as torak has no clan to decide his innocence, he becomes an outcast. he leaves the clans with wolf. renn repeatedly tries to help him, but torak won't let her as if anyone sees torak they are supposed to kill him. torak attempts to cut out the soul eater mark from his chest and, thinking it has worked, he goes back to the raven camp and watches them. saeunn, the raven clan's mage, says that there is a soul eater among them, so torak flees, knowing that he is the soul eater of which she speaks. while in hiding, he suffers from a kind of madness called soul sickness, and attackes wolf with fire. meanwhile, renn and bale meet up and decide to find torak and prove his innocence, even though in doing so they are breaking clan law. renn sends help to torak in the form of two ravens (named rip and rek by torak). while torak is recovering his reason, seshru the viper mage, a soul eater, uses her powers to draw him to her so as to control him (he is a spirit walker and therefore controlling him would supply her with even greater power). seshru is revealed to be renn's mother. meanwhile, renn realizes that a giant flood is coming and encourages torak to spread the word and therefore prove his innocence. torak therefore tells fin-kedinn, and the clans flee. torak gets into a fight with a boy from the boar clan, but then climbs up a tree to escape the coming flood. the boar clan boy hears the water coming and tries to climb the tree too, but he cannot reach the first branch so torak jumps down to help him. torak then finds he cannot climb back up the tree, and he and wolf are swept away by the water. when he wakes up, all the clans are there, and when seshru appears torak shows the clans that destroying him will not help them in their struggle against the soul eaters, and they accept him back. bale uses renn's bow to kill seshru, and she dies with the fire opal in hand and thus both die as one. fr:le banni (chroniques des temps obscurs) ||| 2 ||| 2

pulp is a pulp fiction novel which acts also as a meta-pulp. pulp comments on the obsessions of the pulp fiction genre, making fun of itself as stereotypical of the genre in the grimiest form. bukowski dedicates the story to "bad writing", as bukowski did not plan his mystery novel well and frequently wrote nicky belane into holes from which he could not escape. bukowski wrote some of his most violent, cynical, sarcastic, and shocking work during the final months of his life. many critics have agreed this novel exemplifies bukowski showing an acceptance of his own pending mortality. a convoluted detective story about a hard-boiled private eye who solves his cases by waiting them out, pulp evokes raymond chandler, an author who lived in los angeles and set stories there, as did bukowski. the novel also bears similarity to some works by dashiell hammett; and the name of character nicky belane rhymes suggestively with the name of author mickey spillane as well as casablanca's main character rick blaine. ||| 6 ||| 6

half a million years ago and 50 light-years from earth, a star in the constellation draco turns supernova, and the star's remnant becomes a neutron star. the radiation from the explosion causes mutations in many earth organisms, including a group of hominina that become the ancestors of homo sapiens. the star's short-lived plasma jets are lop-sided because of anomalies in its magnetic field, and set it on a course passing within 250&nbsp;astronomical units of the sun. in 2020&nbsp;ce, human astronomers detect the neutron star, call it "dragon's egg", and send an expedition to explore it. the star contains about half of a solar mass of matter, compressed into a diameter of about , making its surface gravity 67&nbsp;billion times that of earth. its outer crust, compressed to about 7,000&nbsp;kg per cubic centimeter, is mainly iron nuclei with a high concentration of neutrons, around 3000&nbsp;bc dragon's egg cools enough to allow a stable equivalent of "chemistry", in which "compounds" are constructed of nuclei bound by the strong force, rather than of earth's atoms bound by the electromagnetic force. as the star's chemical process are about one&nbsp;million times faster than earth's, self-replicating "molecules" appear shortly and life begins on the star. as the star continues to cool, more complex life evolves, until plant-like organisms appear around 1000&nbsp;bc. one lineage of these later became the first "animals", the earliest of these stealing seedpods from sessile organisms and some later lineages becoming predators. the adults of the star's most intelligent species, called cheela (no flexion for gender or number), have about the same mass as an adult human. however, the extreme gravity of dragon's egg compresses the cheela to the volume of a sesame seed, but with a flattened shape about high and about in diameter. their eyes are wide. such minute eyes can see clearly only in ultraviolet and, in good light, the longest wavelengths of the x-ray band. {| class="wikitable" style="font-size:80%;

the novel focuses on five separate stories. the first story concentrates on the adventure that anakin solo, tahiri veila, and corran horn all have. on a routine cargo pickup for the errant venture on the planet eriadu, anakin and tahiri encounter a jedi named kelbis nu, who is being attacked by yuuzhan vong supporters. despite anakin and tahiri's efforts in helping him, nu dies, but before he does, he is able to whisper to anakin, "yag'dhul." for their trouble, anakin and tahiri are arrested by the pro-vong police of eriadu, but escape and manage to leave the planet in time with corran. however, they can't make it back to the errant venture in time, for it has to respond to a call from luke skywalker himself. luke and his wife mara, meanwhile, are declared by the new republic to be wanted fugitives, in response to the pressure that the yuuzhan vong put on the jedi. what's worse is that as mara carries her and luke's baby, the deadly coomb spore virus that had previously affected her returns, and threatens to kill her and the child. with the help of some of their fellow jedi and the errant venture, they are able to escape coruscant. afterwards, luke sends jaina solo to find and meet up with kyp durron in order to tell him that luke has finally made a decision regarding the stance that the jedi overall should take in the yuuzhan vong war. back with anakin, tahiri, and corran, they are left to escape from the eriadu system by themselves, and when they revert from a hyperspace corridor, they end up in the midst of a yuuzhan vong fleet. they manage to infiltrate one of the vong's ships as the fleet prepares to go into darkspace. they end up in the yag'dhul system, and after a brief battle, anakin, tahiri, and corran escape from the vong's midst in order to rendezvous with the indigenous population. the attacking vong fleet quickly pulls back, and it becomes obvious that they were merely but a recon force for a much larger invasion of yag'dhul. that invasion soon comes as infiltrating yuuzhan vong, led by nom anor, make their move, but despite their actions, the invasion fails in light of the overall vong fleet going into darkspace to deal with another problem elsewhere. that other problem came as a result of jaina solo's meeting with kyp durron. kyp tells jaina that he has scouted the sernpidal for some months now and has discovered the yuuzhan vong have been using the time offered to them in the wake of the galactic invasion's halt in order to build a giant superweapon that could threaten the stability of the new republic. they take it to the republic military, where the likes of general wedge antilles and admiral traest kre'fey take a minimum number of ships to help kyp's forces in taking on the apparent superweapon in sernpidal. in the wake of the republic's attack in the julevian system, it prompted the invasion fleet at yag'dhul to pull back in order to help the defending forces at sernpidal. but their response to the call for help comes too late, as their enemies manage to destroy the apparent superweapon. but in the midst of the supposed superweapon's destruction, jaina discovers that it was merely a developing worldship that had no yuuzhan vong warriors, but civilians. kyp justifies this by saying that it was meant to get back at the vong for attacking the new republic's people. jaina slaps him for this and vows to never help him again. the fourth story of the novel focuses on nen yim, now master shaper in the wake of mezhan kwaad's death in the previous novel, trying vainly to save a dying worldship by using even heretical protocols. her efforts are further hindered when another master shaper named kae kwaad, obviously within the same domain as the late mezhan, forces nen yim to concoct rather ridiculous experiments that do nothing to forward the progress of repairing the dying worldship. desperate to save the worldship, yim accesses the shaper qahsa in order to find out what further protocols can help her in her goal by reaching the legendary eighth cortex of the qahsa. but it turns out that there is no eighth cortex, and that the yuuzhan vong have already reached the pinnacle of their biological technology. yim also reaches the conclusion that the yuuzhan vong's gods also don't exist, just as mezhan kwaad herself proclaimed before her death. kae kwaad then reveals himself to be the shamed one onimi, who is the familiar of the yuuzhan vong's supreme overlord shimrra jamaane himself. shimrra reveals that he knows of yim's heresy, but rather than proceeding to punish her, he allows her to continue her heretical protocols in order to further the vong's war efforts against the new republic. thus, yim drops her efforts in trying to save the doomed worldship. the fifth story of the novel focuses on jacen solo traveling throughout the galaxy trying to avoid yuuzhan vong and their supporters, considering the special bounty that warmaster tsavong lah put on his head. through the solos' adventures in averting death from their enemies, jacen learns to reconcile with his father, han, since their different ideals were what separated them from each other emotionally in the first place. as mara starts to die from the coomb spore virus, luke is able to reach out to her in the force, as well as reaching out to his and mara's child's presence, and they are able to banish the virus from her system as their son, ben skywalker, is born. their friends and allies, including anakin, tahiri (both of whom shared a kiss at yag'dhul that will prove to further their relationship in the future), corran, the other solos, and several others arrive just in time to meet the newborn ben. ||| 5 ||| 5

'never', according to the novel, can be used as a drug by humans. when used, humans are given magic for a short period of time. it's highly addictive; a comparison can be drawn between it and heroin. lolli and dave introduce val to taking "nevermore," as they refer to it. val, like the other squatters, is soon hooked. ravus, despite val's first impressions, is much kinder than he appears. he begins to teach her swordplay and the bond between them strengthens. val's mounting problems and addiction take a nasty turn, and the trust ravus has in her is threatened. many of the seelie court exiles are being poisoned. ravus is blamed for the crime. when ruth arrives, attempting to convince val to come home, she refuses and ruth insists she won't leave without val. val agrees to go home, but says she must say goodbye to ravus before she leaves. she attempts to find him in his alcove, but he is not home, so she finds ruth, lolli and luis by belvedere castle. luis, all the while making sexual thenceforwards with lolli very unexpectedly, informs her dave has angrily stormed off, and they all fall asleep in a terrible state. in the middle of the night, val awakes to see a tree-spirit faerie, who leads her to a festival by the water, where faeries and humans called "sweet tooths" run around freely. ravus arrives, and delirious and half-starved, val kisses him. he is pleased, until mabry arrives as well, and when val realized mabry is the one who killed all the fey. she tries to tell ravus but mabry cuts in, telling ravus val has been stealing his potions, and she flees as he becomes enraged. ruth and val go to find evidence of mabry's murders, and they find a harp in which mabry has strung the hair of those she's killed, including that of tamson, ravus' best friend and mabry's ex-lover. when the hairs are plucked, they sing of their deaths, revealing that mabry is responsible for tamson's death and ravus' exile. the girls also find luis. the three of them come back to the other luis and lolli, and they realize that dave is impersonating luis, uncontrollably high off never he got from mabry after putting poison in ravus' potions for her. dave takes off his glamour, laughing, and falls unconscious. ruth rushes him to the hospital as lolli runs off, and luis and val rush to find ravus so he can cure dave. they find that mabry has cut out ravus' heart, and she runs off to the unseelie court with it. when she leaves, val pulls back the curtains and turn ravus to stone, and val and luis pursue mabry into the unseelie court. she challenges mabry to a first-blood duel for ravus' heart with the glass sword belonging to ravus, and after a moment's decision to never use never again, she fights mabry on talent alone, stabbing mabry in the throat. she and luis rush back to ravus, and after placing his heart back into his chest, he instantly heals. ravus gives luis the tools to go heal his brother, and he and val finally admit their love for one another. eventually, val decides to leave the streets and return home with ruth. she and ravus continually see one another, and val says she plans to go to ny for college so she can see him. the two kiss, and val is happy her life is back to normal, with the exception of having a faerie for a boyfriend and never being able to introduce him to her mother. some fans have pointed out that lolli, dave and luis are similar to lutie-loo, gristle and spike from tithe, respectively. note: in the book roiben and kaye make appearances. silarial and nicnevin are referred to by mabry. ||| 7 ||| 2

when a "simple child" named bran who can run incredibly fast comes to bec's demon-besieged rath, she and a small consignment of warriors go with him, including the chief's son, connla, who is "largely untested" in battle; goll, an old warrior; lorcan and ronan, two teenage twins; fiachna the blacksmith; and orna, a female warrior. during the journey, the group is attacked by demons, but luckily manage to hide near some ancient lodestones which protects them with powerful old magic. eventually, bran leads them to a crannóg, where everyone is dead except a druid, drust. the druid tells them about a tunnel to the demons' world, and how he aims to destroy it. they go with him. during their journey, they encounter many demons, including the terrifying lord loss, with whom bec engages in a battle. she appears to absorb power from him, and after the encounter begins to learn magic at a phenomenal rate. drust gets worried, and asks her for permission to go into her mind (like dervish grady asks grubbs in slawter). he discovers that lord loss had given bec part of his power,(later revealed to the power given by lord loss is the power of the kah gash.) opening up her magical side, though no one knows for what purpose. eventually they arrive at a village, where bec learns about her heritage and that she is part of a clan prone to lycanthropy (this is a link to the garadexes, grubbs' ancestors). after a long journey, they arrive at the cliffs. lord loss appears, intrigued by a chessboard drust got from the elders. he is then thrown out magically, and places a geis (a demon curse) on them. although dismissing it as untrue, the group are immediately affected by the geis; orna is killed by her undead children. they arrive at the coast, where they share a small battle with some demons, and, according to connla, ronan is forced over into the sea and fiachna is fatally infected with demon poison. that night bec and drust use magic to go down into an underwater cave, and they meet the mystical old creatures, who tell them where the tunnel is and how to destroy it. it emerges that a druid or priestess must be sacrificed, which reveals why drust needs bec. back on dry land, while bec and drust are talking about the sacrifice, bran overhears. the group find some horses which help them reach their destination in time, but fiachna is soon abandoned after his wound becomes life-threatening. when they arrive at the demon-guarded tunnel, they find drust's brother brude trapped and part of the entrance. brude opened the tunnel and let the entire demon race loose on the earth to prevent all of ireland converting to christianity. it transpires that drust was motivated because he knew his brother had unleashed the demons. connla betrays the group, revealing he was working for lord loss all along and it was he who caused all the deaths of the others of their party. bec pushes him under a waterfall, breaking his protective spell of demonic blood and allowing the demons to slaughter him. lorcan and goll are also attacked and die in battle. when bec is about to be sacrificed, drust is knifed in the back by bran and bec realizes bran wouldn't let her die. drust tells her to use him as the sacrifice, as he is about to die anyway. when the tunnel is destroyed, brude's mouth starts to close. bec manages to force bran through the closing tunnel at the last moment with the last of her magic, but is trapped as a result. soon after, lord loss appears and tells bec that when she appeared to absorb power from him several days earlier, lord loss had actually intended for that to happen so that she could close the tunnel. this is because lord loss is unique among demons, in that instead of wishing to slaughter all the humans in the world as quickly as possible, he actually prefers to prolong the suffering for as long as possible. if the tunnel had remained open, countless other demons would have passed through and destroyed all of mankind within a matter of weeks, which would have ruined lord loss' "sport". after telling bec this, lord loss reminds her that of the geis that he had placed on her, and that he is bound by his word to kill her. lord loss sets his familiars upon bec, and without any magic to defend herself with, she is utterly defenceless. this book has the same first and last words "screams in the dark." ||| 2 ||| 2
paladin of souls is a sequel to the curse of chalion and is set some three years after the events of that novel. it follows ista, mother of the girl who became royina (queen) in that book and a minor character in it. recovering from the extreme guilt and grief that had marked her as mad while the golden general's curse on her family persisted, she finds herself bored to distraction and restless. to get away from her home town, valenda, and its ugly memories she sets out on a religious pilgrimage with the dy gura brothers (also minor characters from the earlier story) for protection; liss, a feisty and clever courier girl; and dy cabon, a plump priest of the bastard (one of the five gods) as her 'spiritual guide'. the bastard, god of disasters and of things out of season, becomes a larger presence in this novel than was the lady of spring in the curse of chalion; by its end, ista herself has become a saint in his service. (the father of winter, another of the five gods, also makes a brief appearance.) the pilgrimage party is overrun and captured by a troop of roknari raiders from the adjacent principality of jokona, then set free by a patrol from nearby castle porifors. leading the rescuers is arhys, lord of the castle and a very effective warrior indeed—considering that he scarcely eats or drinks, or sleeps except for brief afternoon naps. though she comes to be immensely attracted to him, she realizes in horror that he is the son of a man she had helped murder. another obstacle is arhys's very young and very beautiful wife, cattilara. once in the castle ista discovers another odd man: lord illvin, arhys's half-brother. he is unconscious except for afternoon wakings that match arhys' naps. she has seen him before, though, in a baffling dream that at last makes some sense. as this mystery begins to come clear, castle porifors is besieged by a new force of roknari from jokona that includes its prince, sordso, and his mother, princess joen. the latter is an elderly, minor daughter of the golden general and has accumulated a whole troop of demon-ridden magicians, including her son, all of them controlled by one major magician: herself. as castle porifors and its defenders crumble under magical siege, lord arhys and a picked troop make a night raid that jolts the jokonans but does not dislodge them. only when ista allows herself to walk as a hostage into the princess' lair is the siege ended. the remaining magicians' demons are sent back to the bastard's care, and the remaining loose ends of the story are resolved, with ista's acceptance of the bastard's offer of skills and a job that give use and meaning to the rest of her life. lord illvin comes with the job as a bonus. ||| 2 ||| 2
king turner is in a deep funk after his wife, eleanor, left him. he's fallen in with a pair of reprobates, bill evans and wash gordon, who are more interested in him as the butt of their jokes than as a friend. one night they drag king and a girl named vinnie to a "ranch"—a sort of speakeasy where people smoke "grass". after getting high, king hallucinates that vinnie is his ex-wife and begins chasing her around the room. bill hands him a knife as a lark and tells him to "pin her down." king does exactly that and then flees the room. he finds a sleeping bouncer and steals the man's gun. before he can leave the ranch, a couple police officers arrive, but king manages to sneak past them. king evades pursuit and hides out in the phone booth of a candy store. while there, a police officer enters and walks towards the store's proprietor to buy a numbers ticket, but king, paranoid from the marijuana, thinks the officer is there to arrest him, and responds by gunning the man down. king flees the store and heads to the hotel where his ex-wife is living. eleanor agrees to talk with king in her room. after hearing his story, she tries to calm him down but with little effect. she convinces him to let her order some sandwiches and coffee from room service. on the phone, she tells the clerk that she wants her order fixed "just like the other night," referring to the fact that she'd had sleeping powder added to her coffee to help with insomnia. but before the order can arrive, king grows paranoid that eleanor has betrayed him to the police. when he thinks room service is taking too long, king shoots eleanor and flees the room. with nowhere else to go, he heads back to his apartment, where the police are waiting for him. king escapes onto the ledge of the building. detective spillane, the officer in charge of catching him, follows him out, but before he can save him, king jumps to his death. the book ends with a final twist—back in her apartment vinnie is alive and well, telling a friend about the gag she, bill and wash had pulled on king. bill had only handed king a butter knife, and when king stabbed her, vinnie took a ketchup-soaked piece of bread and squeezed it to simulate blood. vinnie is completely unaware of subsequent events and thinks the whole situation hilarious, though her friend has doubts. the story ends with detective spillane arriving and vinnie's friend thinking, "he's either a bill collector or a plainclothesman ... or maybe a little of both." ||| 3 ||| 6

one thursday afternoon, prof. brade goes to visit his graduate student's laboratory. he finds ralph neufeld dead, having inhaled hydrogen cyanide. (this is perhaps a grim echo of ralph's connection with the holocaust, as hydrogen cyanide was the lethal agent used by the nazis in their gas chambers.) in his experiment, he had somehow used sodium cyanide instead of sodium acetate, both white powders. later, brade is questioned by detective doheny, who is in charge of ralph's case. when he gets home, he reveals to his wife his suspicions that ralph's death was murder. she cautions him not to tell this to anyone, as he would destroy any chance of getting associate professorship and tenure. the next day, he meets with the emeritus cap anson, who seems to blame him for ralph's death. they visit the zoo together, and anson encourages brade to go into comparative biochemistry. brade refuses, saying he wants to continue ralph's work in chemical kinetics. that night, he attends a departmental get-together at chairman littelby's, and becomes so fed up with the other professors blaming him for the death that he puts his job on the line and accuses them back. he is also disrespectful to littelby with a nearly outright demand for tenure. on sunday, he reads through ralph's research notebooks and realizes that ralph's data had been faked, a cardinal sin in chemistry. when doheny returns, he tells him about the faking, suggesting it as a possible motive for suicide. doheny, however, twists it around and says that brade might have been trying to protect his own reputation by hiding the fraud. the next day, after his lectures in the university, he again meets with cap anson, and immediately afterward in the lab, nearly triggers a chemical reaction which would have killed him. now resolved to solve the mystery, he questions student roberta goodhue in the presence of doheny. she admits that she and neufeld had had an argument about the faked data. the only person who could have overheard was cap anson. doheny then tricks anson into revealing that he knows about the attempt on brade's life and anson confesses. ||| 3 ||| 6

with the rise of a corporation-sponsored government, pollution in big cities has reached extreme levels and most (if not all) people's health has been affected in some way. continuing the style used in stand on zanzibar, there is a multi-strand narrative and many characters in the book never meet each other; some characters only appear in one or two vignettes. similarly, instead of chapters, the book is broken up into sections which range from thirty words in length to several pages. the character of austin train in the sheep look up serves a similar purpose to xavier conroy in the jagged orbit or to chad mulligan in stand on zanzibar: he is an academic who, despite predicting and interpreting social change, has become disillusioned by the failure of society to listen. this character is used both to drive the plot and to explain back-story to the reader. by the end of the book rioting and civil unrest sweep the united states, due to a combination of poor health, poor sanitation, lack of food, lack of services, ineffectiveness of services (medical, policing), disillusionment with government/companies, oppressive government, civil unrest, high incidence of birth defects (pollution-induced), and other factors; all services (military, government, private, infrastructure) break down. a housewife in ireland smells smoke, and says to a visiting doctor: "we ought to call the fire brigade, is it a hayrick?" to which the doctor replies, "the brigade would have a long way to go. it's from america. the wind is blowing [from] that way." ||| 5 ||| 5
offit describes the origins and development of claims regarding the mmr vaccine and the vaccine preservative thiomersal, as well as subsequent scientific evidence which has disproved a link with autism. the book discusses possible explanations for the persistence of these claims in the face of scientific evidence to the contrary, as well as the proliferation of potentially risky and unproven treatments for autism. the author takes a critical view of several advocates of a vaccine–autism link, including andrew wakefield, david kirby, mark geier, and boyd haley, raising scientific and, in some cases, ethical and legal concerns. the book also explores divisions within the autism community on the topic of vaccines, as some parents consider the ongoing narrow focus on vaccines a distraction from more scientifically promising avenues of research. in this vein, offit interviews kathleen seidel, a mother of an autistic child who has published investigations critical of those who profit from promoting vaccine–autism claims. offit also touches on the heated and bitter debate surrounding vaccine claims. he describes receiving death threats, hate mail, and threats against his children as a result of his advocacy for vaccine safety. offit declined to do a book tour for autism's false prophets, citing concerns about his physical safety and comparing the intensity of hatred and threats directed at him to that experienced by abortion providers. author's royalties from the book are being donated to the center for autism research at children's hospital of philadelphia. ||| 4 ||| 4

reacher is roaming alone with no objectives, no phone, no address, just the clothes he's wearing and his atm card, when an anonymous deposit is made to his bank account. reacher automatically analyzes the amount, using his math obsession and investigative skills. also obsessed with math, frances neagley (previously seen in without fail) is the sender of $1030.00, which reacher recognises as their old army code, 10-30, for urgent help needed. he meets up with neagley in california and they discover the death of calvin franz, one of nine members of their elite team of ex–army investigators, who are being hunted down one by one. after getting no reply from anyone else, their suspicions rise and neagley convinces him to put the old unit back together. reacher and neagley find that three of the other five members are missing, while stan lowery had a fatal car accident years earlier. they conclude that franz called the others for help with a major problem but left out the remaining four that resided too far away to get to him quickly, apart from reacher, who is famously untraceable. reacher and neagley discover franz's office gutted and trashed but decide the perpetrators didn't find what they were looking for. after further investigation they visit franz's widow and child, angela and charlie. angela notes that when franz told her all about the team, she had felt like franz had been married before, to them. reacher says if people were lucky like the team, they became family, but franz got even luckier with her and charlie, with angela replying, "...but his luck ran out, didn't it?", a reference to the book title. more information on the other team members makes reacher and neagley realise franz was unlikely to be the person who called for help. they meet david o'donnell at their hotel, making three of the team alive. reacher goes to tony swan's workplace, defense contractor new age, in search of information, but is sent away with basically nothing by the hr manager, margaret berenson. following reacher and his team is an unmarked car, which they trap to discourage the driver. after roughing him up they find out the driver is an la county deputy named thomas brant, but outside of his jurisdiction in orange county, ca. the team decides to ditch their rental car for a new one and run into karla dixon. with four of the team now alive, they proceed to source money, cars and weapons. except for reacher, all the team members have "moved onward and upward" from the military, making reacher reconsider his drifting. he is happy for the others' successes but feels as if he is "treading water while the rest are swimming". putting aside onflicting reactions at seeing his team again, reacher focuses on the three missing members, manuel orozco, jorge sanchez and tony swan, and which one was in a situation so bad they couldn't handle it on their own and called for help. the team realizes franz kept his home life completely separate from his business, leading franz to mail any dangerous computer data to himself, with triple backup of refreshed computer usb flash drives on rotating days. they find his flash memory sticks in his business post-office box, crack the password, then review a set of bizarre numbers which they conclude to be scores, and an unfamiliar name "adrian mount" with four aliases. unsurprised, reacher is visited by brant and his boss, curtis mauney, an la county sheriff. but reacher is surprised when mauney tells him that reacher and his team are bait, for whoever killed franz and caused swan, sanchez and orozco to be reported missing. mauney's la sheriffs and las vegas police frequently work together and recent information had linked the dead and the missing with reacher's team. neagley gets a response regarding swan's company new age from diana bond, a staffer for a guy on the house defense committee, that reacher and his team distrust, but they pressure diana for confidential information on new age and its military contracts. mauney later contacts the team with information on jorge sanchez's death and vegas police evidence on adrian mount with five aliases, one more than franz had. sanchez and orozco were partners in a las vegas casino security firm and the team drives to las vegas for clues and answers on sanchez and the still missing orozco. reacher and his team seek out the major casino security directors about the possibility of sanchez and orozco being involved in a large scale internal multi-casino thief network and are told about sanchez's girlfriend, who leads them to orozco's wife and children. an assassination attempt is made on reacher and his team but they kill the assassin and take his car, which reacher recalls from their la hotel. reacher uses the cell phone in the car to return-dial the last number on the call list, telling the man who answers that his assassin failed, the team knows he is behind their unit's dead members and they are coming for him. from las vegas they are told to meet mauney at the hospital, leading reacher to conclude that sanchez is not dead, just severely injured. o'donnell and dixon go to the hospital and reacher and neagley go to find margaret berenson, after they realise that she has been lying to them. they find that new age has been producing state of the art air missiles and pretending to destroy the prototypes, whilst sending them to foreign terrorists. neagley and reacher leave berenson's house after finding out berenson is being blackmailed with harm to her son, and arranging a safe hiding place for them. o'donnell and dixon are captured by mauney's men in the hospital and taken to new age's director, allen lamaison. reacher and neagley track mauney down, take his suitcase containing the terrorists' payment of $65 million, and kill him. at the second new age complex, reacher stows away on the same helicopter as lamaison, where he finds o'donnell and dixon tied up and about to be thrown off and killed the same way that franz, orozco, sanchez and swan were. reacher confronts lamaison just in time, kills his assistant and pushes lamaison out of the helicopter once it is fully one mile above ground level. after the helicopter lands reacher asks the pilot if he flew for each of the murders and after confirmation, reacher kills the pilot also. the one part left is the terrorist weapons buyer, who reacher concludes does not know how to use them. the team finds the one new age staff engineer capable of teaching the terrorist how to use the weapons, and who is being threatened with his daughter's torture. reacher poses as the engineer briefly as the terrorist arrives, then he and neagley tie the terrorist up, leaving him for the special military police to find him. later, the four team members agree to split the money obtained from the bad guys after setting up trust funds for the murdered team members' loved ones, with a donation to peta for tony swan's only family, his dog maisi. reacher eventually receives a deposit for over $100,000 in his account, automatically analyzes it, and thinks the amount is just a boring plain number. he feels disappointed and let down by dixon, the money manager of the group. but the detailed report shows multiple deposits, "101810.18. 10012 ... military police radio code for mission accomplished, twice over. 10-18, 10-18 ... second deposit was her zip code: 10012. greenwich village. where she lived." ||| 6 ||| 6
in the form of a phoenix, tess flies out of her room to join kevin, who is now permanently in the shape of such a magical bird. she tries to ask kevin what has happened to him since they last spoke, but her mind is overwhelmed by the purity and beauty of the phoenix’s nature, and she instantly loses interest in asking questions. the following night, she becomes worried about the restless behaviour of her pet rat algernon, and her animal-mind detects a telepathic summons being sent to all the rats in the city. algernon breaks out of his cage and escapes into the sewers, and as a rat tess follows him to an empty house filled with thousands of his kind. there, she discovers that the source of the mysterious call is a male switcher. the next day, tess investigates the house, and sees a red haired boy standing in the doorway of a house across the street. somehow sensing that he is the switcher, she resolves to speak to him when she gets the chance. upon reading a newspaper article, tess discovers that the phoenix has been captured in the phoenix park, and is now on display in dublin zoo. therefore, she sets off to visit the switcher and ask for help in breaking her friend out of confinement. tess finds the boy (martin) sleeping in the darkness of his room, and tells him that she knows he is a switcher. martin agrees to help her, but only on the condition that she return to his house that night so that he can demonstrate his skill as a switcher to her. when she does return, he takes her for a walk through the streets, and then demonstrates the truly awesome and horrible skill which he has learned by switching into a vampire. martin feeds on her blood, the shock of which stimulates tess’ survival instincts, and she switches into the only form in which she will be safe from martin: a vampire. once she is in this form, all of tess' revulsion toward the concept of vampirism vanishes. she bemoans her hunger for blood, but martin warns her not to kill her victim when she feeds, as doing so would arouse suspicion. after much hunting, the two come upon a young couple in a car, on whose blood they drink. for the next few days, tess behaves scornfully toward her parents, upsetting them greatly. at last when her mother mentions the phoenix, the memory of her time as one of those glorious, pure bird dispels the lingering aspects of the vampire personality, and she apologises for her behaviour. the family visit the zoo to see the bird, and there tess meets lizzie, who claims to be worried about something. the old woman informs her that the phoenix is a powerful force of good, and will change many lives, but according to the nature of the world, some dark force must have come into existence to balance out the presence of the phoenix. upon entering the building in which the bird is caged, tess is suddenly overcome by a feeling of joy and warmth, and realises that the bird is having this effect on everyone who sees it. outside, she and her parents enjoy a game of frisbee, all their arguments forgotten, not even becoming upset when tess accidentally loses the frisbee in the bushes. however, lizzie tells tess that the she has "work to do", and is wasting time. tess visits martin again, and he explains to her the gruesome circumstances of his father's death. she is horrified, but he seems not to care. he takes her into the crypt which he plans to make his home, and she realises that he has been using the rats to excavate this crypt. she tells him that she never wants to return to being a vampire, but martin claims that now he has bitten her, she will become one of the undead as soon as she dies. he tells her that his fifteenth birthday is the following day, and, because he intends to remain a vampire, he offers her the chance to join him willingly. she refuses, claiming that if she chooses to become an immortal phoenix, she will never succumb to death or vampirism. so as to destroy tess' confidence, martin sends the city's rats to kill kevin at the zoo, but the phoenix escapes with tess's help. he and martin confront each other in the park, and tess steps between them, where she is confronted with the choice between becoming like either of them. martin uses his hypnotic powers to coerce her, and in turn kevin uses his purifying powers to draw her toward him. tess alternates between allegiances and the struggle within her becomes so strong that it begins to damage her mind. as she tries desperately to choose her path, tess suddenly remembers some prior advice given by lizzie, and realises what she is doing wrong: she has been convinced that she must choose to be either a vampire or a phoenix, when in fact, the option of simply remaining human was never closed to her. tess chooses to retain her humanity, and this somehow transforms both martin and kevin back into their human forms. martin, his defences lowered, breaks down over the loss of his father, but when tess tries to comfort him, he realises he is vulnerable and runs off into the trees. tess follows, but slips on the frisbee which she lost earlier. tess enters martin's home in the form of a cat, and but doesn't see martin there. she checks on martin's mother, who tess has realised that martin had been feeding on for a while before she met him. however it seems that his mother is still alive, but exhausted. tess takes kevin back to her home, where they discuss the events of the past few days. kevin claims that because he and martin balanced each other out, martin's return to humanity meant that kevin too lost his supernatural form. their discussion is interrupted by the arrival of algernon, who informs them that martin has disappeared, and that his control over the rats of the city is broken. tess and kevin realise that martin has chosen to remain human, and decide to help him through his newly exposed grief. ||| 2 ||| 2

the novel continues the events that happened on from the highlands, and is set over the background of the fight against genetic slavery. the story begins after the truce between manticore and haven. captain zilwicki, his adopted daughter berry, princess ruth winton and the slave-turned-professor w.e.b. du havel are sent as queen elizabeth iii's (not the manticoran government's) official representatives to the funeral of a notorious solarian anti-slavery activist, which will take place in erewhon, a disgruntled member of the manticoran alliance. erewhon's location between manticore, haven and the solarian league makes it a place where agents from the different star nations can play the intelligence game. from the first moment, zilwicki, berry and ruth get entangled in a complex situation involving havenite agents, ambitious solarian navy officers, violent masadan mercenaries, the audubon ballroom and the powerful mesan corporation manpower incorporated. each faction has interests of its own, which collide with those of the others: the manticorans want to salvage their relation with erewhon (and upset the prime minister who allowed that relationship to sour). the havenites intend to show support for the anti-slavery cause and improve their own relationship with erewhon, with the unstated goal of breaking erewhon away from manticore. the erewhonese want someone&nbsp;— anyone&nbsp;— to help them deal with a mesan-owned planet which is a threat to their security. the solarian officers work to further the interests of a powerful political patron who believes that the league is on the verge of collapse and wants to be prepared for that event. the mesans want to stay out of the limelight and prevent all the other factions from attacking their major industry: slave trading, while the audubon ballroom simply wants to hit mesa anywhere they can. and even the masadan mercenaries employed by the mesans have their own agenda: to force manticore to free several of their imprisoned companions. the clash of interests comes to a head with an attempted kidnapping on berry zilwicki and ruth winton (who happens to be the sister of the leader of the masadan mercenaries) aboard the wages of sin, erewhon's main civilian space station. after manpower's involvement is discovered, a haphazard alliance between the manticorans, solarians, havenites and the ballroom is organized to launch an attack on the mesan-owned planet verdant vista, popularly known as "congo". the planet is taken from manpower's hands, and it is decided to transform it into an independent nation of its own for escaped slaves, so that the conflict against mesa may have a nation sponsoring it. the novel ends with berry zilwicki being crowned as berry i, queen of the new kingdom of torch. ||| 5 ||| 5

the novel is set in a world that is tidally locked. thus one side of the planet is always in light, and the other in darkness. science rules on the dayside, while magic holds sway in the night. powerful magical entities live on the night side of the planet, and for the most part the entities' magical powers emanate from distinct loci. jack of shadows (a.k.a. shadowjack), the main character, is unique among the magical beings in that he draws his power not from a physical location but from shadow itself. he is nearly incapacitated in complete light or complete darkness, but given access to even a small area of shadow, his potency is unmatched. jack's only friend, the creature morningstar, is punished by being trapped in stone at the edge of the night, to be released when dawn comes. his torso and head protrude from the rock, and he awaits the sun that will never rise. jack seeks "the key that was lost", kolwynia. the key itself and the consequences of its use parallel jack's progress in his own endeavors. ultimately, the key will be responsible for jack's salvation and his doom. fleeing the dark side, jack gets access to a computer and uses it to recover kolwynia. this makes him unbeatable, but not all-powerful. having made a mess of ruling with his new powers, he seeks the advice of morningstar, who advises him to destroy the machine at the heart of the world, which maintains the world's stability, and set it rotating. the novel ends with jack falling, perhaps to his death, but morningstar has been freed by the world's turning and rushes to rescue him. the fate of this ambiguous hero is left untold, with jack wondering, as he falls, if morningstar will reach him in time. ||| 2 ||| 2
