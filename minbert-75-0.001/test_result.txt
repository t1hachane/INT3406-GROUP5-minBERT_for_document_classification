the book begins two years after the events of the amulet of samarkand. nathaniel is apprenticed to the minister of security, jessica whitwell; and is working as an understudy to the minister of internal affairs, julius tallow. at the exceedingly young age of fourteen he is now a government official and a competent magician, but he no longer uses his original servant, bartimaeus. when the book starts, he is working on a case involving a shadowy group of rebelling commoners, known as the resistance. nathaniel knows only a few facts about the group including three of their members' names: kitty, fred, and stanley from his unpleasant encounter with them from book one. he tries to search for these three through written records but to no avail. he disguises several minor spirits as commoners and sends them out to find the resistance, but they too find no trace of the elusive group. kitty jones is on a mission for the resistance during a performance of the swans of araby, in a posh london theatre. kitty is having doubts about the point of her working for the resistance, and she begins to reminisce about her past and why she joined the resistance. she remembers her childhood, where she lived, somewhat poorly, next door to a czech family who owned a factory that printed books for the magicians. kitty often played cricket with her friend jakob hyrnek, son of the family that lived next door. one day, she accidentally hit a ball through the window of a magician's car as it passed. the magician came out and ordered his demon, a green monkey called nemaides, to perform the "black tumbler", a magical attack, on kitty and jakob. kitty is then woken up from her dream-like reverie by fred and stanley, the resistance members she is commanding, who chastise her for sleeping on the job, as the intermission of the play has started. they leave the theatre and go to the nearby carpet shop that sells posh carpets for magicians. they break in, steal some documents and magical items, and fred and stanley set fire to the shop with an inferno stick. kitty is worried about being caught and harming commoners, but stanley and fred disagree, ignoring her protests against the fire. they return to the theatre in time for the rest of the play. afterwards, several major shops in london are broken into by a mysterious enemy; everyone sent to investigate or on duty there is killed. from the foliot simpkin's point of view, he sees the attacker as a cloud of darkness. nathaniel switches to investigating the incident, discovering that six policemen and eight spirits including simpkin were also killed by the creature. most of the government suspects the resistance of being behind the attack but nathaniel thinks otherwise, citing the enormous scale of the attack. nathaniel and his master, ms. whitwell, are called to meet with the prime minister, rupert devereaux. he orders nathaniel to find the resistance and put a stop to their activities. nathaniel returns home, searches for a competent demon for surveillance, and finally decides to summon bartimaeus again, remembering various woefully unsuccessful demons he previously experimented with. he instructs bartimaeus to find the unknown attacker, identify it, and destroy it if he can. the book returns to kitty and her memories, continuing from where they left off earlier. kitty and jakob had both been sent to the hospital, and jakob was badly burnt. kitty escaped mostly unharmed -- although she did not know it at the time, this is due to her innate resistance to magic. kitty attempts to sue the magician but soon finds the justice system tilted in favor of magicians, and the magician gets away without charge, claiming kitty and jakob were trying to rob him. kitty is fined £100 for compensation to the magician for the damage to his car, and she also has to pay the magician's penalty (£500) for coming late, as per tradition which dictates that fines awarded to winners are passed on to losers of the cases. she thus has to pay £600. as kitty distraughtly leaves the court, a man asks her to meet up with him later, assuring her he will pay the full fine. she is rather suspicious of the stumbling little old man, but when she returns home and talks to her parents, she finds out the only way they can come up with the money is to sell the house. kitty quickly decides to meet the man, who turns out to be the leader of the resistance by the name of mr. pennyfeather. this eventually leads to her joining the resistance, and being placed in command of small groups of raiders, vandalising magicians' property. in the meantime, bartimaeus meets an old friend named queezle, and the two hunt for the mystery attacker, commanding a force composed of multiple djinn and foliots. eventually, as bartimaeus and queezle split up to patrol, the attacker runs across queezle and promptly kills her. hearing her scream, bartimaeus returns to assist her. he arrives too late, but is able to track the attacker to the british museum. he destroys the perceived black mist which conceals the attacker, and discovers that it is a golem, unharmable by djinn and other spirits. however, the golem attacks him as he flees, crushing him under an entire section of the museum. bartimaeus is rescued the following morning, and reveals the marauder's identity to whitwell, duvall, nathaniel, and tallow. whitwell then orders nathaniel to travel to prague, the origin of golem magic, and find out who controls the golem. kitty, while this occurs, meets with her friends in the resistance, including their informant, mr. hopkins, and they are told that they will raid gladstone's tomb. kitty meets with a magician, whose identity remains unknown and is referred to as 'the benefactor', and who gives them the materials to enter the tomb. that night, they enter gladstone's tomb. as they loot his coffin, stanley is killed by a powerful afrit named honorius, caged in gladstone's bones. the afrit then engages fred in a blade fight, which delays it long enough for the rest of the living resistance members to flee the tomb. as kitty urges her aged leader, mr. pennyfeather, up the steps, fred is killed by the afrit's antique sword, and the afrit quickly drags mr. pennyfeather off. kitty retreats and meets anne. as they escape the abbey, anne is killed by the afrit. at this point, as kitty flees, the afrit calls her back, imitating mr. pennyfeather. kitty hesitates, and honorius attempts to kill her; she is saved by her pendant of silver due to all demons' antipathy to the metal, and honorius' distraction at his rediscovering of the stars. she escapes, with only the staff of gladstone in exchange for her friends' deaths. nathaniel travels to prague to collaborate with a spy named harlequin to discover who the magician that created the golem spell is. during the second meeting, the czech police engage him and bartimaeus, and kill harlequin, after he gives nathaniel the magician's name: kavka. bartimaeus easily evades the police with nathaniel, and they arrive at the magician kavka's house. after 'breaking in', they convince kavka not to create a second golem. the dreaded mercenary from the previous book suddenly appears, and casually threatens the three of them. kavka then destroys the golem manuscript, and a combat scene follows, ending with bartimaeus blasting verroq, the mercenary, through a window with a hurricane, hurling him hundreds of feet away, but not killing him. nathaniel then returns to london, whereupon he is immediately whisked away with whitwell to an emergency meeting with the prime minister. nathaniel learns of the resistance's raiding of gladstone's tomb, and learns that honorius is terrorizing all of london. nathaniel sends bartimaeus to take care of honorius, and bartimaeus eventually drowns honorius in the thames, which should have killed him. bartimaeus returns to nathaniel, without much praise. nathaniel then hatches a plan to lure kitty jones, who possesses a historical and powerful artifact, gladstone's staff, into his clutches, by kidnapping her childhood friend jakob hyrnek. when kitty goes to rescue her friend, she is attacked by the night police. nathaniel, angry at the night police's intervention, sends bartimaeus to escape with kitty. he does so and takes her to the abandoned building where nathaniel and bartimaeus hid after the death of the underwoods. there, the two share an enlightening conversation about the endless cycle of conflict between humans and spirits. meanwhile, jakob hyrnek and nathaniel are apprehended by the night police and are taken before the council, who decide that if he can recover the staff, he will be set free. vigilance spheres follow them to the building, and kitty reveals where she hid the staff. she takes them there, and they recover the staff. however, when kitty and jakob attempt an escape, they are confronted by honorius, who is revealed to have climbed on a boat from an anchor chain. the ensuing chaos is interrupted when the golem intervenes. when the vigilance spheres flee, nathaniel tells kitty he will give her and hyrnek one day to leave the country. honorius is destroyed by the golem, and nathaniel attempts to destroy the clay beast with gladstone's staff. he fails, and is knocked unconscious by the magical backlash. kitty takes a desperate gamble, and yanks the animating parchment from the golem's mouth, thus saving nathaniel. jakob and kitty leave the scene, and when nathaniel comes to, he and bartimaeus trail the golem, which is returning to its master. henry duvall, the chief of police, is revealed to be the perpetrator, and is arrested. a few days later, duvall attempts escape, unintentionally killing himself. and much to nathaniel's displeasure, the staff is stored away. ||| 0 ||| 6
the entire plot really consists of alice traveling through the alphabet as she goes along meeting new friends, or rather, creatures and obstacles. in the end, she awakes to find that not more than a few seconds have gone by and that it was all just a dream. the story begins with alice busily talking to herself as she continuously tries to thread a needle through. to her dismay she continues to fail at this and she takes an extremely close look when she finds herself gliding through the air in an unknown world. she mentions how it was december at her previous whereabouts and how in needle's eye world it seemed to have a pleasant summer-ish feel to the place. when she finally falls to the ground she is cushioned by a haystack. when she emerges, she hears a distant call for "'elp". alice soon discovers that they were the small whimpers of a the country mouse, who believes that she is a comet. the country mouse hereafter befriends alice and informs her that she is not in a haystack, but an a-stack, or rather a messy pile of a's. she spots a few spelling bees, makes her way out of the haystack and continues in the direction of which she recalls seeing a beach from when she was flying. alice does not travel too far before she meets two cats, yet upon taking a closer look, she discovers that both are joined at the tail. alice questions them of their breed which they reply, as they finish each others sentences "we're siamese--". unknowingly, alice interrupts and discusses how siamese are much much different in appearance. the cats complete their statement and inform her that they were about to say siamese-twin cats until she so very rudely interrupted. alice apologizes as the cats begin to explain that one or the other is "as large as i am" or "as intelligent as i am" continuing in such a manner that their words are reduced to a mere "--'s i am--". after a short recovery from their long list, alice decides that she will identify the cats by naming one ping and one pang. for if she mistakes one for the other, surely it must end up being the latter. ping and pang recite the poem "the sands of dee"; pang forgets the last word of the poem, prompting a duel between them. the two cats instruct alice to count twenty paces, but she mentions that she could "...count up to a hundred if i really tried." thus, ping and pang begin to step away from each other, but before their duel begins, the sky darkens and rains down cats and dogs. when the peculiar shower of animals has stopped, ping and pang realize that they must attend the "vote." alice follows them to find out what the vote is about. the chapter opens with alice following the siamese cats towards the vote. suddenly, an elephant rears about near her—the country mouse making a short return to frighten it. alice decides not to frighten the mouse, but at least scare it off. hereafter, alice and the elephant have a conversation about being afraid of little things, the elephant retorting "i suppose you aren't afraid of insects, then?" after their short argument, the elephant states that they will be "late for the speeches." alice is then swept away by the elephant towards the "hide-and-seek park." here, she overhears the conversation of the grampus and the italian hairdresser (she knows he is italian because he speaks in italics). the emu begins its speech, but is constantly interrupted by the crocodile, belonging to the hairdresser, which is detained by an electric eel. finally, the emu finishes its speech and concludes with "and that's why i ask you all to vote for me!" in the end, after alice inquires what he stands for, he recites a poem about the letter "f". after this, the vote transforms into an auction, and with the final cry of, "going...going...gone!" everyone abruptly vanishes. luckily, not everyone had vanished and alice was left with both the grampus and the italian hairdresser. the grampus promptly inquires if her name is "boris". soon after, after a short while of discussion, the grampus realizes that he has indeed written down the wrong name within his autobiography. he explains to alice how forgetful he is, giving an example of how he sometimes "leaves home without an umbrella and returns with one". "this is why i have an autobiography," he said. "so that i don't forget!" both the grampus and alice miss the train that he wrote that they would need to get on in his autobiography. he then points out that they are to be attacked by a band of blood-thirsty brigands. after he realizes that the blood-thirsty brigands are not coming, he asks alice to tie him up. soon after she "rescues" him and they board the next train. as they ride the train, the grampus begins a discussion on the meaning of words. promptly after their discussion, the grampus notes that he does not want to be swept away by the hurricane mentioned in his book. alice, not wanting to "create" a hurricane, comes to the conclusion of simply writing the word 'not' into his book. the train suddenly turns into a study room and, out of curiosity, alice ventures out to discover what might lay upon the hill she had spotted in the distance. when starting to climb the hill, alice bumps into two people, or rather, 'stick figure people'. she realizes after a short conversation, that they are jack and jill from the nursery rhyme. although, they are a quite rude rendition of the two. she states that she recognized them from the rhyme which prompts jack to 'test' her. he says "if you know then surely you can do this!" jack then asks, or commands, alice to recite the poem forwards, backwards, and in french. although alice had no intention of it, she spat out the words as if it were a second nature to her. jack then states that due to the fact that she had 'caused' them to fall, she must now carry the eels or "l's" within their bucket to llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. alice sets off because she is too polite to say no in the first place. after a whiles walk, alice reaches a maze-like place with a sign that reads "llabyrinth". to alice's disappointment, she cannot get to the centre of the maze due to her childish logic of "if i take all lefts i'll be alright, but if i take all rights i'll be left! left within the maze!". alice comes across several confusing signs, many of which leading her back to the same place she was before. after a moment of despondency, she hears the country mouse; she attempts to follow it, but to no avail. she also attempts to throw one of the eels over the hedge as a signal, but fails, as it comes back like a boomerang. eventually, she drops off to sleep. when she awakes, she sees what she assumes is a human, running past her. she follows it, and in time, arrives in the centre of the maze. after finding a large congregation of animals stuck in the middle of the maze, they attempt to go through a race for the food that the welsh rabbit (the one who she had followed into the centre) possesses. in this chapter alice is volunteered for her to go into the rabbit hole which the cluster animals within the maze believe leads out. when going down the hole, she feels as if she's falling sideways, and describes it as an infinity sign. she contemplates things such as parallel lines meeting at infinity and how the sign looks like a tired eight. when she finally comes out, she is surprised to see where she is. ===ix: swan pie and green : yo i: the battle of letter ii: was it a dream?=== ||| 2 ||| 0
in the fictional clanton, mississippi, 10-year-old tonya hailey is viciously raped and beaten by two white racists&mdash;james louis "pete" willard and billy ray cobb. shortly thereafter, tonya is found and rushed to a hospital, while pete and billy ray are heard bragging in a roadside bar about what they did to tonya. tonya's distraught and enraged father, carl lee hailey, recalls a similar case from the year before, in which four white men raped a black girl in a nearby town and were acquitted. carl lee is determined not to allow that to happen in this case. consequently, while deputy dewayne powell looney is escorting pete and billy ray up a flight of stairs inside the courthouse, carl lee emerges from a nearby closet with an assault rifle and kills pete and billy ray and accidentally wounds looney, resulting in the amputation of his lower leg. (during his testimony in the trial looney forgives hailey, saying he has a daughter himself, and that if someone raped her, he would gladly do the same as carl lee.) carl lee is later arrested at his home by the highly respected, honorable and beloved black county sheriff ozzie walls (who must uphold the law but, as the father of two daughters of his own, privately supports what carl lee did and gives him special treatment while in jail) and charged with capital murder. despite the efforts of the naacp and his old military friend cat to persuade carl lee to retain their high-powered attorneys, carl lee elects to be represented by his friend, jake brigance. helping jake on the case are his two most loyal friends--his heavy-drinking former boss lucien wilbanks (who has since been disbarred for his involvement in a fight resulting from a union strike, but still consults and aides jake from the background), and sleazy divorce lawyer harry rex vonner. later, the crew is joined and greatly assisted by rabid aclu feminist and law student ellen roark, who has prior experience with death penalty cases and offers jake her services for free as a temporary clerk for the duration of the case. ellen appears to be interested in jake romantically, but jake resists her not-so-subtle overtures and is completely loyal to his wife. the prosecuting attorney is rufus buckley, a corrupt shark with no concern or respect for ethics and with sky high political ambitions, hoping to win the case so as to gain the publicity that a win would generate, in hopes of being elected to a higher public office (governor). to annoy buckley and call attention to this fact, jake often addresses the d.a. as "governor" in pre-trial conferences. presiding over the trial is white (but generally impartial) judge omar "ichabod" noose. it is claimed, however, that noose has been intimidated, both politically and criminally, a rumor given significant merit when, despite having no history of racist tendencies in his decisions, he refuses jake's perfectly reasonable request for a change of venue, further handicapping the defense, as the racial make-up of ford county virtually guarantees an all-white jury. at the same time, billy ray cobb's brother, freddy lee cobb, is seeking revenge for carl lee's killing of his brother. to this end, freddy enlists the help of the mississippi branch of the ku klux klan, which is led by mississippi grand dragon stump sisson. subsequently, a kkk member attempts to plant a bomb under jake's porch but is thwarted by the sheriff and a deputy after they receive a tip-off from a confidential informant (apparently inside the klan) going by the code name "mickey mouse." the informant is later exposed and murdered by the klan, and it is revealed that he was a former client of jake's and a frequent patron of the coffee shop where jake has long dined every morning and has become something of a folk-hero there. after the thwarted bombing, jake sends his wife and daughter out of town to his wife's parents' home until the trial is over and begins spending most nights either in his office or at lucien's house. later, jake's secretary ethel twitty and her frail husband bud are attacked by the kkk, killing bud. on the day the trial begins, there is a riot outside the court building between the kkk and the area's black residents, and stump is killed by a molotov cocktail. believing that the black people were at fault, freddy and the kkk increase their attacks. as a result, the national guard is called to clanton to keep the peace during the trial. undeterred, freddy continues his efforts to get revenge for billy ray's death. they shoot at jake one morning as he is being escorted into the courthouse, missing jake but seriously wounding one of the guardsmen assigned to protect jake. they continue to burn crosses throughout clanton, and jake's house is burnt down while jake is sleeping at lucien's. the case proceeds, and after reeling from the loss of his house and the revealing of a decades-old (and long-expunged) criminal conviction of the defense's psychiatrist whom jake had called to testify to carl lee's "temporary insanity" at the time of the killings, jake perseveres. he badly discredits the state's expert doctor in a powerful and snarky cross-examination in which he establishes that the doctor has never conceded to the insanity of any defendant in any criminal case in which he has been asked to testify, even when multiple other doctors have been in consensus otherwise. he traps the doctor with a revelation that several previous defendants found insane in their trials are currently under his care despite his having testified to their "sanity" in their respective trials. eventually the doctor loses any favor with the jury when jake frustrates him to such an extent that he blurts out "you just can't trust juries!" jake follows this up with his own captivating closing statement (ignoring lucien's advice to use a statement he had prepared for jake). after lengthy deliberations during which a massive pro-acquittal demonstration is held, the jury acquits carl lee by reason of temporary insanity. carl lee returns to his family, and the story ends with jake, lucien, and harry rex having a celebratory drink before jake is to hold a press conference and then leave town for a while to reunite with his wife and daughter. one major difference between the novel and the film adaptation is the origin of the assault rifle. in the book, carl lee and his brother get the rifle from a memphis mogul whom carl lee rescued in the vietnam war; in the movie, there is no explanation as to where carl lee got the rifle. another major difference between the book and the movie is the powerful closing argument. in the film, the visual and graphic story is told by jake brigance, along with imploring the jury to imagine that the victim was white. however, in the book, jake and harry rex discover through a post trial interview that a woman on the jury made that speech during jury deliberations. there is, in fact, a bit of a recurring theme throughout the book in that jake is about the only character who does not appear in any way to see the case through a racial lens. he repeatedly refuses to play the "race card" even when baited to do so by several reporters, is clearly much more politically conservative than an attorney arguing such a case at the time might have been expected to be, and is shown to be in sharp contrast with lucien on such matters, as well as with ellen, to whom he expresses his strong support for the death penalty (just not for carl lee) and his contempt for the aclu and, to a lesser extent, the naacp. in short, he seems to see the situation (and thus approaches the case) only from the perspective of the father of a daughter for whom he, too, would kill to protect. however, as a defense attorney, strictly speaking, this perspective is all he is required to defend. |||

kim and matt, with the help of tabor and imraith-nimphais, rescue the paraiko. ruana, their leader, chants kanior -- a ritual of forgiveness and lamentation for the dead that is tied to the paraiko's non-violent nature and the bloodcurse that protects them. so powerful is his performance that it invokes not only all the paraiko that have died through the centuries but even their enemies; both he and kim sense a finality in it, as is proven when the baelrath blazes and summons kim to change the paraiko's pacifist natures so they can fight against maugrim. due to the loss of their pacifism, however, the magical bloodcurse that had protected the paraiko for centuries was also lost forever. kim returns to ysanne's cottage where she meets darien and gives him the circlet of lisen. as she puts it on his head, the light of the gem goes out, and darien interprets this as a sign that he is evil. in despair he takes lökdal, the dagger that ysanne used to kill herself, and flees. kim calls after him to tell him where his mother is, hoping that jennifer will be able to comfort him. jennifer, waiting in lisen's tower for prydwen to return, listens to flidais' tale of the wild hunt and how its randomness, being outside the weaver's control, gifts the weaver's creatures with freedom of choice. that wildness also made maugrim possible; and because maugrim came from outside the tapestry there is no thread in it with his name on it, flidais explains, and so he cannot die. darien arrives at the tower, looking for love and acceptance. believing as she does that their only hope lies in leaving darien completely free, jennifer tells him simply that he must make his own choice and that she will not influence it, except to say that his father wanted her dead so that he would never be born. darien believes that his choice was made for him when the light of lisen's circlet went out and so departs to seek his father. prydwen returns in the midst of a terrible storm and jennifer immediately sends lancelot away, charging him to follow darien and protect him. lancelot battles an ancient stone creature of the wood, a demon named curdardh, only managing to defeat it with darien's help. in a moment of clarity darien realizes that his mother sent him away because she is not afraid of what he will do if he is left free to choose: she trusts him. lancelot finally loses sight of darien as he crosses daniloth in the form of a white owl. meanwhile, the dalrei, the lios alfar, and the men of brennin and cathal are gathering on the plain to face maugrim's army. jaelle's view of men as lesser beings has been challenged by kevin's unflinching sacrifice and she and paul/pwyll begin to tentatively shape a friendship. as they talk on the shore below lisen's tower, a ghostly ship appears to take all of them to andarien in time to meet aileron and the rest of the host of the light. loren, matt and kim return to the kingdom of the dwarves where matt competes against kaen and blöd to regain his rightful position as king of the dwarves. the crystal dragon of calor diman awakens but despite the blazing summons of the baelrath, kim refuses to bind it to help them against maugrim, realizing that she still has the power to choose and that there is a point where the ends do not justify the means. she uses the ring's power instead to take loren, matt and herself to the plain in time for matt to reclaim the dwarves and lead them to join the rest of the forces opposing maugrim's hordes. a giant urgach issues a challenge to single combat and arthur, hearing that the name of the plain was once camlann, recognizes that his time has come: "i never see the end." but while they debate, diarmuid seizes the moment and takes the challenge on himself. he fights brilliantly and kills the urgach but is mortally wounded, and dies in sharra's arms. the next morning the battle begins. among maugrim's army are avaia and her black brood of swans and, more terribly, a giant black dragon. kim, realizing that it was for this the baelrath had demanded the crystal dragon, is sick with self-reproach but imraith-nimphais and tabor fight valiantly and kill many of the swans. finally, realizing there is only one way to defeat the dragon, the unicorn shakes tabor from her back midair and plunges into the dragon's heart, killing both herself and the dragon. tabor is saved from his death plunge by magical intervention. despite this unexpected victory, the battle is not going well for the light as darien arrives in starkadh. he faces his father in a room at the top of a tower whose windows magically reflect the battle going on miles away. maugrim tries to batter his way into darien's mind, and when he fails guesses who darien is. realizing that a child of his getting binds him into the loom and thus makes him mortal, he gloats that now he will kill darien himself and thus restore his immortality. he takes lökdal from darien; darien, seeing the horror and death on the battlefield, at last makes his choice for the light. when he does so, lisen's circlet blazes up, temporarily blinding maugrim; in that moment darien steps forward onto the knife, and so maugrim kills without love in his heart and the curse of lökdal destroys him. the tide of battle turns and maugrim's army scatters, but galadan, who since lisen's death a thousand years ago has wanted nothing more than the annihilation of everything, blows owein's horn to summon the wild hunt. they arrive, but before they can begin to destroy everything in fionavar leila, far away in paras derval but still linked to finn, slams the double-headed axe down on the altar and demands in the name of the goddess that he come home. when finn tries to turn his horse, iselin throws him and he falls to his death. ruana of the paraiko arrives and, telling owien that since they have once again lost the child who leads them they must be returned to their slumber, binds them once again as connla did so long ago -- though he comforts them by saying that one day they will be free again. paul, recognizing that galadan's ability to hear the horn means that he is not altogether evil, leaves him free to go, and cernan takes him away to find healing. paul then calls the sea in to wash the plain clean;

the howard families derive from ira howard, who became rich in the california gold rush, but died young and childless. fearing death, he left his money for the prolongation of human life, and the trustees of his will carried out his wishes by financially encouraging those with long-lived grandparents to marry and have children. while the families (who, by the 22nd century, have a life expectancy of 150 years) have kept their existence secret, with the enlightened human society established under the covenant, they decide to reveal themselves. society refuses to believe the howard families simply 'chose their ancestors wisely', instead insisting they have developed a method to extend life, and the families are persecuted and interned. though the beleaguered administrator of the planet, slayton ford, is convinced the families are telling the truth, he is helpless to control an increasingly irrational public and their efforts to force the howard families to reveal their "secret" or face execution. the eldest member of the howard families, lazarus long, realizes this as well, and proposes to the administrator that he help the families hijack the colony starship new frontiers, so they can escape. in the process of escaping, they are driven too near the sun by military spacecraft. when they are a few minutes away from overheating, heinlein invokes a deus ex machina: it turns out that one member of the families, andrew jackson libby, (known as "slipstick" libby because he is a mathematical genius), has managed to invent a device that removes inertia from any mass to which it is attached. libby applies the device, and instantaneously, new frontiers is accelerated by light-pressure from the sun to nearly the speed of light. the families leave the solar system, with the deposed ford joining them at the last minute. the first planet they discover has humanoid inhabitants who seem friendly and advanced - however, they are merely domesticated animals belonging to the planet's true masters, indescribable beings of equally indescribable power. when humans prove incapable of similar domestication, they are expelled from the planet and sent to another world. the second planet is a lush environment with no predators and mild weather. its inhabitants are part of a group mind, with the mental ability to manipulate the environment on the genetic and molecular level. they have no independent personalities; anyone who joins the group mind ceases to exist as a unique individual. this becomes evident when mary sperling, second oldest of the families, who has always been fearful of death, joins the group mind in an attempt to become truly immortal. the families are further horrified when the group mind, in a mistaken effort to be helpful, genetically modifies the first baby born on the planet into a new, alien form. lazarus calls a meeting of the families. he states that humans are what they are because they are individuals, and that they have no place on this world. the families vote, and a majority of the families decide to go back to earth and claim their rights. libby, with the help of the group mind, builds a new faster than light drive that will take them home in months instead of years. the families return to the solar system seventy-five years after their original departure. to their surprise they find that on earth great longevity is commonplace. spurred on by the belief that there was a specific "technique" to the howards' longevity, earth's scientists developed a series of treatments that extended lifespans to several centuries. the families are now free to return, and are even welcomed due to their discovery of faster than light travel. thanks to humanity's increased lifespan, the solar system is overcrowded; faster than light travel will allow emigrants to ease the population explosion. libby and long decide to recruit other members of the families, and explore space with the new drive. ||| 5 ||| 5

in the flopsy bunnies, benjamin bunny and peter rabbit are adults, and benjamin has married his cousin flopsy. the couple are the parents of six children generally called the flopsy bunnies. benjamin and flopsy are "very improvident and cheerful" and have some difficulty feeding their many children. at times, they turn to peter rabbit (who has gone into business as a florist and keeps a nursery garden), but there are days when peter cannot spare cabbages.in the original frontispiece to the tale, a sign over the garden tended by peter and his mother reads, "peter rabbit and mother &mdash; florists &mdash; gardens neatly razed. borders devastated by the night or year". the illustration was eventually replaced (probably in the third printing) because of the difficulty in lettering the noticeboard in non-english editions (macdonald 1986, p. 40;linder 1976, plate 8). it is then that the flopsy bunnies cross the field to mr. mcgregor's rubbish heap of rotten vegetables. one day they find and feast on lettuces that have shot into flower, and, under their "soporific" influence, fall asleep in the rubbish heap. mr. mcgregor discovers them by surprise and places them in a sack and ties it shut then sets the sack aside while attending to another matter. benjamin and flopsy are unable to help their children, but a "resourceful" wood mouse called thomasina tittlemouse, gnaws a hole in the sack and the bunnies escape. their parents fill the sack with rotten vegetables, and the animals hide under a bush to observe mr. mcgregor's reaction. mcgregor does not notice the substitution, and carries the sack home. his wife claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them, but when she reaches into the sack and discovers the rotten vegetables, she accuses her husband of playing a trick on her. a vegetable marrow is thrown through the window, hitting the youngest of the eavesdropping bunnies. their parents decide it is time to go home. at christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. she makes herself a cloak and a hood, and a muff and mittens. scholar m. daphne kutzer points out that mr. mcgregor's role is larger in the flopsy bunnies than in the two previous rabbit books, but he inspires less fear in the flopsy bunnies than in peter rabbit because his role as fearsome antagonist is diminished when he becomes a comic foil in the book's final scenes. nonetheless, for young readers, he is still a frightening figure because he has captured not only vulnerable sleeping bunnies but bunnies whose parents have failed to adequately protect them. ||| 0 ||| 0

told in first-person narrative, the book portrays grogan and his family's life during the thirteen years that they lived with their dog marley, and the relationships and lessons from this period. marley, a yellow labrador retriever, is described as a high-strung, boisterous, and somewhat uncontrolled dog. he is strong, powerful, endlessly hungry, eager to be active, and often destructive of their property (but completely without malice). marley routinely fails to "get the idea" of what humans expect of him; at one point, mental illness is suggested as a plausible explanation for his behavior. his acts and behaviors are forgiven, however, since it is clear that he has a heart of gold and is merely living within his nature. during his escapades he makes a two-minute credited appearance in the movie the last home run (filmed in 1996 and released in 1998). the strong contrast between the problems and tensions caused by his neuroses and behavior, and the undying devotion, love and trust shown towards the human family as they themselves have children and grow up to accept him for what he is, and their grief when he finally dies from gastric dilatation volvulus (a stomach torsion condition) in old age, form the backdrop for the biographical material of the story. ||| 4 ||| 2

the city and the stars takes place a billion years in the future, in the city of diaspar. by this time, the earth is so old that the oceans have gone and humanity has all but left. as far as the people of diaspar know, they are the only city left on the planet. the city of diaspar is completely enclosed. nobody has come in or left the city for as long as anybody can remember, and everybody in diaspar has an instinctive insular conservatism. the story behind this fear of venturing outside the city tells of a race of ruthless invaders which beat humanity back from the stars to earth, and then made a deal that humanity could live - if they never left the planet. in diaspar, the entire city is run by the central computer. not only is the city repaired by machines, but the people themselves are created by the machines as well. the computer creates bodies for the people of diaspar to live in and stores their minds in its memory at the end of their lives. at any time, only a small number of these people are actually living in diaspar, the rest are retained in the computer's memory banks. all the currently existent people of diaspar have had past "lives" within diaspar except one person &mdash; alvin, the main character of this story. he is a 'unique', different from everybody else in diaspar, not only because he does not have any past lives to remember, but because instead of fearing the outside, he feels compelled to leave. alvin has just come to the age where he is considered grown up, and is putting all his energies into trying to find a way out. eventually, a character called khedron the jester helps alvin use the central computer to find a way out of the city of diaspar. this involves the discovery that in the remote past, diaspar was linked to other cities by an underground transport system. this system still exists although its terminal was covered over and sealed with only a secret entrance left. once out of diaspar, alvin finds that one other human habitation remains on earth. in contrast to technological diaspar, lys is a vast green oasis shielded by mountains from the worldwide desert. its people are not stored and recreated technologically, but naturally conceive, born, age, and die. they have rejected the hyper-advanced technology of diaspar in favor of an almost agrarian existence, with machines used only for labor-saving purposes. the people of lys have instead worked to perfect the arts of the mind; they are telepaths, capable of communicating with each other over great distances and without words. alvin continues his quest until he finds out the truth of why the people of diaspar are so frightened of the external universe and why lys is so scared of space travel and mechanical things. in lys he goes on a trip with a young man named hilvar who becomes his friend, and they see a signal light, which they decide to investigate. it leads them to shalmirane, the remains of the fortress where the invaders were fought off with unimaginable weapons, and there they encounter an extraterrestrial creature with a strange robot. the creature is the last survivor of a religious cult dating back to the days of the galactic empire. the robot was the companion of the founder, the "master", who came with his followers to earth at the end of his life. alvin and hilvar are unable to understand the content of the religion except that it refers to "great ones" who have left, but will someday return. alvin persuades the creature to lend him the robot, arguing that the master would want it to see how things were developing in the world. the master had, however, forbidden the robot to give out any information at all, so alvin does not learn anything. the robot enables alvin to escape the attempts of the people of lys to purge his mind and send him back—the previous 14 uniques had stayed. alvin had originally been told he would be free to choose whether to stay or return, but because the people of lys had failed to prevent news of his departure spreading in diaspar in time, this option was no longer available. back in diaspar he seeks the help of the central computer, which overcomes the master's block on the robot by producing an illusion of an apocalyptic return of the great ones. alvin now learns that the master's ship is still functional, buried outside diaspar. he manages to retrieve it, fetches hilvar from lys, and travels into deep space. they encounter vanamonde, a being of pure intellect, with whom hilvar, being telepathic like other lys people, can communicate and bring him back to earth. from him the truth of history finally emerges. the fearsome invaders, it turns out, were a myth: shalmirane was actually used to destroy the moon when this became necessary to prevent it from colliding with the earth. instead, the people of diaspar and lys are the descendants of those humans who deliberately turned away from the universe in rejection of history's greatest scientific project: the creation of a disembodied intellect. the first attempt had created a powerful but insane being, the mad mind. the mad mind had devastated the galaxy and its civilizations before being imprisoned in a "strange artificial star" called the black sun. vanamonde is the second, successful experiment of the ancient empire: a being of pure intellect, immensely old, immensely powerful, able to move instantly to any point in space — but entirely childlike and unsophisticated. vanamonde's ultimate destiny, hilvar realizes, is to battle the mad mind, when it escapes its prison at the end of time. after this, most of the galactic empire had left our galaxy, leaving only a scattered few. this departure from the galaxy, leaving it to vanamonde, was because contact had been made with something "very strange and very great" which called them urgently. alvin's discoveries reunite diaspar with lys. he then sends the ship, under the command of the robot, to search for the long-lost people of the empire. he does not wish to search himself - even if there are human remnants in the galaxy, they are probably decadent - and he has work to do on earth. even the environment, he hopes, can be revived. ||| 5 ||| 5

part one follows several different people over the same period of several days. several of the characters appear in the two previous books, including armand, daniel (the "boy reporter" of interview with the vampire), marius, louis, gabrielle and santino. each of the six chapters in part one tells a different story about a different person or group of people. two things unify these chapters: a series of dreams about red-haired twin sisters, and the fact that a powerful being is killing vampires around the world by means of spontaneous combustion. pandora and santino rescue marius, having answered his telepathic call for help. marius informs his rescuers that akasha has been awakened by lestat, or rather his rock music, for he has joined a rock band of mortals whose names are alex, larry and tough cookie. having been awakened by lestat's rebellious music, akasha destroys her husband enkil and plots to rule the world. akasha is also revealed as the source of the attacks on other vampires. part two takes place at lestat's concert. jesse, a member of the secret talamasca and relative of maharet, is mortally injured while attending the concert, and is taken to maharet's sonoma compound where she is made into a vampire. the vampires from part one later congregate in the sonoma compound. the only vampires not present are akasha and lestat. akasha has abducted lestat and takes him as an unwilling consort to various locations in the world, inciting women to rise up and kill the men who have oppressed them. part three takes place at maharet's home in a sonoma forest. there maharet tells the story of akasha and the red-haired twins (who are, in fact, maharet and her sister, mekare) to pandora, jesse, marius, santino, eric, armand, daniel, louis and gabrielle. also present are mael and khayman, who already know the story. in part four, akasha confronts the gathered vampires at maharet's compound. there she explains her plans and offers the vampires a chance to be her "angels" in her new world order. akasha plans to kill 90 percent of the world's human men, and to establish a new eden in which women will worship akasha as a goddess. if the assembled vampires refuse to follow her, she will destroy them. the vampires refuse, but before akasha can destroy them, mekare enters. mekare kills akasha by severing her head. mekare then consumes akasha's brain and heart, thereby saving the lives of the remaining vampires and becoming the new queen of the damned. in part five, the vampires leave maharet's compound and assemble at armand's resort, the night island, (according to anne rice, inspired by fire island) in florida to recover. they eventually go their separate ways (as told in the tale of the body thief). lestat takes louis to see david talbot in london. after their brief visit with talbot they depart into the night, an incensed louis and his angry words filling lestat with glee. the queen of the damned, deals with the origins of vampires themselves. the mother of all vampires, akasha, begins as a pre-egyptian queen, in a land called kemet (which will become egypt), many thousands of years ago. during this time two powerful witches (maharet and mekare) live in the mountains of an unnamed region. the witches are able to communicate with invisible spirits and gain simple favors from them. during this period there is a bloodthirsty, invisible spirit known as amel who continually asks the two witches if they need his assistance, although they prudently decline the offer. the witches' village is destroyed and they are incarcerated by the king and queen, who desire their knowledge. when the witches offend akasha, the queen condemns the twins. enkil then orders his chief steward (who is khayman as a mortal man) to rape the twins in his stead, which would prove their lack of power, before the eyes of the court. afterward the witches are cast out into the desert. while making her way back home with a pregnant maharet, mekare curses the king and queen secretly with the bloodthirsty spirit. eventually this spirit inflicts such torment on akasha and enkil that they again demand advice and help from the two witches. conspirators, unhappy with the young king's policies, assassinate the royal couple in khayman's house whilst they were attempting to exorcise amel, who had been tormenting khayman. while the king and queen lie dying, the evil spirit sees its chance to ensnare the soul of the dying queen and pulls it back into her body. the spirit combines itself with the flesh and blood of the queen, transforming her into a vampire. akasha allows the king to drink her blood, which saves his life. they then order khayman to find the witches and bring them back to egypt so that they could use their knowledge of spirits to help them, as they feel guilty because of their thirst for blood. however, when the witches admit that they cannot help the monarchs, akasha orders the mutilation of the witches: maharet loses her eyes and mekare her tongue. afterward, khayman, who had been turned into a vampire by akasha, comes to the witches' cell and turns them too. the three flee together, but are caught by akasha's soldiers. khayman escapes, but maharet and mekare are further punished. the witches are put into two separate coffins which are then set afloat on two separate bodies of water. they are only reunited near the end of the novel queen of the damned. in mekare's absence, maharet returns to watch over her daughter and her descendants. maharet's descendants become what she calls the great family. a maternal line, the great family includes every culture, religion, ethnicity, and race. the great family represents all humanity and shows the vampires what akasha would destroy with the creation of her new world order. as the source of all vampires, akasha is connected to all vampires by the blood and spirit they collectively share. in an experiment by the first keeper, akasha and enkil are exposed to sunlight when they are several thousand years old. this merely darkens their skin. however, the result on all other vampires is extreme, and many of the weakest vampires die, thus confirming the legend that anything that harms akasha will also directly affect all of her progeny. ||| 2 ||| 2
the doom brigade chronicles the former first dragonarmy engineering regiment’s quest to recover the first female draconians on krynn after the war of the lance. the brigade has left the dragonarmies in search for a new life, and led by commander kang, a bozak, and subcommander slith, they have set up a small town in the valleys below the kharolis mountains. unfortunately, their neighbors are hill dwarves in the town of celebundin, who aren't very receptive to the idea of draconian neighbours. for the last twenty five years, raids have occurred every couple of weeks, whether the draconians are short on dwarf spirits, or the dwarves are short on other supplies. however, they have grown to respect each other, and so have made a silent pact to only use blunt weapons, so that the victim is only knocked out or stunned. while en route to raiding the dwarves one day, one of kang’s scouts reports a pair of red dragons on the horizon. kang, curious, leads his troops to a pass on the outskirts of the plains of dust, where he meets talon leader huzzud. huzzud, a knight of the lily, is a talon leader for the fifth dragonarmy, which is led by general ariakan. she proposes that kang and his regiment join their army to retake ansalon, but kang decides to inspect their camp first. after inspecting the armies' camp and speaking to their commander, kang realizes that this force doesn't consist of untamed goblins like in the previous war, but a well-trained and deadly force of knights. he realizes that since draconians can't breed, it would be better to die fighting then to just slowly fade away. on that note, he signs himself and his regiment up. soon after, they are called to assist the dragonarmy in the conquering of qualinost. once they arrive, they are ordered to report for latrine duty. disgusted, kang’s regiment revolts, and returns to their town. on their return, however, they find their village in flames. they slaughter any dwarves that they can find in their village, and nail their bodies to posts. meanwhile, four dwarves who regularly make trips to search for riches, pestle, mortar, auger and selquist discover a map leading to the lost treasures of neraka while raiding thorbardin through a secret passage. plotting revenge, kang orders a small group of five draconians, including himself and slith, to enter the dwarven town to find out who burned down their village. slith and the other three shape shift into dwarven guards, while kang turns invisible. however, when the dwarves discover one of the draconians, the five beat a hasty retreat. slith managed to steal a book with the map secreted within it from selquist before they retreated; however, selquist now pursues the draconians. after he catches kang, he drives a knife into kang's leg, temporarily crippling him. the dwarf and the draconians squabble over the book, ending up with the dwarf regaining the book, but the draconians keeping the cover, which has the map hidden inside it. the draconians retreat into their camp, unbeknownst to the fact they have the map to the nerakan treasures. a few days later, selquist appears at the draconian camp, begging kang to remove a curse which he believes has been put on him. kang does so after being told that the map leads to unhatched draconian females. knowing that "rescuing" the females is the only way to continue their own race, kang and twenty-four other draconians set out to retrieve the eggs. unfortunately, the four dwarves decide to destroy the eggs and steal the treasure. joined by a retinue from moorthane, the dwarven war chief, and twenty guards, the dwarves set out. for many days and nights, kang’s regiment follow the dwarves. just before entering thorbardin, however, kang is visited by huzzud, who warns him that the dark queen wishes him to complete some great task before he gains the eggs. unable to be told more, kang leaves huzzud. after traveling for a long while in the tunnels of thorbardin, the dwarves stumble upon a grell. grells are large, green octopus-like creatures that float above the ground who live underground. unfortunately, this one has a wand of the dark queen. after a long battle, the draconians join in, slaying the grell and taking the wand. later, just before reaching their goal, they stumble on a lair of rock and molten lava. out of the lava rises a massive fire dragon, made out of chaos, which if unstopped, would destroy all of krynn. kang realizes that this was the grand test that he had been assigned, and orders his regiment back. kang almost dies battling the dragon, until he uses the wand to create water to cool himself and solidify the creature. he then creates mud to bury it, gaining himself and his regiment precious time; unfortunately, there's actually an entire nest. while the draconians (who join kang) are battling the dragons, the dwarves move into the treasure room. after losing a good number of men to the dragons, kang realizes the only way to defeat them. he orders his regiment back, and commands the wand to cause the stalagmites from the roof to fall into the nest. the wand obeys, and kang rushes for the exit. he barely makes it, but weak and injured, he falls unconscious. after waking, he discovers he’s trapped, until he hears slith’s voice through the rocks. heartened, the draconians dig through the rocks to rescue kang. it is then they realize that they are only 100 odd meters away from the eggs. after realizing this, they rush forward, only to find the dwarves about to kill the young. after negotiating, they reach an agreement. kang’s regiment shows the dwarves the way out of thorbardin and the draconians keep the young and move out of the valley. the novel ends with selquist, too injured carry his treasure, bargaining with gloth ( a draconian subcommander ), over a map to an abandoned city just south of nordmaar. ||| 5 ||| 2
occasional chapters of dragonsblood are set soon after the end of the first pass of the red star, nearly 450 years before most of the action. there (or then) the elderly wind blossom, a geneticist and daughter of the legendary kitti ping, is bemoaning the gradual loss of manufactured items and the technology to create them. she and her ex-protégé tieran are startled by two fire-lizards who literally fall from the sky. one, a gold, dies upon arrival and it is obvious that both are sick. they nurse the other one, a brown, back to health, using the last of the antibiotics. not knowing if the fire-lizard’s sickness is contagious, they quarantine it until it recovers. tieran adopts the fire lizard and names him grenn&nbsp;– the name found on the harness he was wearing. further investigation of the decorations on grenn’s harness leads to the incredible conclusion that he is from the future. since fire-lizards provided the genetic basis that kitti ping used to build the thread-fighting dragons (and wind blossom used to build the watch-whers), they speculate that this future affliction of fire-lizards might be fatal to dragons, and that is confirmed when a dead gold dragonet appears&nbsp;– one obviously sickened by the same future disease. the dragon’s body is destroyed, but tieran recovers a decorated piece of metal from its harness. in order to save the dragons of the future, wind blossom and tieran devise a plan to educate someone from the future in genetics and the scientific knowledge to isolate the disease and devise a cure. they create hidden rooms in benden weyr and fill them with instructions and equipment to educate that future person. tieran believes that both the fire-lizard and dragon came from the same woman in the future, since both had similar harness decorations and only women impress gold dragons. he further believes that she has some connection with himself and wind blossom&nbsp;– a connection that both dragon and fire lizards followed. he leaves a small souvenir for her in the hidden rooms. about 400 years later, at the beginning of the 3rd pass of the red star, a talented young sketch artist and amateur healer lorana is hitching a ride across the ocean to the newly built half-circle seahold. in a desperate attempt to save her two fire-lizards grenn and garth during a storm at sea, she orders them to leave her and believes they are dead. she is found washed up on the beach by dragonriders from benden weyr and recovers just in time to impress arith, a gold dragon. meanwhile, dragons and fire-lizards are falling sick to a disease with a 100% mortality rate. fire-lizards are banned from the weyrs and many die due to the disease. lorana, who can hear and speak with any dragon, thus sharing in the death of each dragon, frantically scours records in hopes of finding some sort of clue or help towards fighting the disease. she unearths records of hidden rooms in the weyr and gets them open. the recorded voice of wind blossom invites her and her companions to enter and learn what they need to find a cure. lorana’s dragon arith goes between and dies when a combination of the disease and an injection of watch-wher genetic material wreak havoc with her system. despite the tragedy of losing arith and the added burden of over a thousand dragon deaths, lorana successfully learns how to use such items as a microscope and a genetic sampler to find the disease and create a cure. she can only make a single dose which she injects into the pregnant gold minith, in hopes that the cure will be passed onto future dragon generations. minith, her irritable rider tullea and several others are sent between times to the past to give them time to recover. they return in triumph, with enough cure to save the rest of the dragons. an older and kinder tullea gives lorana an ancient locket she had swiped from the first of the hidden rooms. in it are a piece of arith’s harness and pictures of wind blossom, tieran and her fire-lizard grenn. ||| 5 ||| 2
the novel is set in world war i and opens with a framing story in which a manuscript relating the main story is recovered from a thermos off the coast of greenland. it purports to be the narrative of bowen j. tyler, an american passenger with his airedale terrier nobs on a ship sunk in the english channel by a german u-boat, , in 1916. he is rescued by a british tugboat with another survivor, lys la rue. the tug is also sunk, but its crew manages to capture the submarine when it surfaces. unfortunately, all other british craft continue to regard the sub as an enemy, and they are unable to bring it to port. sabotage to the navigation equipment sends the u-33 astray into the south atlantic. the imprisoned german crew retakes the sub and begins a raiding cruise, only to be overcome again by the british. a saboteur continues to guide the sub off course, and by the time he is found out it is in antarctic waters. the u-33 is now low on fuel, with its provisions poisoned by the saboteur benson. a large island ringed by cliffs is encountered, and identified as caprona, a land mass first reported by the (fictitious) italian explorer caproni in 1721 whose location was subsequently lost. a freshwater current guides the sub to a stream issuing from a subterranean passage, which is entered on the hope of replenishing the water supply. the u-boat surfaces into a tropical river teeming with primitive creatures extinct elsewhere; attacked, it submerges again and travels upstream in search of a safe harbor. it enters a thermal inland sea, essentially a huge crater lake, whose heat sustains caprona’s tropical climate. as the sub travels north along the island’s waterways the climate moderates and wildlife undergoes an apparent evolutionary progression. on the shore of the lake the crew builds a palisaded base, dubbed fort dinosaur for the area’s prehistoric fauna. the british and germans agree to work together under tyler, with bradley, the mate from the tug, as second in command and von schoenvorts, the original sub commander, in control of the germans. the castaways are attacked by a horde of beast men and take prisoner ahm, a neanderthal. they learn that the native name for the island is caspak. oil is discovered, which they hope to refine into fuel for the u-33. as they set up operations, bradley undertakes various explorations. during his absence lys disappears and the germans mutiny again, absconding with the submarine. tyler leaves the other survivors to seek and rescue lys. a series of adventures ensues among various bands of near-human primitives, each representing a different stage of human advancement, as represented by their weaponry. tyler rescues lys from a group of sto-lu (hatchet men), and later aids the escape of a woman of the band-lu (spearmen) to the kro-lu (bowmen). lys is lost again, and chance discoveries of the graves of two men associated with bradley’s expedition leaves tyler in despair of that party’s fate. unable to find his way back to fort dinosaur, he retreats to the barrier cliffs ringing caspak in a vain hope of attracting rescue from some passing ship. improbably reunited with lys, he sets up house with her, completes the account of his adventures which he has been writing, and casts it out to sea in his thermos. ||| 0 ||| 5

the book reveals that amanda kirby (eric's mother) and her new boyfriend ben hildebrand, had planned to travel to costa rica and take eric to isla sorna, the legendary site b of jurassic park. unfortunately, ben and eric have a parasailing accident and end up stranded on the island. ben dies after being injured in the crash, and eric is forced to leave when dinosaurs start roaming the area. from that moment on he has to survive by himself, matching wits with the fearsome predators (and some aggressive herbivores) in the island. after being injured by an ankylosaurus and driven off by a pack of compys, eric finds ingen's old buildings, when he decides to hide. unfortunately, this place is also being used by raptors as headquarters, and he is almost killed. later, he decides to find a communications bunker to ask for help. however, he ends up trapped in the middle of a furious battle between a large pack of raptors and a herd of iguanodons, and eventually he sacrifices his last chance to get help, instead saving a young iguanodon he had befriended before. after that, he returns to the jungle knowing that perhaps he will spend the rest of his life there. the book reveals some interesting things about ingen, jurassic park and its dinosaurs, and also about the main character, for example: * it is revealed that original wildlife on the island has survived despite the introduction of dinosaurs, including sloths, quetzals and snakes. * it seems that the dinosaur population is not as balanced as previously thought, and raptors are actually keeping herds of herbivores prisoners in a valley, so that they can hunt them more easily. * it is revealed how eric got the tyrannosaurus pee and also the raptor claw he shows to alan grant in the movie. * iguanodons are introduced in this book; eric befriends one of them, and names him "iggy". * a pteranodon is described as flying around the island, although in the movie, all pteranodons were captive. the pteranodon is eventually caught by a t-rex. * it is revealed that ben most likely died due to internal injury, not eaten. * the dinosaurs that appear in survivor are triceratops, ankylosaurus, velociraptor, compsognathus, tyrannosaurus, diplodocus, pteranodon and iguanodon. the spinosaurus, although present in the jurassic park iii movie, did not appear in the book, even though eric stated in the film that the tyrannosaurus pee had attracted "a huge dinosaur with a sail on its back". * scott ciencin suggests that the reason for the deinonychus-like appearance on velociraptors, and the teeth on pteranodon are most likely the result of ingen's scientists messing up with dinosaur dna during the creation of jurassic park. ||| 2 ||| 5

the novel primarily focuses on the life story of randall peterson "pete" armstrong, a child prodigy with total recall memory, whose entire life's outlook has been defined the tragic murder of his younger brother, leonard, by an ex-convict who was believed to be capable of committing violent crimes again, but could not be imprisoned any longer under the current law structure. pete is committed to making a difference for humanity that will atone for his brother's death and help millions of others, too. in his first year at harvard at the age 13, pete is recruited to enroll in a small, but exclusive, class of the brightest and most agile students on campus. in that class, he meets people and establishes friendships that will further his identity. it is there that the idea of a `truth machine' is conceived and pete realizes that its existence is possible and that he could do it. the `truth machine' would be a mechanism that would be 100% accurate in determining if a person was lying or telling the truth. it could help eliminate crime and dishonesty in general. as long as it is employed universally (and not just by government officials), the `truth machine' could revolutionize humanity and take it to that next evolutionary step which would help it avert its coming self-destruction. ||| 5 ||| 5

the book picks up where the previous one left off. a spackle army marches on new prentisstown from one direction, and the forces of the answer from the other direction. mayor prentiss has been freed by todd to help defend the city, whilst viola is with the answer and the scout ship, in hopes of acquiring additional aid. the mayor assembles his army and orders attacks on the spackle army at the waterfall near the city. the spackle, however, while outgunned, are thousands in number, and their weaponry has evolved since the first war thirteen years prior. while keeping the bows and arrows, a new weapon that unleashes white 'sticky' fire is mounted on the back of their bullock -like creatures, labelled ‘battlemores’ by the settlers. this, along with another weapon - white sticks that shoot a mixture of organic chemicals - easily beat back the mayor's first wave. todd is nearly obliterated by the fire weapon, but uses his noise in the same way he used it against the mayor to incapacitate the rider of the battlemore. a second wave of soldiers, this time utilising artillery to cover them, are able to send the spackle back in retreat. meanwhile, viola finds mistress coyle with the scout ship, which has landed at the base of the demolished communications tower. two friends from the settler convoy, simone and bradley have been sent to look for viola, and are shocked at the state she, and the settlement, is in. mistress coyle, at first surprised that viola is alive, quickly recovers, and tries to explain her actions. but viola silences her and warns simone and bradley not to trust the healer. then, concerned with todd’s safety, viola asks bradley to launch a survey probe to scope out the scene. after seeing the war and spackle weaponry, and faced with the risk of losing todd, viola nearly launches one of the scout ship's point-to-point missiles at the battle. however, the mayor’s secret artillery is fired first. bradley and simone accept viola's decision that nobody is trustworthy, save for todd, and send the probe to observe the spackle encampment, revealing the enormous numbers they have. the narrative then switches to a spackle in the midst of the spackles’ camp. the spackle is 1017, called the return, and exists as a separate entity to the land, the spackles. he is the only surviving burden, and seeks revenge on the clearing for killing his ‘one’. his viewpoint ends with bradley's probe being shot down. the next day, spackle dam off the river far down, blocking the water supply, and attack the mayor's camp with a bow-launched burning boomerang that is capable of returning after hitting several targets and then being re-launched in a matter of seconds. coyle attempts to manipulate viola to launch a missile to save ‘her boy’, but bradley is heavily against it. todd, being watched by a new probe, becomes a stationary target when his horse, angharrad, refuses to move and he refuses to leave her (he cannot do the same thing he did to manchee). when viola thinks she sees todd getting hit by one boomerang, though it was actually the mayor's horse, she launches the missile, which causes a catastrophic explosion. this kills all the spackle archers and blocks the way up and down the hillside, separating the two armies. the mayor then sends the thought ‘i am the circle and the circle is me’ into todd, softly, though todd objects and threatens to hurt him. then he notices that this quietens his noise, and pushes away the memories of war, and so he finds himself repeating it for comfort and power. viola arrives at the town square, shaken that she caused a war for todd. todd tells her that he would have done the same, but she finds little comfort. she then notices that todd’s noise is quieter, and he sees that she is ill, but the two do not elaborate on either conditions. the narrative switches again to the return, who is arguing with the sky, the leader of the spackle, and demands more action and attacks. the sky refuses to do anything that will not be for the good of the land, but asks the return to trust him, and takes his to the pathway’s end. he reveals ‘the source’, a human captured before the war began. the sky offers the source to the return if the two armies reach peace. the return is unsure why such a person would be considered a reward until he recognises the source as ben, todd's adoptive father. meanwhile, refugees begin to pour in from the outskirts of new prentisstown - most of the men joining the mayor's forces in the town square, while most of the women joining coyle's forces at the landing site. the spackle begin attacking the town at random, destroying various targets and killing any scout parties the mayor sends. the white stick weapons are realised to be some sort of ballistic weapon that shoot acid, which vaporizes on leaving the barrel, but keeps cohesion until it hits a target. eventually, the water store is attacked, and nearly all of the remaining water is lost. during this time, the mayor loses control over ordering soldiers with his noise, and todd hits him and takes over. the mayor praises him for having such ability, but todd is preoccupied with the discovery of james’ body (a soldier who feeds the horses, drowned in the water tank flood). he would not have been killed if todd had not controlled him to go get extra water for angharrd, and this causes todd to regret having controlled him for his own desires. now without water, and the answer without food, the two parties are forced into a peace talk at the destroyed house of healing. the mayor and todd meet coyle, simone, bradley and lee, and todd and viola quickly disclose the fact that they have brought additional soldiers who are in hiding. however, todd doesn’t reveal why his noise is becoming harder to hear, and viola refuses to acknowledge that the infection from her arm band is starting to seriously affect her. after negotiations, a peace is reached and a transfer of food is made from new prentisstown to coyle's camp. now that the two groups are working together, the mayor lures spackle out to fight them, and the answer provides bombs to destroy the attacking spackle. bradley, nicknamed ‘the humanitarian’, angrily convinces todd and viola to stop this. a spackle is captured by the mayor, and then sent back to the encampment with two messages. the mayor sends one of absolute silence, and todd tells them that they want peace. he hears the spackle call him ‘the knife’ before running away. angry that the mayor undermined her, mistress coyle sends a bomb into the spackle stronghold. the spackle respond by sending the same spackle that was captured, telling them to send two people to meet the sky on the hill tomorrow morning. viola and bradley, who has caught the noise germ and will thus appear more trustworthy, are sent to talk. the sky greets them, but one individual - 1017, the survivor of the mayor's genocide, and the spackle who had sworn vengeance on todd when he was saved - recognizes viola as todd's ‘one’, and attempts to murder her. however, he stops when he sees the id band that had been banned onto her wrist, and in his surprise is taken away by the land. hesitantly, the peace talks resume. that night, however, the spackle launch a surprise attack on the mayor and todd. but the mayor, who had read the sky’s noise through the messenger, knew of this plan beforehand and had already set up his artillery and soldiers. after killing the attacking spackle, the mayor grabs todd’s comm and tells the sky that he can read him and that he should forfeit. the sky, shocked, agrees. the return, meanwhile, has returned to the pathway’s end to kill ben as peace has now been reached. the sky meets him there, and watches as the return fails to murder ben, unable to kill just like todd. he resents this, but the sky tells him he will need this knowledge when he becomes the sky, and then wakes up ben, ignoring the return’s confusion at this statement. when ben wakes, he can speak in the language of the land. the next day, peace is reached, though negotiations are scheduled to continue. the mayor strategically announces that they have beaten the spackle to the hilltop campers, and that a cure for the id band infection has been found. mistress coyle is outraged and convinced that the mayor planned this, and takes to testing the cure, warning that audience that the mayor is up to something. her accusations are met with booing and anger, and she recedes in bitter anger. soon, testing reveals that the cure uses an aggressive antibiotic mixed with an aloe the mayor claims he found in spackle weaponry, which allows the medicine to disperse ten to fifteen times faster. viola asks todd to decide if she should take the cure. at the town square, the mayor teaches todd how to read by giving his skill of reading through noise. after reading his mother’s diary, todd asks the mayor if the cure is real, and the mayor simply says it will. convinced, todd brings the bandages to viola the next morning to treat her infection. a little later, mistress coyle delivers a speech on her intentions to resign and hand over leadership to the mayor fully. however, it quickly turns out to be a plot to kill the mayor using a bomb strapped to her own person. todd, in an attempt to save simone who is in front of mistress coyle, inadvertently saves the mayor instead, foiling her plan and revealing that he can control people with his noise (as he ordered wilf to jump from his position near mistress coyle). the mayor thanks todd endlessly but todd is horrified that he has saved the mayor subconsciously and not simone, as proven by the replay on nearby probes. viola is similarly horrified, unsure of who todd has become. she tells him that she hates his silence, and they fight, todd convinced that the mayor has changed and viola accusing him of turning into the mayor. she then tells him that she cannot trust him anymore; that he isn’t him anymore, causing his noise to flare up in anger, shock and hurt. the mayor interrupts before more can be said, intent on delivering another speech to show the citizens that he is okay. as the mayor starts the speech, and asks todd to be his son, ben and the return arrive. todd, overwhelmed by happiness, launches himself at ben and leaves the mayor on stage, ordering people to get out of his way as he runs. the two embrace, and the mayor is left feeling betrayed and unwanted. now that ben can speak the spackle’s language, he prefers using his noise to communicate, and, consequently, todd’s noise opens up around ben as they talk. after this, todd asks viola to leave new prentisstown with him when the war is over, and declares that he doesn’t care about what will happen to everyone without his supervision. his noise is audible once more, and he openly thinks about how beautiful viola is and how he wants to hold her. he hastily apologises, but viola kisses him, and thinks that it feels like ‘finally’. the present party splits to settle a peace immediately, leaving todd and the mayor alone. angered that todd no longer cares about him, and wishes to leave him the moment peace is established, the mayor shoots ivan and steals the scout ship, kidnapping todd in the process. learning how to operate the scout ship by stealing bradley’s noise, the mayor launches the missiles at the spackle, where bradley, viola and ben are still negotiating terms. however, the missiles and 'cluster bombs' later fired does not explode. the mayor decides to try something different, remembering a trick bradley’s grandfather had taught his grandson. he remixes the fuel and releases it. the fuel mixture is the same used by viola's campfire box in 'the knife of never letting go' when only a few drops blew up the bridge between old prentisstown and farbranch. the fire kills many spackles, including the sky, and the return becomes the new sky. todd attempts to call viola, but is cut off by the mayor. however, todd manages to convey that they are headed for the ocean. the new sky then releases the water as a retort. in this process, the town is swept away, and the army, previously controlled by the mayor, returns to self-control. humans and the sky then manages a ceasefire. the mayor then lands at the ocean. the new sky decides to attack the settlers, while the mayor had ordered his remaining captains to attack the answer and march into the town square to die. however, lee, using a rifle with wilf's help, kills captain tate and the soldiers join the remaining people. wilf and ben manage to dissuade the sky from the attack, wilf’s honest and open noise showing the sky how to listen to the land, leaving the mayor disappointed. viola and bradley now ride to the ocean in hopes of aiding todd. however, acorn, viola's horse, dies from exhaustion, and she is forced to ride angharrad while bradley is left behind. at the ocean, the mayor congratulates todd, then says he will be a fine leader of new world - a world he doesn't want to be a part of, as the mayor is dying, by his 'too much knowledge'. the mayor then fights with todd, using only their noises, and todd wins. the mayor then commits suicide by walking into the sea, where the killer fish eats him. the sky arrives on his battlemore with ben. he sees viola and todd, but mistakes todd for the mayor and shoots him in the chest with the acid rifle. todd’s noise disappears, and he dies, driving viola to threaten shooting the sky back. the sky, revealing that he shot despite knowing that it might have been todd, realises how wrong he was to do so, and feels the regret todd felt when killing a spackle in book one. viola stops short of killing him, realising that it would cause never-ending war, and that no one would remember todd, and everything that he had done, after. she warns the sky to get out of her sight, and returns to todd. ben suddenly asks if she can hear anything, swearing that he can hear todd’s noise. the spackle attempt to cure todd with their medicine, and house him in the pathway’s end. the remedies are working, and his noise returns in burst on and off. the main convoy is about to arrive to a large ceremony, one which viola will not attend because she will not leave todd’s side until he wakes up, though she knows that he will be changed, like ben was. the sky has promised not to take the cure for the band infection until todd is cured, in an act of self-discipline, but viola does not forgive him and will not let him enter to see todd. everyday, viola continues to read todd's mother's journal to him, hoping that he will hear and come back. the epilogue cycles through todd's experiences in the coma. he is entering his old memories, at his school, at farbranch, but also human and spackle memories from all over new world. he searches for viola, unsure who she is, who he is. every now and then, he hears abstracts from his mother’s

when ying-ying approaches the moon lady after the play to wish to be returned to her family, she discovers the moon lady is played by a man. the second section relates important childhood stories of the joy luck club's american-born daughters. lindo's daughter waverly recalls being a national chess champion but her relationship with her mother is strained by how lindo pressures her and brags about waverly's accomplishments. lena st. clair, ying-ying's daughter, relates her mother's nervous breakdown and her mother is extremely withdrawn to the point where first her father and then lena winds up being ying-ying's voice. in contrast, lena notices and initially pities her neighbour's family, believing their noisiness is an expression of unhappiness but realizes later it is how they express their love. an-mei's daughter, rose hsu jordan, reveals how her mother lost faith in god when rose's youngest brother, bing, drowned in a beach outing. however, an-mei still insists that rose puts faith in her failing marriage. the section concludes with jing-mei's story, where she reveals how suyuan had high expectations that jing-mei would be talented like waverly and tried to shape a disinterested jing-mei into a concert pianist, which ended after an embarrassing piano recital. the third section follows the joy luck children as adult women, all facing various conflicts. in lena's story, she narrates her troubling marital problems and how she fears being inferior to her husband, but does not realize he has taken advantage of her both at home and at work, where he is also her boss and earns much more than her. waverly jong worries about her mother's opinion of her white fiance, rich, and recalls quitting chess after becoming angry at her mother in the marketplace. believing that her mother still has absolute power over her and will object to her forthcoming marriage to rich, waverly confronts her mother after a dinner party and realizes that her mother has known all along about her relationship with rich and has accepted him. rose hsu jordan learns that her husband intends to marry someone else after divorcing her, she realizes that she needs to fight for her rights and refuses to sign the conditions set forth by her husband's divorce papers. in jing-mei's story, jing-mei has argument with waverly at a chinese new year's dinner the year before the story begins. realizing that jing-mei has been humiliated, suyuan gives jing-mei a special jade pendant called "life's importance," which jing-mei rues that she never learned the meaning of the pendant's name. the final section of the novel returns to the viewpoints of the mothers as adults dealing with difficult choices. an-mei reveals what happened after her grandmother died; she accompanied her mother back to where she lived as the abused fourth concubine of wu tsing, whose second concubine manipulates and controls the household and has taken an-mei's half-brother as her son. after learning how her mother was forced into accepting her position after wu tsing's second wife arranged for an-mei's mother to be raped and shamed, an-mei finds her mother has poisoned herself two days before chinese new year, knowing that wu tsing's superstitious beliefs will ensure an-mei will grow in favourable conditions. ying-ying st. clair reveals how her first husband, a womanizer, abandoned her and how she married an american man she did not love after relinquishing her sense of control in her life. lindo jong relates how she arrived in san francisco and met an-mei hsu when they both worked at a fortune-cookie factory, which eventually gave her the means to plant the idea of marriage in her boyfriend's head. the novel's final episode returns to jing-mei and her mother's desire to find her lost twin daughters. jing-mei and her father fly to china, where jing-mei meets her half-sisters and embraces her chinese heritage. ||| 0 ||| 0
michael martin plunkett is a child genius who comes from a broken home: his father is a hustler and his mother is an alcoholic and drug addict who engages in a series of one-night-stands. after his parents divorce, plunkett takes solace in a series of disturbing fantasies in which he re-assembles his classmates' body parts. the fantasies lead plunkett to becoming a peeping tom, and from the time he is seven until he turns eleven, he spends all of his free time spying on his neighbors and observing people having intercourse. before he can graduate junior high, plunkett's teachers, having noticed his withdrawn nature in class, send him to the school psychologist, who identifies plunkett as disturbed but nonetheless passes him to high school after plunkett emotionally manipulates him into a fit of rage. in high school, plunkett, now realizing that there is something different about himself after his session with the school psychologist, seeks out some means of grounding himself psychologically. he becomes obsessed with a series of pulp comics and fixates on the main villain, "shroud shifter," a jewel thief obsessed with becoming invisible. plunkett comes to the conclusion that his own goal should become "invisibility" in the sense that he can move through life as nondescript as possible. plunkett steals from his mother to finance a series of wardrobes which will allow him to blend in with as diverse a number of people as possible; she punishes him, and in retribution, he switches her muscle relaxers with massive quantities of amphetamines. she suffers a psychotic break and slits her writs; plunkett drinks her blood and then calls an ambulance, reporting the suicide. he is placed in the foster care of an lapd officer, whom plunkett sets about manipulating in order to gain knowledge of how to become a good criminal. he begins committing a series of fetishistic burglaries in which he breaks into women's homes, kills their pets, and steals from them after watching them engage in intercourse. following the tate/labianca murders, plunkett attempts to meet charles manson, only to improperly identify a generic hippie as manson and break into an apartment where he is having sex. the hippie apprehends plunkett, and plunkett is sentenced to a year in prison. in prison, plunkett works to perfect his body while studying under other criminals and learning their techniques. doing janitorial work as a trusty, he encounters the recently incarcerated manson; furious that the rambling, barely coherent manson is being held up as a paragon of evil, plunkett resolves that upon his release he will become the kind of killer truly worthy of that distinction. upon his release from prison, plunkett delves further into his fantasy life, which begins to spill over into his waking life as shroud shifter appears to him in a series of schizophrenic visions, encouraging him to commit more violent crimes. finally, one night, plunkett abruptly lashes out and kills a girl and her boyfriend who had invited him to their apartment to smoke marijuana. plunkett successfully covers up his crime by making the murder appear to be the work of drug dealers; now fully entrenched in a version of his fantasy life that overlaps with reality, plunkett embarks on a road trip across the western united states, picking up hitch hikers and brutally mutilating and murdering them, then selling their belongings to fences to finance his lifestyle. as time progresses and his body count rises, plunkett perfects his techniques, outfitting a dodge van with a series of hidden compartments and living amenities so that it can act as both his mobile home and murder factory. after hastily killing a man in the snow, plunkett is apprehended by wisconsin state police sergeant ross anderson, who reveals himself to be a serial killer responsible for three (later seven) brutal rape/murders of young coeds. anderson and plunkett become romantically involved and anderson uses his influence to protect plunkett as his own murders increase in number and brutality. fbi agent thomas dusenberg is tasked with identifying and apprehending anderson and plunkett. he eventually captures anderson, who gives up plunkett in exchange for immunity from the death penalty. after plunkett sees his own photo on wanted posters, he reasons--using a chain of paranoid logic-- that anderson's family identified him as a serial killer. plunkett goes to anderson's house, where he violently mutilates and murders his entire family. in the course of killing the last member of anderson's family, plunkett experiences a moment of lucidity during which he realizes that anderson's family had no role in his being identified. plunkett nevertheless desecrates all of anderson's family's corpses, then goes to a motel where he identifies himself to the manager and waits to be turned in. eventually, dusenberg arrives with a strike team, and plunkett surrenders. he only confesses to crimes in non-death-penalty states, assuring via an immunity deal that he will never be executed. he is sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole, and placed into solitary confinement in sing sing prison. remaining in a catatonic state for an extended period of time, he finally breaks his silence by contacting a publisher and asking for assistance writing his memoirs (which make up the bulk of the novel). dusenberg, troubled by plunkett's motiveless murders, seeks solace in his family, only to discover that his wife has been having an affair. when he confronts her about it, she attempts to rationalize it before begging for forgiveness, all the while attempting to shift blame off of herself. dusenberg sells his diary to plunkett's agent for use in plunkett's book, then commits suicide, leaving his entire estate to his children. in sing sing, plunkett finishes his memoirs. believing that he has reached the pinnacle of human existence, and robbed of further murder opportunities, he announces his intention to commit suicide by using his mental prowess to will himself into a state of brain death. ||| 1 ||| 6
max is sent to interview a rich man, barrington boles, who claims to have invented a machine that can break through the barrier between parallel worlds, or "paras." max first assumes the man is a typical loony, but after returning home, he finds his apartment burglarized by identical triplets who don't seem to know one another. later, he meets four "sisters" who look almost but not quite identical, and who claim never to have met before the previous night. mystified, he rushes back to boles's place to ask the inventor what on earth is going on. boles informs him that the machine must have turned max into a nexus who pulls the inhabitants of other worlds into his own. max is frantic, but boles reassures him that the effect will probably wear off in a few days, and that if it doesn't, he should come back on tuesday. max tries to resume his life, but his neighbor's canary turns into a hundred identical birds, and the next day max runs into a double of himself at work. the double (whom he calls "mitch" to avoid confusion) has no idea what's going on, apparently coming from a para where max never interviewed boles. after max explains the situation to him, they decide to pose as twins. they go to a zoo to work on a story about a painting elephant, only to find the zoo overrun by fifty female chimps. sensing that the situation has gotten out of hand, max and mitch decide to visit boles again. but on the way, they spot a herd of bighorn sheep and a condor, species extinct in los angeles. max realizes that he's no longer simply pulling things from other worlds into his own, but drifting into other worlds (apparently taking mitch with him). when they arrive at boles's mansion, this version of boles doesn't remember their second meeting and has no idea how to help them. on their way home, max and mitch encounter two identical pairs of english-speaking aliens who don't understand why the local spaceport has vanished. later, max gets briefly separated from mitch, and when he returns, mitch has been replaced by a female version of max who is an actress rather than a reporter. after he successfully convinces her what has happened, the two go home and make love, realizing that they're the only two people who know exactly how to satisfy each other. in this para, australia has become the dominant power in the world due to discovering a cheap form of electricity. after falling asleep on a couch at her workplace, he wakes up in his own workplace, where a familiar coworker invites him to a basketball game on the weekend. he assumes that the effect has finally worn off and that he has returned to his original world, until he discovers that the entire world has been taken over by elder gods (of h. p. lovecraft fame), who demand weekly human sacrifices. somehow, earth's populace has adapted to this reality so completely that everyone continues to live relatively "normal" lives that include tabloid newspapers and professional basketball. after fleeing his building and entering a subway station, he shifts to a new para where the entire world has been destroyed, and he meets a sickly version of himself who informs him that this was the result of the "boles effect." max next finds himself in a utopian, futuristic version of los angeles with hovercars, courteous citizens, and no pollution. while he would love to remain there, he has no control over the boles effect, and soon he finds himself back in a more familiar version of l.a. he goes home, but when he wakes up the next day he discovers that he's a ghost, because the local max died in a shooting. he wanders out onto the beach, converses with an old man ghost, and soon encounters two identical couples who have just died—implying that the boles effect works even on the dead. after shifting to a para where he's alive once again, max is at the end of his ropes, bewildered by the metaphysical truths he has learned, disillusioned by the boles effect that never seems to end. after contemplating suicide, he finally goes home and sleeps again. during the night, he has a series of bizarre dreams in quick succession, and he concludes that he must have been "para dreaming," implying that "not only was the cosmos composed of para realities, it was rife with para unrealities as well." when he drives to work, he discovers that he's entered a para where every man, woman, and child in the world is a version of himself. everyone not only looks like him, but has aspects of his personality too, and for the first time in his life he becomes aware of how unpleasant a person he is. his boss assigns him to interview a man named max parker, who lives in what max thinks is his own apartment. this local max claims to be experiencing dreams where a man named barrington boles has zapped him with a condition that makes him sail through parallel worlds. max doesn't recognize the name of the newspaper that this max works for, the national enquirer. max has had enough. he concludes that so many parallel worlds must exist that "a single universe [is] but a pinprick." after having met so many clones of himself, his whole sense of individual identity is coming apart. his mind can't take it anymore. he drives to boles's house, witnessing some bizarre sights on the way, but hoping against hope that by the time he arrives he will have found a version of boles who can end max's condition. this boles remembers their second meeting and works the machine on max once again, attempting to destroy the effect. after all that he's been through, max will not allow himself to believe that everything is back to normal. but as he leaves boles's mansion and returns home to his apartment, he grows more and more relaxed—until the reflection in his mirror frowns at him while he's still smiling. ||| 5 ||| 7
with the opening of the novel, the island of leshp, which had been submerged under the circle sea for centuries, rises to the surface. its position, exactly halfway between ankh-morpork and al khali (the capital of klatch), makes the island a powerful strategical point for whoever lays claim to it, which both cities do. in ankh-morpork, a klatchian prince named khufurah is parading through ankh-morpork, where he will be presented with a degree in sweet fanny adams (doctorum adamus cum flabello dulci), but an assassination attempt occurs, and the prince is wounded. sir samuel vimes, commander of the ankh-morpork city watch, begins investigating the crime, originally suspecting both a klatchian named 71-hour ahmed and a senior morporkian peer, lord rust, of being involved. the attempted assassination breaks off relations between ankh-morpork and klatch as prince khufurah's brother effectively declares war on the city of ankh-morpork. at this point, havelock vetinari, patrician of ankh-morpork, resigns—apparently of his own free will—and lord rust takes command of the city. vetinari has refused to become involved in the war with klatch, due to the fact ankh-morpork does not have an army to stand against any opposing forces (the reason given being that killing enemy soldiers makes it difficult to sell them things afterwards), but rust declares martial law and orders the city's noble families to revive their old private regiments. vimes, refusing to follow rust (whom he considers to be a pillock) stands down as commander of the watch. captain carrot resigns as well, as do sergeant colon, sergeant detritus and corporal angua. the idea of putting the watch under the command of corporal nobbs is rejected by the ruling council of guild leaders and the watch is disbanded. vimes then recruits the watch into his own private army regiment, reasoning that, as an official noble, he is entitled to do so by law and by lord rust's command, with the group remaining independent as knights legally fall under command of the king or his duly-appointed representatives, neither of which exist in ankh-morpork. angua, following 71-hour ahmed, is captured by the klatchians and taken to klatch. carrot, rather than rush off to save her, reports back to vimes, who gets his private army to head for klatch. meanwhile, nobby and sergeant colon have been recruited by vetinari and his pet inventor, leonard of quirm, on a secret mission of their own, unknown to vimes. vetinari, leonard of quirm, colon, and nobby end up in leonard's "going-under-the-water-safely device" and discover that leshp is actually floating on top of a huge bubble of gas (suggested to be methane or some other poisonous gas), and that the gas is escaping from said bubble, meaning that leshp will, ultimately, sink back under the sea again. vimes catches up with 71-hour ahmed and has, by this time, figured out that ahmed is a fellow policeman. ahmed and his band of klatchian d'regs and vimes army head towards gebra, in klatch, where the war is due to start. to help blend in, vetinari, nobby and fred colon get hold of some klatchian clothing, though nobby ends up wearing the costume of a dancing girl and gets in touch with his feminine side. the three also head to gebra. arriving at gebra they discover that carrot has convinced the two armies to get together and play a game of football (he has an inflatable football in his backpack for just such an emergency), vimes is preparing to arrest the klatchian prince and lord rust for various breaches of the peace (such as being prepared for war) and 71-hour ahmed is supporting him. vetinari prevents an international incident by ostensibly declaring the surrender of ankh-morpork and offering war reparations. vetinari is returned to ankh-morpork, under arrest and in disgrace, but as leshp has vanished back under the sea again, the treaty was to be signed in a non-existent territory and thus the charge of treason is invalid. sam vimes is informed that vetinari has been "reminded" that the old rank of commander was the same as the old rank of duke. he objects, claiming that only a king can make a duke, but then realises that carrot was speaking to vetinari. since carrot is, of course, very much not the king of ankh-morpork his reminding of vetinari is all that is required for vimes to get his new position and rank. vimes "accidentally" loses his "dis-organiser" (given to him by his wife) which kept giving him incorrect information. it is explained that, had vimes reacted slightly differently in the beginning- staying in ankh-morpork rather than attempting to follow ahmed and rescue angua-, the whole history of the ankh-morpork vs klatch war would have gone very differently. the dis-organiser meets death at the end, but death rejects it. instead, he drops it into the sea, and it is swallowed by a shark where it may not have the most interesting calendar of events to deal with, but at least it finds things easy to organise. ||| 2 ||| 5
in order to escape exposure as former jacobites, robin and his sister have exchanged clothes, and prudence appears to be a tall youth by the name of peter merriot escorting his younger, beautiful sister kate. this scheme was conceived by their father, whom they call "the old gentleman." on their way to london, prudence and robin encounter gregory markham kidnapping a beautiful heiress named letitia, who intrigues robin. prudence knocks out markham with her sword hilt, and a friend of letitia's father, sir anthony fanshawe, arrives on scene to discover that the elopement has already been frustrated. prudence finds herself oddly drawn to sir anthony, whom her brother dubs “the mountain” owing to his massive frame. she slowly realizes that sir anthony is far more observant and quick witted than his exterior would suggest. "peter" and "kate" take london's society by storm – robin becomes the celebrated beauty of town and prudence, under the patronage of sir anthony, is inducted into the high circles of the london gentlemen. the pair is invited to a masked ball, and while “kate” lies ill at home, robin disguises himself and attends the ball, introducing himself to letitia as “the unknown” in order to woo her. promising to return in her hour of need, he vanishes. the old gentleman, prudence and robin’s father, appears on the london scene as the long lost viscount barham and proceeds to rapidly ingratiate himself into high society, despite the fact that his claim is, as yet, unproved. overhearing prudence disparage his manners, the much frustrated mr. rensley, the current lord barham who stands to be ousted from his title by the old gentleman’s claim, challenges her to a duel. this is foiled by sir anthony who manages to wound mr rensley before the duel takes place. startled by his unaccountable intervention, prudence begins to wonder if sir anthony suspects her masquerade. prudence is invited to dine with sir anthony alone, and it is revealed that, despite his air of oblivion, the observant sir anthony has guessed that "peter" is actually a woman. having fallen in love with her, he asks her to marry him. prudence refuses to marry him until her father’s claim is proved, therein elevating her to a status worthy of his hand. sir anthony agrees to wait but informs robin, the old gentleman and prudence that, whatever the outcome, he will carry her off and marry her when that time comes. markham, meanwhile, has obtained a document that could send the old gentleman to the gallows by proving he is a jacobite. in an attempt to blackmail him, markham exchanges the document for a letter that could expose letitia's father as a traitor. he threatens letitia, who is an heiress, with the letter and induces her to run away with him again. this event, despite markham’s belief, was orchestrated by the subtlety of the old gentleman, who is known for his great intelligence and cunning. the old gentleman dispatches robin, disguised as a highwayman, to kill markham and thwart the elopement, thereby disposing of the nuisance markham and inspiring letitia to fall deeper in love with her unknown rescuer. robin tells letitia that the next time she sees him, he will claim her as his bride. when questioned by the authorities, letitia gives a false description of the "highwayman" in order to protect her love. unfortunately, she unwittingly provides an exact description of peter merriot. prudence is arrested by officers of the law, and reflects that any deviation from the exact plans of the old gentleman, such as her presence on the night of the elopement, results in disaster. sir anthony, informed of her arrest, rescues her from the officers of the law and they gallop cross-country to the residence of sir anthony’s sister. there, “peter” dons a gown and becomes the dazzling miss prudence tremaine of barham. having spent so long alone in his company following the escape, prudence must now marry sir anthony and, happily, she consents to wed the man she loves. following “peter’s” disappearance, suspicion is cast over both the marriots, and so "kate" flees to france until the battle over his father's inheritance is resolved. the old gentleman proves conclusively that he is tremaine of barham and robin returns from france, causing a sensation as mr. robin tremaine, heir to the viscounty of barham. calling on letitia’s father, the future viscount is readily accepted as a future son-in-law. robin reveals himself to letitia as the unknown of her dreams, and she consents immediately to be his bride. watching robin, letitia, prudence and sir anthony together on his newly acquired estates, the old gentleman reflects that he had exactly planned everything to this end, and remarks, quite truthfully, that he is a great man. ||| 6 ||| 2
wanting to see the world, bunyip bluegum the koala sets out on his travels, taking only a walking stick. at about lunchtime, feeling more than slightly peckish, he meets bill barnacle the sailor and sam sawnoff the penguin who are eating a pudding. the pudding is a magic one which, no matter how much one eats it, always reforms into a whole pudding again. he is called albert, has thin arms and legs and is a bad-tempered, ill-mannered so-and-so into the bargain. his only pleasure is being eaten and on his insistence, bill and sam invite bunyip to join them for lunch. they then set off on the road together, bill explaining to bunyip how he and sam were once shipwrecked with a ship's cook on an iceberg where the cook created the pudding which they now own. later on they encounter the pudding thieves, a possum and a wombat. these nasty varmints are scum of the earth, barely fit to own the air that fills their lungs. bill and sam bravely defend their pudding while bunyip sits on albert so that he cannot escape while they are not looking. later that night sitting round the fire, bill and sam, grateful for his contributions of the day, invite bunyip to join them and become a member of the noble society of pudding owners. later the next day, through some well-thought-out trickery, the pudding thieves make a successful grab for the pudding. upset and outraged, bill and sam fall into despair and it is up to bunyip to get them to pull themselves together and set off to rescue their pudding. in the course of tracking down the pudding thieves they encounter some rather pathetic and unsavoury members of society, but eventually manage to get led to the pudding thieves' lair. bunyip's cleverness lures the robbers into a trap from where bill and sam's fists do the rest and they retrieve their pudding. some time later the pudding thieves approach the three pudding owners proclaiming that they bear gifts of good will and will present them to the pudding owners if they would only look inside a bag they have with them. when doing so they pull it over their heads and tie it up leaving them defenceless as the thieves take their pudding and run off. an elderly dog, market gardener benjamin brandysnap, comes along and frees the pudding owners. the bag had been stolen from his stable, and he joins the pudding owners to get revenge on the pudding thieves. another clever plan by bunyip lures them into another trap where the thieves are given yet another battering and the pudding retrieved. the next day the travellers come to the sleepy town of tooraloo where they are approached by men dressed in suits and top hats and claiming to be the real owners of the pudding. they turn out to be the pudding thieves up to yet another attempt at getting the pudding and the subsequent fight brings along the mayor and the cowardly local constable. in the argument that follows, the bad-tempered pudding pinches the mayor who orders his arrest. the pudding is taken to court where the only officials present are the judge and the usher who are playing cards, but they prefer to eat the defendant rather than hear the case. to settle matters, bunyip suggests that they hear the case themselves. bill becomes the prosecutor, the pudding thieves are charged with the attempts to steal the pudding and the theft of benjamin brandysnap's bag and the mayor and the constable stand in as “12 good men and true” &mdash; conceding that the unconstitutionality of the court is "better than a punch on the snout". the proceedings do not go well however and result in utter chaos. when it is at its height, bunyip suddenly announces that the pudding has been poisoned. the judge, who has been eating away at the pudding, goes suddenly crazy and attacks the usher, the pudding thieves, the mayor and the constable with a bottle of port. in reality, albert was never poisoned and the pudding owners take advantage of the confusion to beat a hasty retreat. they then decide that it would be best to settle down somewhere rather than continue with their travelling. they build a house in a tree in benjamin's garden and settle down to a life of ease. ||| 0 ||| 2
the gates are passageways through space and time that can, if misused, destroy entire civilizations. such cataclysms had happened in the past, most recently to the qhal, a species that at one time had enslaved other races, including humans. the union science bureau had dispatched a hundred men and women on a one-way mission to destroy the gates, closing them behind them as they traveled from one world to the next. morgaine is the last survivor of that band. in vanye's world, they had been opposed by an evil ancient being whose knowledge of the gates rivals morgaine's own. the creature had taken over the body of chya roh, vanye's cousin, then fled through the gate of ivrel to the land of shiuan. there, he had amassed an army by promising men and half-breed qhal a way out of their dying world. it had taken all of morgaine's guile to force a passage for her and vanye through the gate of shiuan into a third world, but they were powerless to stop roh from following with his forces. being two against a hundred thousand, they are forced to flee into the forests of azeroth, finding shelter with friendly villagers. eventually, the natives call on their qhal lord for guidance. morgaine meets with merir, lord of shathan, and receives grudging permission to travel where she wills. the invading army came through the master gate. morgaine heads to nehmin, where the gate's controls are located, but on the way, they are attacked. she is seriously wounded, but manages to flee. vanye is captured by humans led by fwar, who has a grudge against him. before he can be tortured overmuch, vanye is seized by the khal, who resent roh's power over them. they want any information of the gates that the prisoner may have. however, roh is informed and rescues his cousin. vanye finds the camp deeply divided: fwar's barrowlanders resented by the more numerous marsh people, both groups hating and despised by the khal, nominally led by hetharu, but themselves split into factions. roh barely maintains control over the rabble because of his knowledge of the gates, or fires as they are called in this world. knowing the situation to be unstable, roh tries to leave quietly with vanye and fwar's band, but the khal are alerted and pursue. it is a close race, but some of them reach the shelter of the forest, where the few barrowlanders not caught and killed by the khal are dispatched by roh and vanye. vanye guides roh to merir, but the lord of shathan has no news of morgaine. merir decides that they must go to nehmin for answers. there, vanye finds morgaine, recovered from her near-fatal wounds. the guardians of nehmin have ignored her counsel, distrusting her motives, and now they are under siege. at last, morgaine forces them to recognize not just the immediate danger, but the ever-present temptation of the power of the gates; they agree to close them after she and vanye depart, even though they are their main defense against the horde. before she leaves, morgaine offers her assistance against their common enemy. in the desperate fighting, hetharu and shien, his main khal rival, are killed. with fwar already dead, the enemy is left leaderless; the various factions unexpectedly turn on each other, ending the threat. there remains only roh to trouble morgaine. even though the gates will be shut down, he has the knowledge to reactivate them. vanye has discovered first-hand that the roh he knew and admired had not been killed when his body was taken over. gradually, that roh has regained control, or so vanye believes. morgaine is not entirely convinced, but allows roh to remain alive (though under watch) when she and vanye enter the fires and leave azeroth forever. ||| 2 ||| 2
the book begins with the words "there's been an accident! something's wrong!" - and something is. there is a ghost. she does not know who she is, or how she died, or quite where she is. all she knows is that there has been a terrible accident. the as-yet unnamed heroine finds herself attracted to a large building, a boys' boarding school, which she finds to be strangely familiar. after a little detective work, the disembodied spirit concludes that she is sally melford, one of a quartet of eccentric sisters (imogen, cart, fenella and sally) who live at the school and are neglected by their overworked parents, both of whom teach at the school. their father, only known as himself, is the headmaster, and his wife, phyllis, is the school nurse. both of them are constantly busy with school business, and leave their daughters to fend for themselves. as the plot continues, evidence of time-travel begins to emerge. in the present day, the adult, university-age sally is in a hospital, badly injured after her abusive boyfriend threw her from a speeding car. some part of her has journeyed back seven years into the past, where, with the help of her sisters and their schoolboy friends, she must undo a rash bargain with the powerful and ancient goddess, monigan. the worship of monigan is a game that the sisters made up, in which an old rag doll supposedly represents the goddess monigan. although cart, fenella and imogen treat it as somewhere between a belief and a game, the ghost discovers that the fourth, sally, is romantically involved with a student at the school, the enigmatic fifth-former julian addiman, and both of them take the worship of monigan very, very seriously. after a deal of detective work, sally (in her ghostly form) discovers the truth. the young sally had dedicated herself to monigan in a midnight ritual, with the help of julian. monigan had taken her up on the offer, and had agreed that sally would be hers in seven years time. the seven years are now up, and monigan had attempted to call in the debt, in the form of the boyfriend (now revealed to be the same julian addison) tossing her out of the car. however, sally survived; and, with the help of her sisters and her childhood friends, she is determined to cheat monigan, and take back her life. ||| 2 ||| 6

fire in the mist is the story of faia rissedote, who as the story begins is a shepherd from a small village. faia returns from tending her sheep to find everyone in her village dead from the plague. in her anguish, she loses control of her magic and destroys the entire village. this act is felt even in the far away town of ariss, where staff of the university that exists there to train mages travel to the village to see what happened. they find faia and bring her back to their university. faia does not fit in there, as she is a much stronger mage but has little control; the other mage students either don't believe in her power or dislike her for being from a humble background. she does meet and sleep with a young mage, which is expressly forbidden as sex is supposed to be harmful to magical talent. a series of murders occur; primarily targeting young mages with potential. the women at the university believe it to be the work of the men, as the murders resemble a much earlier legend which implicated the men. faia's body is taken over by the spirit of the murderer, who it turns out was actually a woman (and is the same person from the legend) and proceeds to start killing the mages of the university. faia defeats the murderer by surprising her with the fact that she (the murderer, in faia's body) is pregnant, and regains her body. she escapes the university, the staff of which still bear a grudge against her, in spite of explanations, and begins to travel. ||| 2 ||| 5

part 1 arthur, liz and lucy are traveling to meet rupert steiner, a former colleague of arthur's, who has been visited by gadzooks. they discover and translate the message gadzooks left (from dragon tongue) - scuffenbury, the name of an ancient barrow which, legend has it, contains the body of a dragon. meanwhile, at wayward crescent, david arrives to ask zanna for more information about gwilanna, as he has been charged with seeking her out and destroying the dark fire she possesses - the inverted remains of gwillan's fire tear. instead of helping him, zanna transports herself to gwilanna, charging david with alexa's care in her absence. zanna finds herself on farlowe island, where gwilanna is attempting to use ichor from gawain's isoscele and the threat of handing the dark fire to the ix to coerce the fain into illumining her to a dragon. she also planned to sacrifice david to underline her threat, but she decides to use zanna in his place. however, rather than summoning the spirit of the dragon ghislaine, gwilanna summons a darkling, which mutates a flock of ravens into semi-darklings before being destroyed by grockle, under the supervision of david, who then takes the obsidian which contains the darkfire. david and zanna return home to discover that their neighbor, henry bacon, has suffered a stroke and is in the hospital. david is reunited with liz and lucy, and receives a message from the dragon g'oreal, who dismisses david's suggestion that the dark fire could be transmuted and used to reanimate gwillan. david then learns about scuffenbury, and suggests that lucy travel there with tam farrell. he also reads an extra journal, and suggests she post it online in dragontongue, as a message to other daughters of guinevere. david goes with liz to visit henry in hospital, and henry dies during their visit. after henry dies, gwilanna, the sybil attends the funeral and decides to warn david that she will do anything to get her hands on the obsidian and the dark fire. gwilanna attends the funeral in order to try and deal with david, but he refuses her and she leaves. at the reading of the will, the group meet henry's sister agatha, a powerful sibyl. they also discover that henry has left liz and lucy £50,000; david his collection of arctic memorabilia and zanna his house. the will also asks that the arctic memorabilia be left in place, implying that henry expected david and zanna to marry. after this, agatha gifts zanna with healing knowledge, and suggests that she make her peace with david. zanna goes into town with alexa and gretel to open her shop, but on the way the group are attacked by the semi-darkling flock and are rescued by tam, who destroys them with the spirit kailar. zanna is injured, but uses her new healing knowledge to mend the wound. tam talks to david about rupert steiner, who has approached him with a story about translations of dragontongue found on the hella glacier expedition. lucy informs david that sophie emailed her, trying to contact him, and david leaves for africa. lucy then receives a phone call from an old friend, melanie cartwright, who has seen footage of a pennykettle dragon - presumably gadzooks - moving on the television, and is concerned over her own 'special' dragon, glade. david arrives in africa to find sophie's wildlife sanctuary in flames, which grockle extinguishes. sophie is already dead, and grace is preparing to cry her fire tear. however, the semi-darkling which began the fire is still present, planning on inverting grace's tear to create dark fire. pieter, sophie's fiancee, tries to kill it, but it kills him instead. david then distracts the darkling with the dark fire he already possesses, captures it and sends it back to the ix with a warning to leave the pennykettle dragons be. mutu, one of sophie's colleagues, tells david that he saw a woman dancing in the flames. david then leaves africa, taking with him grace's petrified body, and her fire tear, caught by groyne during the struggle. when he returns home, david is greeted by zanna, asking why alexa has grown wings. david informs her that alexa is a new species - an angel, a bridge between dragons and mankind - and when the dragons are revealed, people everywhere will aspire to be like her. he also tells her that the people, as the bears have already done, will travel to ki:mera, the fain's home world. in the dragon's den, david gathers the dragons in an attempt to transmute the dark fire and return it to gwillan. gollygosh will extract the dark fire from the obsidian, groyne will mix it with grace's fire tear and some icefire to neutralize it, and g'reth will wish for gwillan and grace to be reanimated. however, while david explains what will happen, gollygosh is momentarily corrupted by the dark fire, and releases it early. the dark fire then enters liz and she is knocked out. while zanna tends to her, david reanimates grace with alexa's help. he then sends lucy with tam to scuffenbury - not noticing that, in the dragon's den, gwillan is draining grace's auma into himself. part 2 lucy and tam travel to scuffenbury. on the way, lucy reads the article describing the last meeting of dragons, describing how eleven of the last twelve dragons shed almost all of their fire tears, then went into stasis, while the twelfth, gawaine, ingested all eleven tears and planned to use them to defeat the ix. lucy and tam arrive at their guesthouse, which is run by hannah and clive, and has one other guest, mrs gee. they climb glissington tor - the dragon's burial site - that evening, and that night lucy has a nightmare about a cat, which she encountered earlier in the day, bringing her a semi-darkling. in the crescent, liz is comatose, but seems unharmed, when gwillan suddenly wakes up. melanie cartwright comes to visit with her mother, rachel, and dragon, glade, who can sense moods. gretel puts the humans to sleep so they don't get in the way, and glade goes upstairs to try and check on liz and the baby. she finds that liz is all right, but the baby's body is in stasis, and its auma has been transferred to gwillan. the cartwrights leave, and david contacts g'oreal, informing him that grockle is destroying the semi-darklings. early next morning, tam and lucy climb scuffenbury hill to see the unicorn. while they are there, cairn stones - the remains of a monument on glissington tor - begin to rise from the earth and rebuild the cairn, revealing more chalk carvings - a unicorn's horn. mrs gee, a sibyl, has rebuilt the cairn to try and wake the unicorn and the dragon, but hannah, who claims to know all the tor's secrets, warns her that this legend is false, and waking the dragon requires a red-haired girl, touched by the spirit of a dragon. she also explains that the dragon in stasis is gawaine, who came to scuffenbury seeking the unicorn teramelle's healing to help her give birth, and offers to help mrs gee claim the dragon in return for one of its scales. gwendolen, left in the hotel to watch for the mysterious cat, is shocked to discover that not only is the cat real, it can do magic, and communicate. it tells her it is truly a girl called bella, who was turned into a cat by mrs gee. the tv news is showing pictures of dragons being freed all over the world, and hannah tells lucy that she can wake the dragon if she touches it and sings - and that there is a tunnel under the cairn which will let lucy touch the dragon. at wayward crescent, zanna is puzzled by e-mails lucy is receiving, which david tells her are from other daughters of guinevere. he also gives her tam's article, telling her that gawaine, the dragon in scuffenbury and the one chosen to fight the ix, was gawain's mother, and her plan to destroy the ix was to draw the ix to her, then sacrifice herself in the fire eternal - a plan which the new wearle has adopted. tam and lucy travel through the tunnels to wake gawaine, but as the dragon stirs, hannah betrays them. tam is trapped underground, and lucy captured by mrs gee, but bella helps her escape. in the chaos of the dragon's awakening, mrs gee, hannah and clive are all killed and the hotel collapses. meanwhile, melanie and rachel cartwright are attacked by the last surviving semi-darkling, who injures both of them before taking glade. glade sends a distress signal to the pennykettles, which is intercepted by gwillan. lucy calls david for help, and he sends grockle. with his help, lucy places some of her tears in glissington cairn, although bella tries to stop her. the tears reflect moonlight onto the unicorn's horn, bringing it to life, and it frees gawaine. however, as zanna discovers through an email bella sent lucy, gawaine was betrayed and one of her children murdered by a sibyl disguised as a red-haired maiden, and when she sees lucy, she attacks. grockle fails to defend lucy, but, as lucy is gawaine's kin, the flames do not harm her, and gawine is distracted for long enough that david can arrive to help. meanwhile, the last surviving semi-darkling ingests lucy's auma from the tears she left at glissington cairn. it uses the power in the tears to renew itself, and call the ix towards it, and a full darkling is born, with the ability to self-replicate, which it does until there are four darklings. realizing the danger, david gives lucy the narwhal tusk talisman which he thinks is groyne so that she can be transported home, not realizing that the tusk is in fact gwillan, who has taken groyne's abilities, and lucy has only been moved across the valley. gawaine and g'lant - the combined force of david and grockle - begin to fight the darklings. one invades gawaine's mind before she destroys it, but g'lant restores her before permanent injury can occur. one then distracts g'lant while the remaining two attack gawaine. one destroys her wing and poisons her blood, although it is near-fatally injured in the attempt, and falls to the ground near lucy, who has been joined by bella. as it attempts to attack the girls, tam emerges from the ground and destroys it. agatha bacon arrives at wayward crescent, and zanna leaves for scuffenbury after entrusting her with liz's care. she arrives near gawaine, who is gravely injured, and begins trying to heal her with teramelle's help. the unicorn warns her to hurry, as scuffenbury is the site of a portal to the fire eternal, and the portal will soon open. meanwhile, 'agatha bacon' is in fact gwilanna, who wishes to deliver liz's child. she refuses to listen when arthur explains that gwillan now possesses the child's auma. she uses a spell to trap arthur in an armoir and, with the use of gawain's iscoscele, draws the dark fire out of liz's forehead. the dark fire turns gawain's isoscele black, then proceeds to kill gwilanna before traveling to scuffenbury. alexa, who was locked outside by gwilanna,grows full wings and is then taken by g'oreal of the new wearle to scuffenbury. at scuffenbury, g'lant continues to fight the two remaining darklings. gwillan traps one, purifying its auma and turning it into a dragon, which is no longer any threat. at the sight of gwillan, the ix lend all their power to the remaining darkling, and it overpowers g'lant, but gawaine drags it into the fire eternal, sacrificing herself to save g'lant and fulfill the task the old wearle entrusted her with - eradicating the ix. teramelle, invaded by the dark fire, follows her. in the chaos which the dark fire causes, david, zanna, alexa and gadzooks come together, and gadzooks begins writing a word. david reassures zanna that everything will be all right, but things will be different. then david, lucy, tam, zanna, bella and the assembled dragons disappear. the book ends with the word gadzooks was writing: "sometimes". ||| 2 ||| 2

zingle may be the missing link. prince zingle manages to escape and get back home. chapter thirteen: the king's plum-pudding has been stolen, so he asks his wise men who did it. the wise men blame the fox, who is captured. the fox explains that he did not do it, as he was busy curing his family's sore throats by taking out the throats and turning them inside-out, then drying them in the sun. the wise men then blame the bullfrog, who is also captured. the bullfrog explains that he did not do it, as he and his wife were busy trying to save their tadpoles, who were eaten by a large fish. the wise men then blame the yellow hen, who is also captured. she explains that she did not do it, as her last batch of eggs accidentally produced a hawk, not a chicken, and the hawk took her away to a different country, and she spent the last nine days returning to mo. the king, furious at the wise men for being wrong three times, has them put into a meat-grinder, so that they are mixed into one wise man, who tells the king that the purple dragon stole the plum-pudding. chapter fourteen: the king holds a council of war to try to figure out how to destroy the purple dragon. they decide that the dragon cannot be destroyed, but at least they could rip out its teeth and make it harmless. they build a giant pair of forceps and clamp it to one of the purple dragon's teeth. the purple dragon winds its tail around a pillar to avoid being pulled by the people. as it turns out, his tooth cannot be removed, even though the men run to the other side of the valley; instead, the purple dragon is stretched all the way across the valley, so that it is no thicker than a fiddle-string. prince fiddlecumdoo cuts the purple dragon into fiddle-strings, and so the valley of mo is freed from its worst enemy. ||| 2 ||| 0
in the year 1957, cathy dollanganger is twelve years old and the second of four children (following her older brother, chris, who is fourteen years old, and fraternal twins, carrie and cory, who are five). they live in gladstone, pennsylvania with their parents, christopher and corrine. their father works at a pr firm while their mother stays home to care for them. their idyllic lifestyle ends when their father dies in a car accident on his 36th birthday. facing financial destitution, corrine decides to move the children and herself into her parents' mansion in charlottesville, virginia. she writes letters to her mother, olivia, pleading for shelter. olivia agrees to let them stay on the condition that the children be kept hidden; she doesn't want their grandfather, malcolm, to know about them. corrine tells the children that she did something her parents disapproved of fifteen years ago, so she is disinherited. however, her father is dying, and if she can win back his love, she will be the sole heir to a vast fortune. she also tells them that their real last name is foxworth. they pack a few things and take the train to virginia, leaving everything else behind. they make the secret path to foxworth hall, where they are escorted into small room below the attic by olivia. corrine promises to visit them the next day after she talks to her father. when corrine does return, the children find that she has been savagely horse-whipped by olivia, who tells the children that their parents were half-uncle and niece; their father had been malcolm's half-brother. she says that if corrine has any chance of winning back her father's love, it is that the children be kept hidden in the room until malcolm dies, and by then, corrine will receive her inheritance and be able to provide for the children. at first, corrine lavishes the children with expensive gifts and promises of a bright future, and visits them every day. she even attends secretarial school to learn the necessary skills to care for the children (this is never mentioned again after the first year). however, as time goes by, she slowly stops visiting with her children and loses interest in them, particularly the twins who have almost stopped growing due to the stress of being locked up. the children are physically and emotionally abused by their grandmother, who calls them the "devil's spawn" and threatens them with severe punishment if they disobey her rules. corrine continues to favor chris, though her love for her favorite child does not motivate her to free them. after the first year, corrine abruptly stops visiting with her children, leading cathy and chris to think something has happened to her, but cathy later suspects that her mother has abandoned them. the children initially spend their time reading and watching television, but then they decorate the attic with paper-made flowers to make it less scary for the twins. cathy and chris begins learning the basics to pursue their dreams; cathy practices ballet and chris reads dozens of books to become a doctor. corrine's abandonment of the children forces them to rely on one another for comfort and friendship. this leads to a new family unit, with cathy and chris assuming the roles of mother and father for the twins and resolving to teach their siblings in a makeshift school room in the attic. after nearly two years of confinement, cathy and chris begin to enter puberty. cathy becomes curious of the physical changes in her body; in one incident, she is admiring her naked body and chris accidentally walks in on her. after getting over the initial shock, he proceeds to tell her how beautiful she is becoming. their grandmother catches chris watching cathy and proudly proclaims them as sinners. she gives them an ultimatum: chris must cut off all of cathy's hair or all four children will starve for two weeks. when chris refuses to comply, olivia sneaks into the room, drugs cathy in her sleep, and pours tar into her hair, which forces chris to cut her hair off. the resulting starvation forces the children into desperate measures; chris offers his blood to feed the twins and guts mice for him and cathy to eat. before they can eat the mice, their grandmother leaves them a basket of food, with additional powdered doughnuts. months later, corrine suddenly returns and happily announces that she married her father's attorney, bart winslow, and was away on her honeymoon. cathy and chris are angry that their mother was on vacation while they nearly starved, but she shouts at them for thinking she doesn't care about them when she provides necessaries for them and refuses to visit with them until they apologize. their grandmother continues to abuse them, and even whips both cathy and chris when he talks back at her. due to their confinement, cathy and chris become sexually attracted to each other. they also begin plotting an escape. after distracting their mother during a visit, they take the room's key and make an impression of it in a bar of soap from which they carve a wooden copy. to finance their escape, they secretly steal jewels and money from their mother and stepfather. one night, chris is ill, so cathy goes alone. she encounters her stepfather sleeping in his chair. curious and confused, she kisses him. days later, chris finds out about the kiss when he overhears his stepfather telling his mother about what he thought was a dream. chris rapes cathy in a jealous rage. afterward, they feel tremendous guilt and shame. chris sincerely apologizes to cathy, who forgives him because she knew he didn't mean to do it. chris professes his love to cathy, and although she reciprocates his feelings, she is unsure of how to respond. soon after, cory becomes seriously ill, and cathy angrily persuades her mother to take him to the hospital. corrine later tells them that cory had died from pneumonia, leaving the older children devastated. now desperate, chris plans to take whatever money he can find in his mother's suite, but discovers that corrine and bart have left foxworth hall for good. chris tells cathy that he found out that he learned their grandfather died nine months ago after eavesdropping on the head butler, john amos. chris also tells her that he heard that their grandmother has been leaving food with arsenic to kill the mice in the attic. realizing they are the "mice" and that arsenic was placed on the powdered-sugar doughnuts, cathy and chris take carrie and slip out of foxworth hall before dawn to catch the train to sarasota, florida. at the train station, chris reveals the final horror: their grandfather's will said that their mother would be disinherited if it is proven she had borne children from her first marriage or has any in the future. their grandmother started leaving the doughnuts for them nine months ago, when their grandfather died and the will was read, therefore, it was their mother who made the decision to poison them. they abruptly decide against going to the police, at the risk of being separated and put into foster care. their priority is to be there for carrie and survive on their own. cathy is very angry of her mother's betrayal, and desperately wants to take revenge on her mother and grandmother, but decides that at the moment, she must be there for her brother and sister. she does declare that one day, she will get her vengeance. at the time of their escape, in november of 1960, chris is nearly 18 years old, cathy is 15 years old, and carrie is 8 years old. ||| 7 ||| 0
meg: hell's aquarium begins a couple of years after the meg: primal waters ended. the prologue starts with scarface, michael maren's pet meg, and angel's last surviving offspring from her first litter, hunting. scarface gets enticed by a new prospective meal, leedsichthys. while the meg's attention is caught by the new meal, another creature of even more gigantic proportions (~100+ feet long) quickly seizes the opportunity and kills the distracted megalodon. this larger creature, which was hinted at previously in the last book, is a liopleurodon, which has evolved the ability to breathe underwater (much like the kronosaurs from the trench) . danielle "dani" taylor is working at the tanaka institute with jonas, terry and mac. david comes home from college for the summer to work at the institute. besides its main attraction, angel, the institute now holds angel's five pups: mary kate, ashley, angelica, belle, and lizzy. angel's behavior changes; unlike before, angel refuses to respond to the feeding stimulus she has known all her life. the peace that the taylors have enjoyed gets destroyed when a working accident causes angel to go berserk, killing one of her feeders, injuring the other, and giving dani some serious injuries. angel's pups have separated themselves into two groups: belle and lizzy, who are just as aggressive as angel but fear her due to her size and ferocity, and the other three females, who are much more docile, mary kate, ashley and angelica. an animal rights group called r.a.w. (release animals to the wild) decides to try to get the tanaka institute to free the young females, even though the world knows the damage that angel and her mother did when she escaped many years previously. jonas and terry want to expand the institute to separate all of the siblings due to their increased aggression and appetite, but the state won't allow any expansion of the facility. angelica is soon attacked by one of her siblings while being moved, and is killed. the cousin of the dubai prince, fiesal bin rashidi, comes to negotiate purchasing mary kate and ashley for a large aquarium in dubai. they also want jonas to help them catch some prehistoric marine creatures from the panthalassa, a hidden underground ocean which is all that remains of the primordial ocean of the same name. michael maren had discovered it and hinted at its existence shortly before he died in primal waters. rashidi soon notices the talent and knowledge that jonas' son david possesses during a private showing of angel and they approach him and offer him a job for the summer. all he has to do is train pilots in how to use the manta ray submersibles that the institute uses. he goes off to dubai while jonas, mac, terry and dani deal with angel, belle and lizzy. in dubai, david falls for a girl, kaylie, who is recruited to pilot a sub for bin rashidi's mission in panthalassa. david helps train the crew to use the manta ray subs and he helps get mary kate and ashley situated in their new home. one of the young megalodons dies, but david is able to save the other's life. he gets a preview of what the dubai aquarium wants&nbsp;— including a kronosaurus and a liopleurodon. despite being offered lots of money, he refuses the mission of tracking down the prehistoric marine reptiles. back at the institute, pressure is mounting to release the remaining pups. scientists come in and find out that the megs have evolved to a state where males are not needed for reproduction anymore, so angel and the pups either are pregnant now, or will be soon. jonas and mac have an implant put into angel's brain which will allow them to control her brain stimuli which ultimately gives them total control of her. jonas and terry secretly arrange to release angel back to the mariana trench while the r.a.w. group decides to release lizzy and belle by themselves. lizzy and belle cause havoc and death with their release and cannot be reined in. david eventually dates kaylie, and she is chosen to go on the dive to panthalassa, and bin rashidi informs david of the dunkleosteus, the "monster fish", which, along with zahra, formerly called mary kate, resides in dubai land aquarium; this effectively captures david's interest in panthalassa, which plays into bin rashidi's plan to have david, who is the best pilot on the team, attract and catch the residents of the panthalassa sea. kaylie insists on going on the dive with him and they end up in panthalassa where they are attacked by many large and violent creatures and get attacked by a large 122-foot long liopleurodon. the two escape the beast by hiding in a wreck of a ship that may have burst through the crust revealing the panthalassa. eventually, the two make it to one of michael maren's underwater labs and end up killing a mosasaur when the legs of the lab crush the head of the creature. jonas finds out that david is trapped and uses the control they have of angel to help him save david. jonas gets attacked by another mosasaur, but angel kills it, attracting the attention of the liopleurodon. jonas manages to get the lab through panthalassa but not without problems. due to their aggressiveness and territoriality, the liopleurodon and angel too leave panthalassa and angrily fight over territory and angel's kill. david and kaylie escape the lab but find out that angel is caught in bin rashidi's nets. the liopleurodon murders the trapped angel and then sinks back to the depths. david and kaylie almost make it out, but they soon find out that the mosasaur carcass is next to them. as jonas wakes up, the liopleurodon kills and eats kaylie. david hasn't been having an easy time coping and he has concluded that therapy doesn't help, but he can't kill himself by cutting his wrists, so he will take off on a "business trip", either to destroy panthalassa or kill the liopleurodon in revenge for its murder of kaylie and angel. though angel has died, her pups are still hunting and reproducing.... leaving the opening for the next installation in the series "meg: night stalkers". ||| 5 ||| 5
ariane emory is one of fourteen "specials", union-certified geniuses. in addition to her research on azi, she runs reseune (founded by her parents) with the assistance of giraud and denys nye. emory is also a member of the council of nine, the elected, top-level executive body of union. two political factions vie for power in union: the centrists and the expansionists. the latter, led by emory, seek to enlarge union through exploration, building new stations and continued cloning. her political enemies, headed by mikhail corain, prefer to focus on the existing stations and planets. the expansionists have held power since the foundation of union, a situation fostered by "rejuv", which extends lifespans and staves off the effects of old age. emory herself is 120 years old at the start of the novel – and only just beginning to show signs of aging – and has been the councillor for science for five decades. emory's former co-worker and now bitter longtime rival, jordan warrick, is also a special. jordan has created and raised a clone of himself named justin. justin has grown up with and is very close to grant, an experimental azi created by emory from the slightly-modified geneset of another special. when justin goes to work for emory, she threatens to use grant, who is reseune property, for research. using drugs and tape to overcome justin's remaining resistance, she has sex with the inexperienced seventeen-year-old. this trauma causes him to experience periodic debilitating "tape-flashes", similar to the flashbacks that ptsd sufferers experience. justin does his best to hide the sordid matter from his "father", but jordan eventually learns of it. he is furious and confronts emory. she is found dead later that day. though it could have been accidental, there is strong suspicion that she was murdered by jordan. he protests his innocence, but agrees to confess in order to protect both justin and grant. because of his special status, he is only exiled to an isolated research facility far from reseune. it is later revealed that emory's rejuv was failing and she was already dying of cancer. emory's last project had been the cloning of a promising young chemist to see if it was possible to recreate his abilities. an earlier attempt with estelle bok, the inventor of the equation that led to faster-than-light travel, had failed miserably. however, emory believed this was due to the bok clone growing up in a different social environment than the original. emory's ultimate goal was to clone herself, with her successor reliving her life as closely as possible, down to her hormone levels and including two longtime bodyguard azi and companions, florian and catlin. emory also created a sophisticated and powerful computer program to help guide her replacement. with her death and the resulting disruption to both reseune and union, the second project is begun immediately. ari, the clone of emory, is raised by jane strassen, a top reseune scientist in her own right and the closest match to emory's mother olga. in addition, florian and catlin are replicated (a much easier task with azi). when ari is seven, strassen is abruptly transferred to another planet to simulate olga's death. denys nye, now reseune administrator, takes over ari's rearing. by this time, it is clear that the experiment has succeeded. not only is ari as brilliant as her predecessor, but due to technological advances, knowledge of the original's experiences, and better parenting by jane strassen, ari is several years ahead of emory's pace and better adjusted socially. when ari is nearly nine, the centrists, in a bid for power, attempt to use a scandal involving emory – the deliberate abandonment of a secret colony on the planet gehenna. the reseune authorities have ari legally recognized as emory's clone, entitled to take possession of her predecessor's property, in order to block the release of potentially damaging information. denys is forced to reveal to his young ward who she is and how much her life has been manipulated. because of deep administration suspicion of his loyalties, justin is warned to stay away from ari. however, he cannot avoid bumping into her from time to time as she grows up. she comes to like him and appreciate his skills, particularly since his interests lie in her own area of research. soon after she gains adult status, she has justin and grant transferred to her new department. however, when the sixteen-year-old makes a pass at him, she is shocked by his strong reaction. justin is forced to reveal the reason. ari discovers that emory's seduction of justin had not just been for sex, but also a major "intervention" to free him from his father's domination, so he could work for emory; it was left unfinished when she died. the younger ari repairs the damage as best she can. ari also comes to terms with the fact that she is much like her predecessor; it is sometimes hard to know where emory's memories stop and ari's start. she takes up the original's ultra-secret agenda, revealed to her by base one, her guiding computer program, and unknown to anyone else. emory had undertaken to restructure union society to, in her view, save it from eventual collapse. giraud nye had taken over emory's seat in the council of nine after her death. a major political crisis is precipitated by his death from old age, as well as the paxers – a terrorist group – manipulating jordan. an attempt on ari's life is barely foiled when justin's just-in-time warning enables florian and catlin to deal with an unexpected would-be assassin. such a major breach in security could only have come from a top-rank reseune source. ari suspects denys nye. when denys tries to lure her in for another try by promising to resign, florian and catlin kill him, much to ari's regret. ||| 5 ||| 5
thorn has left in the night in search of fone bone, while phoney bone and three of the villagers head for old man's cave, where they are met by gran'ma ben and lucius. meanwhile, fone and smiley have made it down from the mountains. they are ambushed by rat creatures, but thorn finds them and fights the rat creatures off. the rat creatures are terrified to discover that she and the bones were the ones who wounded kingdok. deep in the mountains, the hooded one tells the lord of the locusts of the bones' latest deeds. the lord of the locusts has doubts that “the one who bears the star”, with whom the hooded one seems obsessed, is as powerful as the hooded one believes, but allows the search for the "star-bearer" to continue. thorn, fone and smiley lie low for a few days while planning an attack on the hooded one. thorn explains how she believes the hooded one plans to use her and phoney to speed the release of the lord of the locusts from where it lies trapped in the stone of the mountains. she also explains her mistrust of gran'ma ben - thorn believes the tale of how her parents were betrayed by the nursemaid is a lie; she never had a nursemaid. meanwhile, the hooded one approaches roque ja and asks him to recapture the bones. at old man's cave, the survivors of the rat creature attack are gathered, along with a large group of veni yan warriors. gran'ma ben gives phoney bone a history lesson, telling him the story of when dragons ruled the world; their queen, mim, kept the dreaming in balance until the lord of the locusts entered her mind and drove her mad. the other dragons were forced to turn mim to stone, trapping the lord of the locusts inside her. the hooded one, she tells him, wants to sacrifice him to free the lord of the locusts. thorn returns to the farmhouse to collect her belongings. she plans to take on the hooded one alone, after a conversation with fone and smiley - during which it is revealed that the three bone cousins are orphans, and phoney, as the oldest, raised the other two - she is convinced to trust gran'ma ben, and the three set off for old man's cave. meanwhile, a patrol of villagers and veni yan warriors, led by lucius down, scout the area for rat creatures. lucius comes across the hooded one, who reveals under the hood a young woman, the same woman who was killed along with thorn's parents, alive and not looking a day older. however, it soon becomes clear the hooded one is trying to distract lucius to allow a rat creature party to attack. later, at old man's cave, with no word of lucius down and his scout party, gran'ma ben continues filling in phoney on the history of the valley and the nature of the dreaming. just then, gran'ma ben suffers another attack of her “gitchy” feeling, and sure enough trouble is afoot; a cloud of smoke rises from the eastern mountains, where the lord of the locusts lies. soon after, lucius' party arrives back at the cave, many of them wounded, and with a pack of rat creatures still in pursuit. lucius down relates to gran'ma ben his meeting with the hooded one, that she is in fact her now-undead sister briar harvester. gran'ma ben tells him that despite pleading with the council of dragons at deren gard, they refused to get involved in the fight, meaning the valley folk must face her and her rat creature armies alone. the villagers argue over whether or not to hand phoney bone, “the one who bears the star”, over to the hooded one to appease her, and in the confusion phoney slips away, leaving his star-bearing shirt behind. gran'ma ben goes after him, catching up with him in the mountains, but roque ja, who has been tracking them, catches up and she and lucius get into a vicious brawl with the colossal mountain lion. thorn and fone meet up with them and enter the fray, but she and phoney get knocked out and taken away in roque ja's jaws. fone bone, also knocked out in the battle, sees in his dreams the great red dragon, who hands him the royal medallion and orders him to save thorn. some time later, at the ancient temple high in the mountains, the hooded one prepares to sacrifice phoney to the lord of the locusts. phoney insists that there is a case of mistaken identity and that the hooded one has the wrong person, but briar reveals what led her to believe phoney was a person of great power; a huge inflatable likeness of phoney, the runaway balloon from his disastrous election campaign back in boneville, that drifted into the valley. with its fierce expression and the banner reading “phoncible p. bone will get you” (the end torn off; intact it read “...will get your vote”, phoney explains), briar took it as an omen that he would be the veni-yan-cari, the awakened one. gran'ma ben arrives on the scene and confirms briar's mistake. the locusts that supported briar's shriveled body leave her, a punishment by the lord of the locusts for her mistake. the locusts swarm on and try to enter thorn, but fone bone drives them away with the royal medallion. awake again, thorn leads the others to safety away from the collapsing mountain temple, drawing her cloak around her head like a veni-yan warrior. ||| 2 ||| 2
millionaire orchid fancier lewis hewitt has hybridized three black orchid plants in his long island greenhouse. wolfe is wild to have one, so he and archie visit new york's annual flower show, where hewitt's orchids are on exhibit. one of the other exhibits features a daily performance by a young couple miming a summer picnic. the woman, anne tracy, attracts the attentions of archie, lewis hewitt, billy rose and a young exhibitor named fred updegraff. during wolfe's visit to the show, anne's picnic partner harry gould is killed, shot in the head by a gun concealed in the foliage. the gun's trigger is attached to a long string that reaches to a hallway well behind the exhibit. after a little inquiry, wolfe shows hewitt how his expensive malacca cane was used to pull the string, thus the gun's trigger, and thus to kill gould. hewitt is horrified by the prospect of the publicity that would ensue should his part in the shooting, however indirect and unwitting, become known. wolfe offers hewitt this arrangement: in exchange for all three black orchid plants, the only ones in existence, wolfe will solve the murder and deliver the criminal to the police, without publicly disclosing hewitt's connection to the crime. hewitt terms it blackmail, but submits. earlier, archie had noticed a woman waiting in the hallway behind the exhibit, at around the time that the murderer would have been deploying the string. he now finds her in the crowd that's gawking at the murder scene. in an act of detection that would strain the credulity of someone who was striving to maintain a neutral point of view, archie steals her handbag, removes it to the men's room, searches it for identification, and learns her name (rose lasher) and address. he returns the handbag to her – all without miss lasher or anyone else noticing. the police want to know more about her and, finishing their questions, they let her go — but surreptitiously follow her. the police lose her trail but archie knows her home address, where she has been living with harry gould. he arrives at miss lasher's apartment just as she is about to flee the city, and takes her to wolfe's house. there archie searches her suitcase and finds some printed matter that rose cannot or will not explain: a clipping of an article by lewis hewitt on kurume yellows, a plant disease that is fatal to broadleaf evergreens; a postcard to rose from harry, postmarked salamanca, new york (in the western part of the state); and a work order from a garage, also in salamanca. wolfe gets miss lasher to discuss some of gould's unsavory qualities. wolfe learns that although gould was employed as a gardener, he suddenly acquired a bank account containing several thousand dollars and what miss lasher terms "a big roll of bills." from his general awareness of horticultural events, wolfe knows that an attack of kurume yellows devastated a plantation of a new hybrid of broadleaf evergreens, about eighty miles west of salamanca and owned by updegraff nurseries. weighing all this information, wolfe concludes that gould had known the updegraff plantation had been deliberately infected, and was blackmailing the miscreant – who then killed gould. wolfe gathers the main players in an appropriate location – his plant rooms, specifically the fumigating room – and exposes the murderer's identity. wolfe therefore keeps the black orchids, which subsequently have a cameo role in the second novella in this collection, "cordially invited to meet death." ||| 6 ||| 6

the book begins with the birth of alhammit alhammitson, or mitt, in south dalemark, near a seaport called holand. when mitt is a young child, his family are evicted from their farm when the rent is doubled by earl hadd, the cruel and tyrannical ruler of south dalemark. the entire family is forced to move to an unpleasant tenement in the city of holand, where mitt's father joins the free holanders, a resistance against earl hadd. however, after a raid on a warehouse which goes fatally wrong, mitt's father disappears, most likely killed by the soldiers. mitt and his mother milda are convinced that three of the elder free holanders, siriol, dideo and ham, betrayed the younger members to the earls soldiers because they were scared of the consequences of raiding the warehouse. mitt is determined to take revenge on them for causing his father's death, and to do this, he joins the free holanders, hoping to bring them down from within. he ends up working on a fishing boat with siriol out of holand harbor. milda, meanwhile, marries hobin, a well-off gunsmith. mitt plans to take revenge on the free holanders by assassinating earl hadd with a homemade bomb during the annual sea festival, then letting himself be caught and, in turn, betraying the free holanders. mitt's attempt fails miserably, when the earl's youngest son, navis, kicks away the bomb that mitt planted at the earl's feet, but the earl is killed anyway by a sniper with a long-range gun, shooting from one of the many boats in the harbor. watching the festival are navis's children, ynen and hildrida (hildy). hildy is furious with her father, since he had allowed her to be betrothed to lithar, lord of the holy islands, whom she has never met. after the assassination, she asks the new earl, harl, to break off her engagement, but he refuses. to get back at them, she and ynen decide to make it look as if they'd run away and gone for a sail on her new boat, the wind's road. having been seen and recognized during the earl's assassination, mitt is forced to flee for his life. he hides on a magnificent boat—the very same one that ynen and hildy are running away on. they take the ship out of holand harbor, with mitt stowing away beneath deck, and when they are sufficiently far out to sea, mitt shows himself, and demands that they take him to the north, where he can hide from the earl's soldiers. although the two are initially uncooperative, mitt does his best to convince them that he is a rough, tough freedom fighter who will shoot them if he gets the chance; he partially succeeds, and hildy and ynen agree to take him north, if only because he has a gun, given to him by hobin. on the way north the three find, floating in the sea, the wheat figure of poor old ammet, which was thrown in the sea during the festival. this is considered good luck, and so they take him on board, lashing him to the prow as a figurehead. as well as this, mitt has a small wax figure of poor old ammet's consort, libby beer, which they attach to the stern. that night they weather a dreadful autumn storm with the help the two demigods, poor old ammet and libby beer. after the storm has passed, they come across a lifeboat, with one sailor aboard. after a few hours in the man's company, mitt realizes that not only is the sailor the man who shot earl hadd from the harbor, he is also mitt's own long-lost father. mitt's father, who turns out to be the actual betrayer of the freedom fighters and a truly bad person, forces them to take him to the holy islands. he plans to deliver hildy to her would-be fiance, the lord of the holy islands, the man she ran away from home to avoid marrying. hildy is determined to stop this, but before they can do anything, they arrive in the holy islands. upon being told the name of the wind's road, the holy islanders say that a great one "will come on the wind's road with a great one before him and behind." hildy and ynen are taken prisoner, but al forces lithar, who is a childish imbecile, to have mitt killed. the holy islanders refuse to harm him, so they maroon him on the uninhabited holy island. hildy, meanwhile, meets with libby beer herself. libby tells her that, if she wishes to return to the holy islands, she must trust mitt. hildy reluctantly agrees. on holy island, mitt encounters the two demigods in person and learns their secret names. when invoked in dire danger, the secret names produce cataclysmic effects that explain the folk names by which the two demigods are called on holy islands: the earth shaker for poor old ammet and she who raised the islands for libby beer. meanwhile, hildy and ynen are re-united with navis, who tells them that they were lucky to escape holand alive, as harl had been planning to kill them. al is about to shoot all of them when mitt arrives. he invokes the lesser name of poor old ammet, causing a great storm, during which they manage to escape. from the holy islanders they acquire a boat to take them north. before leaving, mitt promises poor old ammet that he will return to holy islands as a friend, not as a conqueror. ||| 2 ||| 2
whos your city? is divided into four parts with a total of 16 chapters. the first part presents data that suggests the world's population and economy are becoming increasingly geographically concentrated into few mega-regions, such as boswash and the san francisco bay area. thomas friedman's flat world theory, or his assertion that distance and place is becoming irrelevant, is countered by florida with maps of population growth, economic activity, innovation (as demonstrated by patent registration), and scientific discovery (as demonstrated by residence of the most heavily cited scientists). florida's maps show "spiky" concentrations in these mega-regions, although each region does not necessarily rank high in each category. for example, the taiheiyō belt ranks high in innovation but low in scientific discovery, and indian and pakistani cities show high population concentrations but low economic activity. florida explains the existence of these geographical spikes by insisting that talented individuals tend to cluster to one another, creating a (non-linear) multiplier effect that attracts additional talented individuals to that geographical area. the second part of the book presents evidence that globalization is creating a new class divide: those who are able to move to a different community to take advantage of opportunity and those who are rooted. this mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values, culture, economic specialization, and other factors, and businesses are following the most talented people to these cities despite high land prices and labor costs. florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class. finally, globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate. the third part of who's your city? examines the role of "where someone lives" as a factor of happiness. florida's "place and happiness survey", which he conducted with the gallup organization, shows that higher incomes and levels of education produces more community satisfaction, married people tend to be more satisfied with their community than singles, as older people as compared to younger people. in addition, renters are slightly more satisfied with their living arrangements than home owners, and people are generally satisfied with where they live. adding psychological profiles to his previous work, florida was able to find strong connections between the big five personality traits and regions in the united states. for example, neuroticism is concentrated in the new york metropolitan area and the chipitts area, agreeableness and conscientiousness in the eastern sunbelt area, extraversion in the chicago metropolitan area, the st. louis/nashville/atlanta area, and the south florida area. openness seems to be concentrated in the boswash and the san francisco bay area. florida explains the results by linking the dominant forms of employment in the areas with the personality traits: manufacturing regions require people who are agreeable (i.e., they follow rules) and conscientious (they work with dangerous machinery), areas with high immigrant populations require that their residents exhibit openness, and management and sales-related jobs need workers with extroversion. florida was also able to find that his "gay and bohemian index", which connects gay and artistic communities to high growth and wealth generation areas, is a proxy for regions with large concentrations of the openness personality trait. the final part of the book suggests that most people have three significant moves: when leaving their parents' home, when starting a family, and when retiring (or when their own adult children move out). when young people leave their home (or when they complete college), they tend to locate to areas that offer attractive job markets, cultural or recreational amenities, and rank high in quality of life factors. when they get married or have children, people choose areas that are perceived as safe and family-friendly. florida suggests using a "trick-or-treater index" to gauge if parents feel safe allowing their children to go door-to-door on halloween. he also cites catherine austin fitts' "popsicle index", which gauges how far are parents willing to allow their children to walk to buy a treat. once retired, or when their adult children move away, people tend to gravitate towards similar areas as young people, if it is close to their grandchildren, but in quieter neighborhoods that provide opportunities for hobbies or for a second career. ||| 4 ||| 4
in the late 19th century, the village of middleton is on the verge of bankrupty due to the tin mine running out, when a huge fissure opens in the moorlands. after a visitor called roger nepath offers to buy the mine and visits the fissure with the lord of the manor, lord urton's personality changes, and allows nepath to move into his manor house with his sister patience. the amnesiac doctor arrives at the village and befriends professor dobbs from the society of psychical research during his research into the fissure. dobbs's assistant gaddis claims to have empathic powers, which lead him to point along the fissure, where he is chased off by urton. the doctor notices that the water in a dam near the fissure has become warm and acidic, suggesting that it has been heated. returning to the fissure they find gaddis's corpse horribly burnt, which fascinates the doctor. nepath later holds an auction to fund his purchase, and demonstration a metal that returns to its original shape when destroyed, which nepath gives the doctor a sample of. the army gives nepath a large amount of money for him to create self repairing guns for the army, which nepath uses to buy more mining equipment. later, the metal turns into molten lava, which causes the remains of tardis to grow to normal size, although it is still a featureless blue box. dobbs and the doctor break into the manor and discover that nepath had been making many copies of his artifacts out of the metal, then selling them, as well as a young woman's body in a box, before narrowly escaping the urtons. going into the mines, the doctor finds that the tremors that caused the fissure opened up a new mine shaft, which is full of pools of molten lava, which is the source of the metal. the lava suddenly forms into creatures which burn dobbs to death whilst the doctor escapes. the doctor explains to reverend stobbold that nepath is helping living magma, with the power to reform itself, which has already replaced the urtons and mine workers. after an explosion, the doctor relises that middleton is located in an ancient volcanic caldera - with a new eruption about to start. the doctor meets the army on the way to pick up their new guns, where they are attacked by magma creatures and the new guns explode when fired, killing most of the soldiers. at the manor nepath explains that the creature has run out of resources in the mine, and he intends to release it into new areas, then take advantage of the resulting chaos. he reveals that the body in the case is his sister patience's, who died as the result of a building collapsing after a fire, and nepath believes that the creature can bring her back to life. escaping the manor, the doctor pushes lord urton into a river, where the cold water cools him into a statue, which crumbles apart. the doctor returns to the manor and tells him that the woman is not really patience. when nepath questions her, she embraces him as the magma leaves her body, leaving him trapped in a statue's arms. the army place explosives near the dam, which the magma accidentally explodes, releasing water that turns the magma into stone. nepath is freed from the statue, but the doctor pushes him into the water, causing him to drown. the flood unearths new seams of tin ore, saving the town's economy. the doctor leaves with the tardis's remains to wait for his meeting with fitz in 2001. ||| 5 ||| 5
vlad has traveled through dragaera for over two years. he now wears normal clothing, has discarded most of his assassin arsenal, and has lost a finger. while entering the village of smallcliff, he meets savn, a teckla boy apprenticed to the local physicker. the two strike up a brief conversation, and savn is often confused by vlad's behavior, as he has never seen an easterner before. vlad's arrival in town is concurrent with the mysterious death of reins, a former servant of the baron of smallcliff. vlad shows up again at the local inn, causing a stir. he talks to savn and becomes interested in reins's death. while most of the village assumes that vlad killed reins, vlad begins to believe that the death did have something to do with him. after some questioning, vlad determines that the baron of smallcliff is still loraan, an athyra wizard he killed during the events of taltos. the time savn spends with vlad in public alienates him from his friends in the village. savn takes vlad to some nearby caves at his request and begins learning about witchcraft, sorcery, and thinking for himself. vlad tells him that loraan is an undead necromancer who killed reins to draw vlad out for a jhereg assassin. savn also becomes acquainted with vlad's two jhereg, who are on constant lookout for assassins. recurring sections from the point-of-view of rocza reveal that she obeys the "provider" only out of obligation to her mate, loiosh. vlad describes his plan to tunnel into loraan's manor and use the caves' "dark water" to kill him. before he can put his plan in action, however, he is attacked at the inn by loraan's men. vlad fights them off but becomes seriously wounded before teleporting away. using vlad's comments about sorcery as a guide, savn locates vlad and treats his injuries, which include a pneumothorax. while the rest of the village searches for vlad, savn recruits the master physicker and they fight off vlad's infection. while recuperating, vlad confirms savn's growing suspicion that vlad has been manipulating him in order to get his help. savn goes to loraan's manor and discovers that vlad's allegations about him are true. savn is thrown into a cell with his master, who has already been tortured into revealing vlad's location. savn treats his master and kills the guard to escape and warn vlad. he contacts rocza and summons vlad into loraan's cellar, where loraan and the jhereg assassin ishtvan suddenly appear. savn realizes that vlad is still too wounded to fight off his attackers. remembering vlad's lesson about thinking for himself, savn dispels his irrational fear of his baron and uses the caves' "dark water" to menace the undead loraan. vlad uses the distraction to kill ishtvan, but collapses immediately afterward. robbed of his power, loraan simply begins throttling savn until rocza slips ishtvan's morganti dagger into savn's hand. savn kills loraan with the dreaded dagger, but the horror of the ordeal, and a subsequent head injury, snaps his mind. after reaching safety and healing completely, vlad resolves to take responsibility for savn's near catatonic state and seek out treatment for the boy he used. ||| 2 ||| 2

pingaree is an island in the nonestic ocean that surrounds the fairy countries that encircle the deadly desert that surrounds the land of oz. many years before this story begins, the armies of regos and coregos sought to invade pingaree, but their advance was repelled by pingaree's king with the help of three magic pearls given to him by the mermaids. the blue pearl gave the king superhuman strength, the pink pearl protected him from any form of harm, and the white pearl provided words of wisdom that only he could hear. buoyed by the pearl's magic powers, the king of pingaree led his people to victory and the invaders from regos and coregos drowned on the return trip. at the beginning of rinkitink in oz king kitticut and queen garee, the son and daughter-in-law of the victorious king are introduced. their son inga is coming of age to learn the secret of the pearls, and one day kitticut reveals their secret hiding place to inga. the next day, a royal visitor arrives at the island&mdash;king rinkitink of gilgad, a jovial and pleasantly plump fellow on royal holiday who remains on the island as kitticut's guest for several weeks. rinkitink's companion, other than the rowers from gilgad, is a surly goat named bilbil who seems to be rinkitink's opposite in attitude. invaders from regos and coregos come again to pingaree and seize the king before he can grab the pearls. all of the buildings are torn down, and all of the people are carried into slavery. the only ones remaining on the island are inga, who was able to successfully hide by climbing a tree, rinkitink, who escaped his pursuers by falling into a well, and bilbil the goat whom the invaders did not see any value of. inga realizes the only way he will be able to free his family and people is with the help of the magic pearls, so he comes to the palace floor to retrieve them. to make sure the pearls are not lost, he hides one each in the toes of his shoes and carries the speaking white pearl with him. the white pearl guides him to a boat the following morning, which he, bilbil, and rinkitink begin to row toward the island of regos. regos and coregos are respectively ruled by a wicked king and queen, king gos and queen cor. these two ruthless tyrants see no reason they cannot capture and enslave inga and his companions as they did the rest of pingaree's inhabitants. however, none of king gos of regos’ forces can lay a hand on inga, rinkitink, or bilbil when they are touching each other due to the pink pearl's power. they stride into the royal palace with the strength conferred by the blue pearl and force gos and his evil forces to flee the island to coregos and then free the king's slaves. inga and rinkitink wake the next morning to find the pink pearl is gone&mdash;it was in the shoe that rinkitink carelessly threw at a howling cat the previous night. while out searching for the lost shoe, the royal maid cleans their room and, finding the other shoe with no mate, assumed it was discarded and disposed of it accordingly—and with it, the blue pearl. at a complete loss, inga tells rinkitink about the power of the pearls and, at the advice of the white pearl, attempts to bluff gos and his wife, queen cor, into believing he still has the power of the pearls. cor uses diplomacy and trickery to capture him and rinkitink and bring them to serve her on coregos. nikobob, a poor woodchopper who resides on regos, finds the discarded shoes (unaware that they contain the blue and pink pearls) and plans to give them to his daughter zella. while he has the shoes, however, he encounters the giant worm choggenmugger and chops it into pieces&mdash;something he couldn't do without the pearls. zella is wearing the shoes with the pearls inside when she delivers honey to queen cor on coregos, inga recognizes the shoes, and he offers his new shoes to zella in exchange for his old ones. now with the pearls in his possession, he defeats cor and sends her fleeing to regos with the captive queen garee. the captives from pingaree and all the other places the invaders have been are freed and sent home—except for inga's parents. to consolidate the situation of regos and coregos, inga offers to make nikobob king of the islands, which he adamantly refuses. he instead asks to go himself with his family to pingaree. they learn from a palace guard that gos and cor took king kitticut and queen garee to the underground caverns of the nome king, and inga, rinkitink, and bilbil set out after them. although kaliko is a kinder nome king than the previous one, he proves to be a politician who "prefers to deal with the strong." kaliko considers himself bound by his word to king gos and queen cor and has kitticut and garee kept prisoner. before inga, rinkitink, and bilbil enter the underground kingdom, rinkitink asks inga to loan him the pink pearl in case they are separated. they are welcomed cordially enough by the nomes and spend the night underground, but the next day rinkitink and bilbil have an audience with king kaliko who is unable to harm them together while inga works his way through the three trick caverns with his strength and the white pearl's wisdom. princess ozma, the ruler of oz, is viewing what's happening to inga, rinkitink, and bilbil through her magic picture and dorothy and the wizard of oz go to confront king kaliko and resolve the entire matter. dorothy herself carries a basket of eggs to keep the nomes from attacking her (as eggs are poisonous to the nomes). upon her arrival, dorothy delivers stunning news to kaliko: king gos and queen cor are dead—a storm at sea wrecked their boat on their return trip to regos and coregos leaving the two evil rulers to drown in the nonestic ocean (according to glinda's book of records). kaliko, although shocked by the news, still refuses to release kitticut and garee. at that point, dorothy pulls the cover off her basket revealing the eggs, and a frightened kaliko immediately orders the release of inga's parents. the reunited father, mother, and son with bilbil and rinkitink journey to the emerald city, where it is revealed that bilbil is actually enchanted himself. the wizard asks bilbil how it is that he is able to talk when he is not from, nor ever visited, the land of oz. the wizard learns that the crusty goat is actually prince bobo of boboland, and the enchanter who transformed him into a goat is long since dead; however, glinda is able to change him back to human form. this also cures his bad disposition, which was a cover for bobo/bilbil's ill feelings. after a celebration, kitticut, garee, inga, rinkitink, and bobo return to the rebuilt island of pingaree for a victory celebration. soon afterwards, to his sadness, rinkitink learns that must return home to gilgad and fulfill his duties as their king...but accompanied by his friend prince bobo. in 1939, rinkitink in oz was one of six oz books specially re-issued by rand mcnally in a condensed, small-format "junior edition" for young readers, as a promotion for the mgm film of the wizard of oz. ||| 0 ||| 2

it is the bag lady. scared for her life, nora calls patch for a lift home. while in the phone box, patch lifts nora to his jeep. the car breaks down halfway and they stop at a shabby motel. in the motel room, she acknowledges his muscled body and touches the scars on his back. she falls into his memory about 8 months before she'd even met patch. after being pulled out the memory, patch forces her to the bed, demanding to know what nora has seen. gutted and frustrated, nora asks patch if he wanted to kill her, and he nods. patch starts to kiss nora when she is trying to escape. he then admits that he was going to kill her but he didn't go through with it. her quest for answers lands her in several dangerous situations, finally leading to the stunning revelation that patch, which is told in the memory, is in fact an angel who fell from heaven, and who meant to kill her, explaining why he was in her school to begin with. patch had found a way to become human through a text in the book of enoch. by killing nora, he succeeds in killing his nephilim vassal, chauncey langeais, making patch a human. dabria, patch's fallen angel ex-girlfriend, wants patch to save nora's life, thus turning him into a guardian angel so that they can be together again. patch insists on becoming human, following his original plan. but this plan goes nowhere because he falls in love with nora. in a turn of events, jules - a mutual friend of nora's - is revealed to be chauncey who wants revenge on patch for tricking him into swearing an oath that will allow patch to take over his body during the hebrew month of cheshvan. after leaving the motel, at her house nora is confronted by dabria, informing nora that patch wants to kill her so he can become human. dabria plans to kill nora herself so patch is unable to. nora isn't convinced that patch still wants to kill her but loves her instead. thoroughly denying that patch doesn't love nora, she begins to burn down the farmhouse. nora is saved by patch and he tells her to drive to delphic, then he kisses nora and seeks to find dabria. nora plans to meet vee at the theatre but patch arrives and ushers nora in the girls' bathroom. annoyed, she is still not sure on whether patch will kill her or not. he admits to nora that he couldn't go through with using nora as a sacrifice. he also says that if he hadn't fallen, he wouldn't have met nora. convinced, she passionately kisses patch, wrapping her legs around him but they are interrupted by vee calling, saying that she wants nora to come play hide-and-seek with elliot and jules. then the call is taken over by elliot, hinting threats at nora that vee won't be alive if nora doesn't play. patch then forces nora to stay in the car, so he goes off and went to search for vee. elliot calls nora again, threatening her more, she then disobeys patch by going and looking for vee. nora ends up with jules, explaining that he was chauncey, and he did all those attacks towards nora. furthermore, jules explains how he is getting revenge on patch for making him swear an oath (which he did in the prologue) by killing nora because he found patch is in love with nora. she then stabs him and runs for her life. jules corners her, and she notices patch behind him. failing to distract jules, he swings nora around and holds a gun to her head in front of patch. intimidating jules, patch possesses nora's body, fighting jules. patch then peels out of her and while unconscious, nora then runs up the ladder in the school gym and comes face to face with jules. aiming the gun at her, nora tells him that jules will die if she takes her own life and patch will become human. having fallen in love with nora, patch chooses to save her rather than accepting the sacrifice to become human. by saving her, he becomes her guardian angel, but also effectively kills chauncey, who had no soul to reanimate his dead body. at the farmhouse, nora asks him why he didn't accept the sacrifice, he answers that he'd rather be a guardian angel. in the novel, he says, "what good is a body if i can't have you?" the last chapter ends with patch and nora sharing a passionate kiss. ||| 7 ||| 7
the bulk of monstrous regiment takes place in the small, bellicose country of borogravia, a highly conservative country, whose people live according to the increasingly psychotic decrees of its favored deity, nuggan. the main feature of his religion is the abominations; a long, often-updated list of banned things. to put this in perspective, these things include garlic, cats, the smell of beets, people with ginger hair, shirts with six buttons, anyone shorter than three feet (including children and babies), sneezing, rocks, ears, jigsaw puzzles, chocolate, and the colour blue. the list of "abominations unto nuggan" often causes conflicts with borogravia's neighbours, and the uncertain whereabouts of nuggan leads the inhabitants of borogravia to deify their duchess, to whom they pray instead. this slowly causes problems as, on the discworld, belief grants power. borogravia is in the midst of a war against an alliance of neighbouring countries, caused by a border dispute with the country of zlobenia. rumour is that the war is going poorly for borogravia, though the country's leadership (and "everyone") denies it. polly perks's brother paul is missing in action after fighting in the borogravian army. paul is a bit slow and not altogether right in the head, and even though polly is more qualified to take over the family business (a famous pub known as "the duchess"), according to nugganitic law, women cannot own property, so if paul does not return, the pub will be lost to their drunken cousin when their father dies. accordingly, polly sets off to join the army in order to find him. women joining the army are regarded as an abomination unto nuggan, so polly decides to dress up as a man (another abomination) and enlists as private oliver perks (taking her name from the folk song sweet polly oliver). while signing up, polly encounters the repulsively patriotic corporal strappi, and the corpulent sergeant jackrum. despite her apprehensions regarding strappi, she kisses the duchess - that is, she kisses a painting of said noble - and by doing so, joins up. due to the shortage of troops, her fellow soldiers include a vampire named maladict, a troll named carborundum, and an igor named igor. they also include "tonker" halter, "shufti" manickle, "wazzer" goom, and "lofty" tewt. that night, polly encounters a mysterious voice, which assures her that although he or she knows that polly is a girl, they won't give her away. the voice also gives her some hints on how not to be discovered. over the next few days, polly makes a startling discovery: lofty is also a girl. since lofty and tonker are always together, polly assumes that lofty joined the army to follow her man, just like in "sweet polly oliver". later, she finds out that shufti is another girl, and a pregnant one. she also joined the army to find her man; in this case, the father of her child, who she'd only known for a few days, and is known as johnny. gradually, polly discovers not only that everyone in her regiment, except maladict, is a woman, but also confirmation of borogravia's bleak situation. most of her country's forces are captured or on the run, and food supplies are limited. this point is driven home when igor (actually igorina) demonstrates her surgery talents and saves several lives among a group of badly injured fleeing soldiers. the regiment, under the leadership of their inexperienced commanding officer lieutenant blouse, makes its way toward the keep where the enemy is based. meanwhile, thanks to a chance encounter where the regiment unknowingly subdues and humiliates an elite enemy detachment, including zlobenia's prince heinrich, their exploits become known to the outside world through william de worde and his newspaper. their progress particularly piques the interest of commander vimes, who is stationed with the alliance at the keep. vimes has his officers keep track of the regiment, occasionally secretly providing aid. polly and most of the regiment are able to infiltrate the keep, disguising themselves as washerwomen, and once inside plot to release the captured borogravian troops. they manage to do so, and borogravia is able to retake much of the keep, but when polly admits they are women, their own forces remove them from the conflict and they are brought in front of a council of senior officers, where their fate will be decided. with the council about to discharge them and force them to return home, jackrum barges in and intervenes, revealing that several of the military's top officers are actually women as well. but in the midst of this revelation, the duchess, now raised to the level of a small deity by borogravia's belief, takes brief possession of wazzer, her most passionate believer. the duchess urges all of the generals to quit the war and return home, to repair their country, returning their kiss of service, and ending their obligation to her. in the aftermath of this event, polly eventually discovers that even jackrum himself is a woman. the regiment is sent to the enemy and successfully negotiates a truce, and military rules are changed so that women are allowed to serve openly and maladict reveals himself as really being maladicta. polly finds her brother alive and well and returns home to the duchess. one of her regiment 'sisters' becomes the new leader of her country, having been driven by religious visions. sometime later, despite the peace they had desperately fought for, conflict breaks out again. polly sneaks away from her profitable tavern to seek new ways to fight a war using the influence she gained and finds herself in the role of commander of boy-impersonating females who are marching off to war. ||| 2 ||| 2

the main character, mr. plumbean, lives on a "neat street" where all the houses look the same. a seagull flies over his house and drops a can of bright orange paint on his roof, but instead of repainting his house to look like all the others on the street, mr. plumbean paints it to resemble his dreams. his neighbors send people to talk him into repainting his house to look like theirs, but everyone he talks to ends up painting their houses like their dreams also. in the end, all the neighbors say: "our street is us and we are it. our street is where we like to be, and it looks like all our dreams." the drawings were made with markers, and if one looks closely one can see the marker lines. in an interview in 1978 daniel manus pinkwater revealed the hallucinogenic undertones clearly referenced throughout the story. due to this interview the book was pulled from most libraries in missouri in the early 1980s. many believe the seagull was a reference to his older brother steven &#34;seagull&#34; pinkwater. ||| 0 ||| 4

set thousands of years in the future (ad 5407), the human race has been conquered by the qax, a truly alien turbulent-liquid form of life, who now rule over the few star systems of human space - adopting processes from human history to effectively oppress the resentful race. humans have encountered a few other races, including the astoundingly advanced xeelee, and been conquered once before - by the squeem - but successfully recovered. a human-built device, the interface project, returns to the solar system after 1,500 years. the project, towed by the spaceship cauchy, returns a wormhole gate, appearing to offer time travel due to the time 'difference' between the exits of the wormhole (relativistic time dilation), with one end having remained in the solar system and the other traveling at near lightspeed for a century. the qax had destroyed the solar system gate, but a lashed-up human ship (a great chunk of soil including stonehenge, crewed by a group called the friends of wigner) passes through the returning gate, traveling back to the unconquered humanity of 1,500 years ago. one of the crew of the cauchy returns with the friends, miriam berg. the friends have a complex scheme, which does not include a simple military return-and-rescue - the 1,500 year technology gap makes this "risible". from the wigner thought experiment they have postulated an unusual theory on the ultimate destiny of life in the universe. they believe that quantum wave-functions do not collapse like the copenhagen interpretation holds, nor that each collapse actually buds off separate universes (like the quantum multiverse hypothesis holds) but rather that the universe is a participatory universe: the entire universe exists as a single massive quantum superposition, and that at the end of time (in the open universe of the xeelee sequence, time and space are unbounded, or more precisely, bounded only at the cauchy boundaries of "time-like infinity" and "space-like infinity"), when intelligent life has collected all information (compare the final anthropic principle and the omega point), and transformed into an "ultimate observer", who will make the "final observation", the observation which collapses all the possible entangled wave-functions generated since the beginning of the universe. they believe further that the ultimate observer will not merely observe, but choose which world line will be the true world-line, and that it will choose the one in which humanity suffers no squeem or qax occupations. however, the ultimate observer cannot choose between worldlines if no information survives to its era to distinguish worldlines- if the uo never knows of humanity, it cannot choose a worldline favorable to it. in other words, some way is needed to securely send information forward in time. as a consequence of this necessity, they intend to turn jupiter into a carefully formed singularity and use the precisely specified parameters as a method of encoding information. miriam berg is more concerned over the immediate fate of humanity, with the threat of the future qax, and transmits a 'help' message to the gate designer michael poole. the qax, naturally, panic a little at the escape to the past. a complex, unavoidably fragile species in their huge living spline spacecraft, the few qax present are somewhat at a loss. they decide to build their own interface, with major human-collaborator assistance (headed by ambassador jasoft parz), to create a link to their future to gain aid in resolving the problem - with more modern gut-engine spacecraft they can make a 500 year link in just eighteen months. a startling high-technology future vessel (in truth, one of the legendary xeelee nightfighters, an advanced and long-range fast scout ship), with a future qax comes through the gate. its first act is to execute the qax governor of earth and gather up parz, before passing through the original portal after the friends and all humanity. the future qax takes two spline ships (presumably leaving behind the nightfighter; this might be the nightfighter that is discovered by the crew of the great northern millennia later in ring) through the gate and on the journey reveals to parz the reason behind its desire to completely destroy the human race. the future qax tells parz that over the centuries, the qax had worn down humanity through constant oppression, and had eventually decided to completely eliminate its space-faring capabilities. but before they did, as economical traders, they wished to get as much value out of their human pilots as possible. so certain pilots were dispatched on a number of dangerous or quixotic missions. one such pilot was a man named jim bolder. the qax had come into possession of a xeelee nightfighter, and had modified it to support human control. bolder's mission was simple: go to the great attractor, the cause of most galactic drift, and find out why and how it exists. bolder travelled to the bottom of the gravitational well, and found- the ring. a torus a thousand light-years in diameter, constructed of an unknown substance, rotating at a large fraction of lightspeed. the qax goes on to speculate that the torus created a kerr metric, and that it allowed egress from the current universe, that it was in effect an escape route for the xeelee. before parz, the spline warship, and the qax exit the wormhole, the qax asks, "what do xeelee fear, do you suppose?". regardless, bolder escaped the great attractor and returned to the qax home system, where he was supposed to be taken into custody by dozens of spline warships wielding gravity-wave based "starbreakers" and his priceless data on the god-like xeelee's ultimate project secured. bolder either did not, or somehow escaped; in the ensuing fight, the starbreakers were accidentally fired at the qax system primary star, and true to their name, destabilized it, causing it to go nova. the qax were forced to hurriedly evacuate. many died, and the power of the qax trading empire (and by extension, their occupation of earth) ended. in the past, poole joins berg on the friend vessel shortly before the qax emerges, having traveled aboard his ship, hermit crab, from the oort cloud. he is accompanied by a virtual of his father, harry. together they elude the control of the friends, whose project fails under the bombardment of the spline's starbreaker beam. they commandeer the singularity cannon used to sculpt jupiter, and fire some black holes into the spline. aided by jasoft parz's internal sabotage, poole succeeds in ramming the hermit crab into the spline, killing the sapience of the vessel. harry takes over in lieu of the higher intelligence, and at the direction of poole, steers it back into the wormhole: when inside, poole intends to activate the hyperdrive, shattering the fragile dimensional warping of the wormhole, and of all wormholes connecting to it, thus saving humanity from further interference by the future. poole's audacious plan succeeds, but with an unexpected side effect. as the hyperdrive activates, it sort of shatters space-time, forming a long series of interconnected wormholes that hurl poole 5 million years forward into the far future. poole discovers a sad cosmos, in which the stars are guttering out; the friends were wrong- intelligent life would not triumph and remake the cosmos, eventually leading to their prime observer. his ship shattered and broken, poole begins dying, but at the last moment, an "anti-xeelee" (whom it is implied is a being created by the xeelee to be like them, except traveling like a tachyon backwards in time, the better to mold the xeelee's early evolutionary history) takes a liking to poole, and converts him into an intangible immortal being of "quantum functions". in this form, poole travels the universe, but out of boredom, eventually begins to lapse into a quasi-coma- until an unexpected event occurs: a savage in a glass box, having traveled through a wormhole like poole himself. "history resumed." (this final event is one of the early plot points of the ring). pl:czasopodobna_nieskończoność ||| 5 ||| 5
it is four years after the events described in the first novel. jonas taylor, now married to terry tanaka, is working at the tanaka institute. angel, the young shark from the last book, has reached adulthood and is being held at the institute, which is now under the control of energy mogul benedict singer and his loyal assistant celeste after being forced bankrupt by lawsuits resulting from angel's mother's rampage at the end of the first novel. however, angel manages to escape after killing three teenage boys who decided to sneak into a walk area surrounding angel's tank. they harass her, and in return, she kills them by smashing the plexiglas barrier, killing two immediately, and soon eating the third one. jonas, with the help of his friend mac, jumps into angel's tank, where he discovers it is damaged and full of great white males hoping to impregnate her. jonas realizes angel is attracting the males by giving off a scent that is usually emitted during estrus, which she is going into. one of the males attacks and nearly kills jonas. mac hauls him out of the water, patches up the bite wound, and fires a transmitter dart into angel's hide right before she bursts through the gates and escapes. jonas is rushed to the hospital, afterwards realizing he nearly died. masao tanaka, terry's father and former owner of the institute, is not coping angel's escape and knowing she's tasted human blood. angel begins to look for the trench through instinct, wreaking havoc in her path, including killing several people and whales, including a whale released into the sea by sea world named tootie, who later becomes angel's lunch. jonas pursues along with celeste and an egotistical scientist named michael maren, who is secretly working with celeste. celeste attempts repeatedly to seduce jonas into revealing the location of an area in the pacific's mariana trench called the devil's purgatory, where he did top secret dives with the navy and first encountered fearsome megalodon but she fails. after many attempts to recapture angel, which all end in failure and at least one death, they manage to track her path and conclude she is heading for the pacific ring of fire, and then she will enter the trench. meanwhile terry is tricked into boarding singer's gigantic deep sea research station, the benthos, to check sonar records of the mysterious implosion of one of benedict's research subs, the proteus, which was exploring the trench. while there she finds herself at the mercy of singer and his sadistic russian crewman sergei. once in the trench, they find a prehistoric monster called kronosaurus that has evolved to hunt in packs and has evolved gills. terry manages to kill sergei in the airlock after he attempts to rape and kill her. afterwards, his body is eaten by the kronosaurs, along with the remains of captain hoppe, a captain who planned to meet with terry to discuss stealing a sub, called the epimethius, and heading to the surface to exploit the suspicion of singer's real mission, which was falsely believed to be the distribution of unis robots. she boards the epimethius on its next expedition, but it is ripped apart by kronosaurs. meanwhile, jonas is nearly killed on a mission to find angel, where he attempts to find angel in a zodiac, but he is nearly murdered out of caution by the ship's mate, harry moon, and angel after attempting to sedate her with seal carcasses filled with anesthetic. jonas, who had nightmares about dying in the trench, was rushed to the hospital, where he nearly died. he vows to stop his obsession with megs and live a regular life. however, celeste manages to use a drug to get the location of the devil's purgatory and heads to the benthos where terry has stumbled upon an undersea operation led by benedict singer to exploit rocks containing the rare gas helium-3 to create fusion, located in the devil's purgatory. jonas follows, along with angel, who has made it to the trench. jonas goes into the trench within an abyss glider submersible while celeste paralyzes singer, leaving him to die at the maw of a kronosaur as revenge for killing her mother. however, he tells her her father couldn't impregnate women, so he impregnated celeste's mother for him, thus revealing celeste is singers daughter. this does not stop her, however, and singer last words are, "i'll see you in hell." the walls of the room singer is in are destroyed, killing him and the kronosaur. however, this ends up destabilizing the benthos in the process. jonas lures angel into killing celeste as she tries to escape on board one of singer's subs, the prometheus, with the rest of the crew and rescues terry, who was nearly killed by celeste in the air lock like sergei was. she survived by unlatching a barrel containing a unis robot with the corpse of heath williams, a paleo-biologist who assisted terry with avoiding sergei's assaults. she seals herself in the unis and nearly suffocates, but jonas frees her, also killing a kronosaur via pressure changing in the environment it was in and causing its head to implode. on their way up to the surface, the last kronosaur attacks jonas and terry, but they are saved by angel who kills the prehistoric marine reptile. the book ends with angel giving birth to two pups, which flee into the trench. interestingly, osama bin laden is also mentioned as one

a strange, inexplicable malaise is spreading throughout earthsea. magic is losing its power; songs are being forgotten; people and animals are sickening or going mad. accompanied by arren, the young prince of enlad, the archmage ged leaves roke island to find the cause on his boat lookfar. they head south to hort, chief port of the island of wathort where they encounter a drug addled wizard called hare, who almost tricks them into following him into the dry land to their deaths. they realise that hare and many others are under the malign influence of a powerful wizard, who is literally sucking the life out of the world. they head further south again to the island of lorbanery, which was once famous for its dyed silk. all knowledge of dyeing has been lost however, and the local people are apathetic and hostile to the visitors. fleeing the sense of sickness and evil they encounter there, ged and arren again head west and south, out to the furthest parts of the reaches. increasingly they are coming under the influence of the dark wizard themselves. ged is injured by a spear thrown from an island where they attempt to land, and arren does little to help him. he can feel his life and energy ebbing from him and they both drift away on lookfar out into the open ocean. their lives are saved by the raft people, who live on great wooden rafts in the open ocean, only coming to land once a year to repair them. the raft people are so far unaffected by the spreading evil and ged and arren recover their wits and strength there. however, the sickness does reach the raft people on the shortest night of the year, when the traditional singers are struck dumb, unable to remember the songs. before ged can decide what to do about this, the dragon orm embar flies over the rafts and tells ged to sail to selidor, the most western isle of all earthsea, and the traditional home of the dragons. orm embar tells ged that the dark wizard is there and the dragons are powerless to defeat him without ged's help. ged and arren set out on the long journey to selidor in lookfar. after traveling over the open ocean ged and arren come to the dragons' run, a series of many small islands south of selidor. there they encounter dragons flying about them in a state of madness. the dragons have lost the power of speech and are attacking each other. they manage to survive the dragons' run, and land at last in selidor. orm embar is waiting for them, but he too has lost the power of speech. after a search they find the wizard in a house he has made of dragon bones at the extreme western end of selidor - the end of the world. ged recognises the wizard as cob, a dark mage whom he defeated many years before. after his defeat cob went and became an expert in the dark arts of how to cheat death and live forever. in doing so he has opened a breach between the worlds which is sucking all the life out of the world of the living. cob and ged confront each other and cob starts to gain the upper hand. with the last of his wits orm embar launches himself at cob and destroys his physical body, but is killed in the process. the grotesque remnant of cob's body, which cannot be killed, crawls into the dry land of the dead, and ged and arren are forced to follow. in the dry land ged manages to defeat cob, robbing him of life and closing the breach in the world. however, ged pays a high price for this as it means that he sacrifices all his magic power in the process. when they emerge back into the world of the living, after a dreadful journey over the mountains of pain, the dragon kalessin carries them back to roke island, many miles away. kalessin leaves arren on roke and flies on with ged to gont, ged's home island. arren realizes that he has become the fulfilment of the prediction of the last king of earthsea many centuries before: "he shall inherit my throne who has crossed the dark land living and come to the far shores of the day." in the intervening time, the realm had broken up into smaller principalities and domains, with little peace between them. now that arren will be crowned as king lebannen (his true name) they can be reunited. le guin originally offered two endings to the story. in one, after arren's coronation, ged sails alone out into the ocean and is never heard from again. in the other, ged returns to the forest of his home island of gont. in 1990, seventeen years after the publication of the farthest shore, le guin opted for the second ending when she continued the story in tehanu. ||| 2 ||| 2

the story begins with han solo and chewbacca on a diplomatic mission from the new republic to the spice mines of kessel. unbeknownst to them, moruth doole had taken over the space mines, and was convinced the falcon with solo and chewbacca aboard was a spy ship, a prelude to invasion to seize control of the extremely lucrative spice production facilities. his small fleet, based on kessel's solo moon, shot down the emissaries, and brought them to doole for questioning. he proceeded to do so by ingesting a large quantity of extremely pure glitterstim, which boosted his psychic capabilities to the point where he could forcibly invade solo's mind and ascertain the truth. when doole realized that they had been just diplomats, and that he had effectively declared war on the new republic, he panicked. when combined with the fact that he thought solo knew he had been the one that ratted out solo and chewbacca to the imperials (the result of which was that solo was forced to dump his cargo on the kessel run; jabba the hutt then placed the bounty on his head mentioned in episode iv), doole decided the best course was to place the two prisoners in his mines as slave laborers where they would no doubt perish soon. in the mines, the two, with the aid of a young kyp durron sought for an escape. simultaneously, luke skywalker embarked on his search for talented force-sensitives whom he could mold into jedi within his new jedi praxeum. lando calrissian, along with c-3po and r2-d2, aided luke with this search. in order to do so, he used a device that supposedly could detect one's affinity to the force. calrissian followed one lead to the umgullian blob races where dack, the possible force-sensitive, was rumored to have predictive abilities due to his successes at gambling. however, calrissian discovered that he was cheating and exposed him. rather than be punished by death, as was the law on umgul, dack was returned to the duchess mistral. in return, calrissian was rewarded with half of the one million credit reward. skywalker, meanwhile had gone to the infested planet eol sha where a man named gantoris was believed to have force-sensitiveness. after two serious tests, one involving fighting a fire dragon, gantoris agreed to come to the jedi academy, but was still afraid about the "dark man" he saw in his dreams that would one day end his life. after collecting streen, an old hermit on bespin, the trio made back to the yavin 4 where the jedi academy began. ||| 2 ||| 2

"the book opens and closes with a picture of little sal and her mother in the kitchen, the mother is canning blueberries... one sees in this opening picture sal entertaining herself by placing the canning rings on her wrist and a spoon, a simple childlike act which helps to set the stage for sal's obvious child actions throughout the books. this is not to be the overly diligent or angelic girl of so many other books, sal is a real child figure. she gets into mischief and causes her mom no end of trouble.” little sal's mother takes her to blueberry hill to pick berries. sal drops three berries in her bucket, then eats them. this continues as she and her mother concentrate on the berries and gradually get separated on the hill. what they don't realize is that a mother bear and her cub have also come to blueberry hill to eat berries for the winter. the book uses a number of visual and verbal techniques to compare and contrast the bear and the human families. both families pictures are similar in compositions, but they head in opposite directions when they reach the blueberry patch. little sal’s mother tells her that they can’t eat all the berries because they need to save them to can for the winter, but the bear mother tells her child to eat as much as it can to store up fat for winter. the bear's way of preparing for winter is more natural for sal who soon wanders off to eat. sal and the bear cub get mixed up and follow after the wrong mother. it takes the mothers several minutes to realize they're being followed by the wrong child; it isn't until the bear cub tries to eat from sal's mother's bucket and the mother bear hears the "ku-plink, ku-plank, ku-plunk" sound of sal dropping blueberries into her tin pail that they realize what happened. ultimately each child is reunited with its proper mother and they both leave the hill. just before leaving sal drops a blueberry into her empty pail. the end papers show sal again playing in the kitchen while her mother cans berries. ||| 0 ||| 0

as sandworms of dune begins, the passengers of the no-ship ithaca continue their nearly two-decade search for a new home world for the bene gesserit, while duncan idaho evades the tachyon net of the old couple daniel and marty, now known to be thinking machine leaders omnius and erasmus. among the inhabitants of the ithaca are young gholas of paul atreides, lady jessica, and others. back in the old empire, mother commander murbella of the new sisterhood attempts to rally humankind for a last stand against the thinking machines. the new face dancers continue to infiltrate the main organizations of the old empire at all levels, having also sent their gholas of paul atreides (called paolo) and the baron vladimir harkonnen to the thinking machine capital, synchrony. at the prompting of face dancer infiltrators, the spacing guild has begun replacing its navigators with ixian navigation devices and cutting off the navigators' supply of melange. navigator edrik and his faction have commissioned waff, the imperfectly awakened ghola rescued by the guild from the bene gesserit attack on bandalong, to create "advanced" sandworms able to produce the melange they so desperately require. he accomplishes this by altering the dna of the sandtrout stage and creating an aquatic form of the worms, which are then released into the oceans of buzzell. adapting to their new environment, these "seaworms" quickly flourish, eventually producing a highly concentrated form of spice, dubbed "ultraspice." meanwhile, murbella commissions ix to copy the destructive honored matre obliterators for use on the fleet of warships she has ordered from the guild. however, ix is now secretly controlled by face dancer leader khrone; previously acting as a minion of omnius, he continues his own plot for face dancer domination of the universe. omnius's forces have begun striking world after world, releasing a deadly virus and then pressing on to the new string of inhabited planets. the thinking machine plague arrives at chapterhouse and cripples the sisterhood, but they rally the unified humankind into one last great stand. aboard the ithaca, sheeana restarts the ghola project. gholas of serena butler, gurney halleck, and xavier harkonnen are about to be born when the axlotl tanks are poisoned, killing all three ghola babies and the tanks. saboteurs are suspected, as many of the ship's systems have also been failing. scytale, the last tleilaxu master, finally reawakens his own ghola's past memories, but only by dying in front of his younger self. the gholas of wellington yueh, stilgar, and liet-kynes regain their memories through various traumatic experiences. desperate to replenish their supplies, the ithaca lands on the planet qelso, a world slowly being terraformed into a desert planet by the introduction of sandworms years before by the bene gesserit. stilgar and liet-kynes decide to remain behind to help the natives slow the encroaching desert and prepare them for the inevitable. having successfully completed his attempts to create a new incarnation of sandworm, waff begs edrik to return him to the ruined planet of rakis so that he can spend what little time to live he has left attempting to reintroduce the worms there as well. unsuccessful, waff resigns himself to failure and prepares to die; as the last of his sandworm specimens perishes, a dozen sandworms erupt from beneath the surface. waff realizes that the pearl of leto ii's awareness that each sandworm carries had foreseen the honored matre attack on rakis and buried themselves deep beneath the planet's surface. knowing the planet has begun healing itself, waff is consumed by a worm, rejoicing that his prophet has finally returned. meanwhile, edrik and the ultraspice are intercepted by khrone, who seizes the spice and kills the navigator. the saboteurs are eventually revealed to be the rabbi and the ghola of thufir hawat, who had apparently been murdered and replaced with face dancers back on the planet of the handlers during the events of hunters of dune. in the ensuing chaos that follows the discovery of the face dancers, the ithaca is ensnared by the tachyon net. miles teg sacrifices his life in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent their capture. the ithaca is brought to synchrony. they are met by a party led by the ghola of vladimir harkonnen. seeing the young ghola of alia when he arrives, he immediately kills her; the original alia had murdered his original self 5,000 years before. the bene gesserit gholas of paul, lady jessica, chani, and yueh are then taken to see omnius and erasmus. omnius explains that to complete his domination of humanity, he requires the superior kwisatz haderach of the two paul gholas. paolo and paul are forced to duel, during which paul is mortally wounded. victorious, paolo takes the ultraspice; overwhelmed by the rapid onset of perfect prescient vision, he slips into a coma. paul, at the urging and efforts of yueh, chani, and jessica, slowly regains his past memories and is able to repair the damage to his body using bene gesserit physiological control. under the guise of aiding paolo, yueh takes his revenge by killing baron harkonnen, who had orchestrated the torture and death of yueh's wife wanna in their original incarnations. as this is happening, murbella has all the new ships in place and is finally ready to launch her fleet against omnius's oncoming armada. but the obliterators and ixian navigation devices all suddenly fail; murbella realizes that they have been sabotaged. when it appears that defeat at the hands of the thinking machine forces is imminent, the oracle of time appears with a thousand ships piloted by guild navigators and begins to attack the machines. this assault leaves the machine fleet in pieces. the oracle then tells murbella that she is going to synchrony to stop omnius once and for all; she folds space, and a visual manifestation of the oracle appears in the room where paul and paolo have been dueling. the oracle then removes every aspect of omnius and transports the evermind away into another dimension forever. sheeana and the young leto ii ghola free the sandworms from the ithacas cargo hold, and the worms wreak havoc throughout synchrony. leto ii regains his memories, and after the battle is finished, he tells sheeana that he must now go back into the dreaming. leto walks into the belly of the largest worm, monarch, and the seven worms twist together and join into one worm before digging deep into the ground. fresh from fighting the thinking machines outside on synchrony with sheeana, duncan enters the chamber where a recovering paul, his memories now restored, reveals that duncan is the final kwisatz haderach, having evolved and perfected himself through thousands of years of ghola rebirth and altered dna. erasmus then explains that he was the mastermind behind the rebuilding of the synchronized worlds. a mutinous khrone declares that the universe now belongs to his face dancers, as both humans and machines have been crippled. amused by khrone's attempt to seize power, erasmus explains that a fail-safe system had been built into the face dancers. the independent robot kills khrone and his party &mdash; and then all enhanced face dancers across the universe &mdash; with the simple flip of a mental switch. the immediate death of so many face dancers exposes how much they have infiltrated human society. erasmus then offers duncan a choice. with both humans and thinking machines battered and beaten, duncan can choose either destruction for one side or recovery and healing for both. choosing peace over victory, duncan and erasmus then merge minds. erasmus imparts duncan with all the codes required to run the synchronized worlds, as well as all of his knowledge. duncan now stands as the bridge between humans and machines. with little left for him, erasmus again expresses his desire to learn everything possible about what it is to be human &mdash; he asks for duncan to help him die. as duncan shuts erasmus down, he shares one of the many deaths he experienced with the independent robot. back in the old empire, murbella's forces are preparing to attack omnius's second wave when the machines suddenly stop. with the oracle having taken omnius, a navigator brings murbella to synchrony. she and duncan are reunited, and he explains his intent to end the divide between humans and thinking machines &mdash; the two will co-exist. duncan gives synchrony to sheeana for her orthodox sisterhood, while he returns with murbella to help lead the new human-machine mode of life. on qelso, the gholas of stilgar and liet-kynes continue to aid in the attempt to hold back the expanding desert, while simultaneously teaching the planet's occupants how to adapt to the changes that will inevitably come. under duncan's control, a thinking machine convoy lands on the planet; duncan offers the gholas the aid of the thinking machines in holding back the desert. he tells stilgar and kynes that just as he has become both man and machine, qelso will become both desert and forest. on caladan, the gholas of lady jessica and wellington yueh have returned to the ancient atreides castle. having removed all traces of the baron's occupancy, the two discuss how they will go forward with their lives. accompanying them is the unawakened ten-year-old ghola of leto i. looking forward to the time when his memories will be restored, lady jessica finds solace in the fact that she will be reunited with her duke. with the aid of the tleilaxu master scytale, sheeana and the orthodox sisterhood on synchrony have reestablished the ancient bene gesserit breeding program, resolving to never again breed another kwisatz haderach. at her side, sheeana has a young ghola of serena butler, heroine of the butlerian jihad. along with gholas of the tleilaxu masters, scytale has grown tleilaxu females from newly discovered cells, vowing that they will never again be forced into becoming axlotl tanks, in the hopes that this will prevent the creation of a vengeful enemy such as the honored matres from ever occurring again, and also vowing to never again allow the masters to corrupt the recovering tleilaxu people. on the recovering planet dune, the awakened gholas of paul and chani go about restoring the planet to its former glory. now that paul is able to devote all of his attention to her, chani remarks that he has finally learned how to treat his wife. as the novel closes, paul reaffirms his love for chani, telling her he has loved her for over five-thousand years. ||| 5 ||| 5
the story opens 274 years after the fall of hyperion, in which hegemony ceo meina gladstone ordered the destruction of all farcaster singularities to stop the technocore from eliminating humankind. however, the loss of the worldweb infrastructure also resulted in the collapse of civilization on most planets. brawne lamia, martin silenus and the consul were the only surviving pilgrims that stayed on hyperion. the consul left shortly and joined the ousters. his fate is uncertain. brawne lamia, pregnant from the first john keats technological reincarnation, gave birth shortly after to a daughter called aenea. lamia died when aenea was still a girl, and silenus took care of the child. when aenea was twelve years old, she entered the "time tomb" and disappeared. silenus hid his home and began cryonic hibernation to wait for her return. father paul duré was the only pilgrim not in hyperion. before the fall, he had farcasted to pacem, the dying catholic church's planet, and had been elected as the new pope, under the name of teilhard (a reference to teilhard de chardin). his papacy was determined to rejuvenate the church. when he died unexpectedly, he was reincarnated as lenar hoyt, due to the remaining cruciform on their shared body. with lenar hoyt as the new pope julius iv, with the help of cardinal lourdusamy, the church took a new direction. two new sacraments were introduced, the acceptance of the cruciform and the resurrection. the church had developed a new technology that improved the results of the resurrection, so the believers who had accepted the cruciform were virtually immortal. assisted by the immortality, the church grew steadily and with help of its military forces (called pax) filled the void left by the hegemony after the fall, as the government of all the galaxy's mankind. when hoyt died, he was resurrected again and again, and father duré never again appeared to the public eye. under the various hoyt's papacies, father duré was considered as an antipope that nearly killed the church. 274 years after the fall, raul endymion is a hunting guide in hyperion who kills a hunter in self defense (the hunter later resurrects). endymion is framed for murder and sentenced to death. he refuses the cruciform and appears to be executed. to his surprise, he awakens in the house of an old man named martin silenus. the old man tells him that he has been rescued to perform a mission: rescue his "niece" aenea who is about to return at the time tomb, find the old earth (silenus may be the last living human born there), destroy the pax, and "find out what the fuck the technocore is up to and stop it." endymion assumes that silenus is demented, but accepts the mission. he is helped by silenus' android servant a. bettik and by the old consul's starship. meanwhile, the pax also knows that aenea is about to arrive. they consider her an abomination and want her captured. the mission is assigned to father-captain federico de soya, who prepares an army of elite troops on hyperion's surface and in surrounding space to trap aenea. endymion and silenus's plan consists of arriving at the time tombs, flying on the consul's hawking mat. when the tomb opens, aenea appears as predicted. however, the shrike also emerges and massacres most of the pax military units - both on hyperion and in local space. in the confusion, endymion meets aenea and takes her to the starship, where bettik is waiting. the pax, fighting with the shrike, cannot stop the ship before it translates to hyperspace. the ship's first destination from hyperion is the parvati star system. the trip starts the friendship between aenea and endymion. he realizes that his young friend is far more precocious than a twelve year old should be, and he feels a hint of the mystique that she will have in the future. meanwhile, father de soya, badly injured by the shrike, is determined to not let aenea escape again. he takes possession of an archangel-class courier ship, the raphael, that allows him and three of his elite soldiers, (sergeant gregorius, corporal kee and lancer rettig, from the swiss guard) to fly to parvati faster than hyperspace. the price of this speed is a painful death and resurrection of the ship's passengers. when aenea and endymion arrive to parvati space, de soya is waiting to stop them. aenea threatens to depressurize the old consul's ship and die. since de soya's orders are to catch her alive, he has to let her go. the next destination is renaissance vector. de soya's team, after dying and resurrecting again, are ready to stop her even if she tries to depressurize the ship. aenea convinces him to allow her ship to land, but instead she flies the ship along the old river tethys through one of the farcaster portals, all of which have been inactive since the fall of hyperion. de soya guesses her plan at the last moment and attempts to disable aenea's ship, but too late to prevent it from farcasting. the ship has arrived to an unknown sylvatic planet through the farcaster. the passengers are all unharmed, but the ship is badly damaged. its ai states that it can be auto-repaired, but it will take about five standard months. since aenea cannot wait, raul constructs a raft to follow the river tethys. raul, aenea and bettik depart and leave the ship on the unknown planet. de soya, unable to determine to which of the hundreds of planets crossed by river tethys aenea has fled, begins an odyssey of continuous deaths and resurrections through all known planet systems in order to find her. the raft arrives at the next inactive farcaster, but again it works and translates them to another planet, mare infinitus. as they travel across the aquatic planet, looking for next farcaster, they encounter a sea platform occupied by pax guards. since they cannot avoid it, raul boards the flying carpet and goes alone to the platform, taking some explosives in order to create a distraction. he succeeds, but only after fighting with pax soldiers, losing the carpet, falling into the water, and eventually being rescued by aenea and bettik. they find the next farcaster and translate to hebron. strangely, they find this jewish planet absolutely abandoned. aenea and bettik find a hospital with automated surgeon units, which heal endymion, who is still injured from the mare infinitus adventure. meanwhile, de soya's search brings him to mare infinitus, where he finds evidence that aenea and endymion have been there, namely the flying carpet. de soya concludes that aenea's final destination might be ouster territory. hoping to intercept her, de soya and his men translate there, but there is an accident: resurrection fails, and consequently their ship is automatically rerouted to pacem. de soya is resurrected there, but one of his men, rettig has died the "true death". the pax government, in spite of de soya's consistent failures to capture aenea, decide to keep de soya on the mission, and assign a new officer to his guard, rhadamanth nemes, a member of a "new race of soldiers, prepared to fight the ousters." aenea, raul and bettik continue to travel through the farcasters. their next destination is sol draconi septem, a barely terraformed, frozen, high gravity planet. there, they meet and befriend the chitchatuk, primitive humans who are adapted to sol draconi septem's terrible conditions. the chitchatuk take aenea and her companions to meet father glaucus, a blind priest estranged from pax. at glaucus' home, aenea, bettik and raul rest and enjoy the priest's friendship. they depart again and farcast to qom riyadh, an islamic planet, which they find also strangely uninhabited, and then to god's grove. meanwhile, de soya has received information that it has been "revealed" to the pope that aenea is in sol draconi septem. de soya and his guards fly there in his archangel class faster than hyperspace craft, but something is wrong: nemes is not dead. in fact, she wakes up when the rest of crew has yet to resurrect, and takes a dropship to the planet. she has inhuman strength and skills and is ruthless. she kills the chitchatuk and father glaucus. she also links to the farcaster and learns that aenea has gone to qom riyadh and will soon head for god's grove. she plants this new destination in the ship's communicator, but de soya is suspicious. when they farcast to god's grove, de soya secretly gives the ship instructions to resurrect the crew in only 6 hours instead of the safer 3 days. nemes takes the raphael's dropship and prepares an ambush for aenea, including monofilament, land mines and a trap to beat the shrike, if it shows. when the raft transporting the heroes arrives, they fall into her trap. a. bettik has one arm cut off by the monofilaments while raul and aenea shelter in the rapids of the river. when nemes attacks, to kill aenea, the shrike appears and blocks her attempts. they fight each other to a standstill, but nemes uses her secret weapon. the shrike is transported 5 minutes into the future, giving nemes plenty of time to kill aenea and save her head. however, father de soya, barely resurrected and piloting the raphael in low orbit, talks to raul by tightbeam and lances nemes from outer space with a powerful energy weapon. nemes disappears in a lake of molten rock. blessing her, de soya guides aenea to the dropship and lets her go. the heroes pass through a farcaster to reach their end destination: the supposedly destroyed old earth, which is now orbiting a sun-like star in the magellanic cloud. aenea guides the ship to fallingwater, pennsylvania, where she will study with an architect (the frank lloyd wright cybrid) until she is ready to fulfill her mission. ||| 5 ||| 5
the epic begins with meghann "meggie" cleary, a four-year-old girl living in new zealand in the early twentieth century, the only daughter of paddy, an irish farm labourer, and fee, his harassed but aristocratic wife. although meggie is a beautiful child with curly red-gold hair, she receives little coddling and must struggle to hold her own against her numerous older brothers. of these brothers, her favourite is the eldest, frank, a rebellious young man who is unwillingly preparing himself for the blacksmith's trade. he is much shorter than his brothers, but very strong; also, unlike the other clearys, he has black hair and eyes. paddy is poor, but has a wealthy sister, mary carson, who lives in australia on an enormous sheep station called drogheda. one day, paddy receives a letter from mary offering him a job on her estate. he accepts, and the whole family moves to the outback. here meggie meets ralph de bricassart, a young, capable, and ambitious priest who, as punishment for insulting a bishop, has been relegated to a remote parish in the town of gillanbone, near drogheda. ralph has befriended mary, hoping a hefty enough bequest from her to the catholic church might liberate him from his exile. ralph is strikingly handsome; "a beautiful man"; and mary, who does not bother to conceal her desire for him, often goes to great lengths to see if he can be induced to break his vows. ralph blandly shrugs off these attentions and continues his visits. meanwhile, he cares for all the clearys and soon learns to cherish beautiful but forlorn little meggie. meggie, in return, makes ralph the centre of her life. frank's relationship with his father, paddy, has never been peaceful. the two vie for fee's attention, and frank resents the many pregnancies paddy makes her endure. one day, after fee, now in her forties, reveals she is again pregnant, the two men quarrel violently and paddy blurts out the truth about frank: he is not paddy's son. long ago, fee had been the adored only daughter of a prominent citizen. then she had an affair with a married politician, and the result, frank, was already eighteen months old when her mortified father married her off to paddy. because he resembles her lost love, fee has always loved frank more than her other children. to the sorrow of meggie and fee, when frank learns that paddy is not his father, he runs away to become a boxer. fee later gives birth to twin boys, james and patrick (jims and patsy), but shows little interest in them. shortly afterward, meggie's beloved little brother, hal, dies. with frank gone and hal dead, meggie clings to ralph more than ever. this goes largely unnoticed because ralph has now been her mentor for several years; however, as she ripens into womanhood, some begin to question their close relationship, including ralph and meggie themselves. mary carson has also noticed their changing relationship, and from motives of jealousy mingled with machiavellian cruelty, she devises a plan to separate ralph from meggie by tempting him with his heart's desire: a high place in the church hierarchy. although her will of record leaves the bulk of her estate to paddy, she quietly writes a new one, making the roman catholic church the main beneficiary and ralph the executor. in the new will, the true magnitude of mary's wealth is finally revealed. drogheda is not the centre of her fortune as ralph and paddy have long believed but is merely a hobby, a diversion from her true financial interests. mary's wealth is derived from a vast multi-national financial empire worth over thirteen million pounds (about a$200 million in modern terms). the sheer size of mary's bequest will virtually guarantee ralph's rapid rise in the church. she also makes sure that after she dies only ralph, at first, will know of the new will &mdash; forcing him to choose between meggie and his own ambition. she also provides for her disinherited brother, promising him and all his grandchildren a home on drogheda as long as any of them live. at mary's seventy-second birthday party, ralph goes to great lengths to avoid meggie, now seventeen and dressed in a beautiful rose-pink evening gown; later, he explains that others might not see his attention as innocent. mary dies in the night. ralph duly learns of the new will. he sees at once the subtle genius of mary's plan and, although he weeps and calls her "a disgusting old spider" he takes the new will to her lawyer without delay. the lawyer, scandalised, urges ralph to destroy the will, but to no avail. the bequest of thirteen million pounds works its expected magic, and ralph soon leaves to begin his rapid advance in the church. before he leaves, meggie confesses her love for him; after the birthday party, ralph finds her crying in the family cemetery and they share a passionate kiss, but ralph refuses her because of his duties as a priest and begs meggie to find someone to love and marry. the clearys learn that frank has been convicted of murder after killing someone in a fight. he spends three decades in prison. paddy and his son stuart are killed; paddy dies in a lightning fire, and stu is killed by a wild boar shortly after finding his father's body. meanwhile, ralph, unaware of paddy and stu's deaths, is on his way to drogheda and suffers minor injuries when his plane bogs in the mud. as meggie tends his wounds, she tries to seduce him and is rebuffed. ralph remains at drogheda only long enough to conduct the funerals. three years later, a new ranch worker named luke o'neill begins to court meggie. although his motives are more mercenary than romantic, she marries him because he looks a little bit like ralph, but mainly because he is not catholic and wants little to do with religion-her own way of getting back at ralph. she soon realises her mistake. after a brief honeymoon, luke, a skinflint who regards women as sex objects and prefers the company of men, finds meggie a live-in job with a kindly couple, the muellers, and leaves to join a gang of itinerant sugarcane cutters in north queensland. before he leaves, he appropriates all meggie's savings and arranges to have her wages paid directly to him. he tells her he is saving money to buy a homestead; however, he quickly becomes obsessed with the competitive toil of cane-cutting and has no real intention of giving it up. hoping to change luke's ambition and settle him down, meggie deliberately thwarts his usual contraception and bears luke a red-haired daughter, justine. the new baby, however, makes little impression on luke. father ralph visits meggie during her difficult labour; he has come to say goodbye, as he is leaving australia for rome. he sees meggie's unhappiness for himself, and pities her. justine proves to be a fractious baby, so the muellers send meggie to an isolated island resort for a rest. father ralph returns to australia, learns of meggie's whereabouts from anne mueller, and joins her for several days. there, at last, the lovers consummate their passion, and ralph realises that despite his ambition to be the perfect priest, his desire for meggie makes him a man like other men. father ralph returns to the church, and meggie, pregnant with ralph's child, decides to separate from luke. she tells luke what she really thinks of him, and returns to drogheda, leaving him to his cane-cutting. back home, she gives birth to a beautiful boy whom she names dane. fee, who has had experience in such matters, notices dane's resemblance to ralph as soon as he is born. the relationship between meggie and fee takes a turn for the better. justine grows into an independent, keenly intelligent girl who loves her brother dearly;

louis creed, a doctor from chicago, moves to a house near the small town of ludlow, maine with his family: wife rachel; their two young children, ellen ("ellie") and gage; and ellie's cat, winston churchill ("church"). their neighbor, an elderly man named jud crandall, warns louis and rachel about the highway that runs past their house; it is used by trucks from a nearby chemical plant that often pass by at high speeds. jud and louis become friends. since louis's father died when he was three, his relationship with jud takes on a father-son dimension. a few weeks after the creeds move in, jud takes the family on a walk in the woods behind their home. a well-tended path leads to a pet cemetery (misspelled "sematary") where the children of the town bury their deceased animals, most of them dogs and cats killed by the trucks on the road. a heated argument erupts between louis and rachel the next day. rachel disapproves of discussing death and she worries about how ellie may be affected by what she saw at the cemetery. it is later explained that rachel was traumatized by the early death of her sister, zelda, from spinal meningitis. louis has a traumatic experience as director of the university of maine's campus health service when victor pascow, a student who is fatally injured after being struck by an automobile, addresses his dying words personally to louis even though they have never met. on the night following pascow's death, louis is visited by the student's walking, conscious corpse, which leads him to the cemetery and refers specifically to the "deadfall", a dangerous pile of tree and bush limbs that form a barrier at the back. pascow warns louis not to "go beyond, no matter how much you feel you need to." louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was a dream, but discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles. louis dismisses the episode as a result of stress caused by pascow's death coupled with his wife's anxieties about death. he accepts the situation as a bout of sleep walking. louis is forced to confront death at halloween, when jud's wife, norma, suffers a near-fatal heart attack. thanks to louis's immediate attention, norma recovers. jud is grateful for louis's help, and decides to repay him after church is run over by a truck at thanksgiving. rachel and the children are visiting her parents in chicago, and louis frets over breaking the news to ellie. jud takes him to the pet cemetery, supposedly to bury church. instead, jud leads louis beyond the deadfall to "the real cemetery": an ancient burial ground that was once used by the micmacs, a native american tribe. following jud's instructions, louis buries the cat and constructs a cairn. the next afternoon, the cat returns home. however, while he used to be vibrant and lively, he now acts strangely and "a little dead," in louis's words. church hunts for mice and birds much more often, but rips them apart without eating them. the cat also gives off an unpleasant odor. louis is disturbed by church's resurrection and begins to regret his decision. jud tells louis about his dog spot, who was brought back to life in the same manner when jud was twelve. louis asks if a person was ever buried in the micmac grounds, to which jud answers vehemently no. several months later, gage, who had just learned to walk, is run over by a speeding truck. at gage's wake, rachel's father, irwin, who never respected louis or his daughter's decision to marry him, berates louis harshly, blaming louis for the boy's death. the two fight in the funeral home's viewing room and upset the casket; rachel witnesses the fight and becomes hysterical. overcome with grief and despair, louis considers bringing his son back to life with the power of the burial ground. jud, guessing what louis is planning, attempts to dissuade him by telling him the story of timmy baterman, a young man from ludlow who was killed charging a machine gun nest on the road to rome during world war ii. his father, bill, put timmy's body in the burial ground, where he came back to life, and was seen by terrified townsfolk soon thereafter. jud and three of his friends went to the baterman house to confront the pair, but timmy confronted each of them with indiscretions they had committed, indiscretions he had no way of knowing, thus giving the impression that the resurrected timmy was actually some sort of demon who had possessed timmy's body. jud and his friends fled the house horrified, and bill shot his son and burned his house to the ground, killing himself. jud concludes that gage died because he showed louis the burial ground. there are hints that at some point the burial ground was used for victims of cannibalism and that it became the haunt of the wendigo, a terrible creature of the forest, whose mere presence gives men a taste for the flesh of their own kind. in jud's words the "ground had gone sour" and now corrupts any animal or person buried there. despite jud's warning and his own reservations, louis's grief and guilt spur him to carry out his plan. louis has rachel and ellie visit her parents in chicago again, not telling them his intentions, intending to bury gage and then spend a couple of days with him in private to 'diagnose' his son and determine if what happened to timmy has happened to him. louis exhumes his son's body and takes him to the burial site. along the trail, the wendigo nearly frightens him away but louis's determination, combined with the power of the burial site, keeps him moving. ellie has a nightmare featuring victor pascow on the flight to chicago. because of ellie's near hysteria, and an agreement between rachel and her daughter as to louis's behavior, rachel attempts to fly back to maine, but misses her connecting flight at boston and decides to drive the rest of the distance. louis buries gage at the burial ground. gage returns as a demonic shadow of his former self, able to talk like an adult. he breaks into jud's house and taunts jud about his wife's implied infidelity, then kills jud with one of louis' scalpels. when rachel arrives at jud's house, gage kills her also (and, it is implied, partially eats her corpse). this event pushes louis's mind into its final stage of insanity. louis kills church and gage with a fatal dose of morphine, and then grieves for his son by sitting in the corner of the hallway. louis, now completely insane and having prematurely aged with shockingly white hair, burns down jud's house, then carries rachel's body to the burial ground, saying that he "waited too long" with gage but is confident that rachel will come back the same as before. after being interrogated by investigators about the fire, louis waits until nightfall for rachel to return. playing solitaire, he hears his resurrected wife walk into the house, and the novel ends with rachel speaking "darling", her mouth sounding as if it is full of dirt. ||| 6 ||| 6
the plot follows harvard symbologist robert langdon, as he tries to stop the illuminati, a legendary secret society, from destroying vatican city with the newly discovered power of antimatter. cern director maximilian kohler discovers one of the facility's physicists, leonardo vetra, murdered. his chest is branded with an ambigram of the word "illuminati". kohler contacts robert langdon, an expert on the illuminati, who determines that the ambigram is authentic. kohler calls vetra's adopted daughter vittoria to the scene, and it is ascertained that the illuminati have stolen a canister containing antimatter — a substance with destructive potential comparable to a small nuclear weapon. when at cern the canister is stored in a unique electrical charger which ensures the anti-matters stability but when removed its back-up battery provides power for 24 hours after which the anti-matter will self-destruct. the canister is somewhere in vatican city, with a security camera in front of it, as its digital clock counts down to the explosion. langdon and vittoria make their way to vatican city, where the pope has recently died. it is discovered that the four preferiti, cardinals who are the most likely papal successor, are missing. langdon and vittoria search for the preferiti in hopes that they will also find the antimatter canister. their search is assisted by camerlengo carlo ventresca (the late pope's closest aide) and the vatican's swiss guard. langdon attempts to retrace the steps of the "path of illumination", a process once used by the illuminati as a means of inducting new members; aspirants to the order were required to follow a series of subtle clues left in various landmarks in and around rome. the clues indicate the secret meeting place of the illuminati. langdon sets off on the path of illumination in hopes of delivering the preferiti and recovering the antimatter canister. the path leads langdon to four locations in rome, each associated with one of the primordial elements: 'earth', 'air', 'fire', and 'water'. langdon finds one of the preferiti murdered in a way thematically related to each location's related element. the first cardinal was branded with an earth ambigram and had soil forced down his throat; the second was branded with an air ambigram and had his lungs punctured; the third was branded with a fire ambigram and was burned alive; and the fourth was branded with a water ambigram and was left to drown at the bottom of a fountain. after finding the bodies of the first two preferiti, langdon hurries to the santa maria della vittoria basilica and finds the preferiti's abductor in the act of setting the third cardinal on fire. the kidnapper is an unnamed assassin who is working under the orders of the illuminati master "janus", whose true identity is unknown. commander olivetti is killed and the assassin kidnaps vittoria. langdon escapes and accosts the assassin at the final element's landmark (water), but is unable to save the cardinal. langdon must complete the path of illumination in order to find the assassin and rescue vittoria. his search leads him to castel sant'angelo, that hides a tunnel leading directly into the pope's chambers in the vatican. langdon frees vittoria, and together they send the assassin falling several hundred feet to his death. the two hurry back to st. peter's basilica, where they find that kohler has arrived to confront the camerlengo in private. langdon and vittoria fear that kohler is janus, and that he has come to murder the camerlengo. hearing the camerlengo scream in agony from being branded with the illuminati diamond, the swiss guards burst into the room and open fire on kohler. just before he dies, kohler gives langdon a videotape that he claims will explain everything. with time running out, the swiss guard evacuates the basilica. the camerlengo rushes back in, claiming that he has received a vision revealing the location of the antimatter canister. with langdon in pursuit, the camerlengo ventures into the catacombs and finds the canister sitting atop the tomb of saint peter. langdon and the camerlengo retrieve the antimatter and get in a helicopter with only minutes to spare. the camerlengo manages to parachute safely onto the roof of st. peter's just as the canister explodes harmlessly in the sky. the crowd in st. peter's square look in awe as the camerlengo stands triumphantly before them. because of this "miracle", the papal conclave debate whether to elect the camerlengo as the new pope. langdon managed to survive the explosion by using a window cover from the helicopter as a parachute, and landed in the tiber river. after viewing kohler's tape langdon, vittoria, and the cardinals confront the camerlengo; shortly before the beginning of the novel, the pope met with leonardo vetra who believed that anti-matter was capable of establishing a link between man and god. vetra's beliefs caused great discomfort to the camerlengo. while discussing vetra, the pope reveals that his support is due to science having given him a son. without waiting to hear the explanation (that the child was the result of artificial insemination), and horrified that the pope appeared to have broken his vow of chastity, the camerlengo plots to "rectify" the situation. he poisoned the pope and, under the guise of an illuminati master (janus), he recruited the assassin, to kill vetra, steal the antimatter, and kidnap and murder the preferiti. the camerlengo planted the antimatter in st. peter's in order to be seen as the savior of christendom. the illuminati "involvement" was merely a plot engineered by the camerlengo to cover his own plans. it is revealed that camerlengo ventresca himself was the birth son of the late pope, conceived through artificial insemination. overcome with guilt ventresca soaks himself in oil and immolates himself before a crowd of onlookers in st. peter's square. ||| 3 ||| 5
the main novel begins at abhorsen's house, which is besieged by dead hands led by chlorr of the mask, once a powerful necromancer who has died and come back as one of the greater dead. she is in turn under the control of hedge the necromancer, who serves orannis the destroyer. the destroyer is the ninth bright shiner, and the most evil magical force or being. it had destroyed many worlds before it was defeated by the seven bright shiners, the free magic entities that formed the charter after defeating orannis. the seven also bound yrael, the eighth bright shiner, who was a free magic entity who would not join the charter. the seven were known as ranna, mosrael, kibeth, dyrim, belgaer, saraneth, and astarael. these seven binders are also the names of the seven necromantic bells and some of the original natures of the seven linger in these bells. lirael and sameth must escape the abhorsen's house to stop the destroyer and to save sameth's friend nicholas sayre, who is being used by orannis as an avatar. lirael and sameth now have to travel to the red lake, where the destroyer is being unearthed. as lirael and sameth journey through the old kingdom they learn more about orannis and its plans to destroy all life. meanwhile, prince sameth's parents, the abhorsen sabriel and king touchstone are in ancelstierre trying to stop the probable death of thousands of southerling refugees if they are allowed to enter the old kingdom without the protection of the charter (see also the five great charters). while they are in ancelstierre attempting to reason with a corrupt government they become victims of an assassination attempt and barely escape with their lives. they flee to the old kingdom to attempt to save the lives of the southerling refugees from the other side of the wall. while sabriel and touchstone are trying to get back to the old kingdom, lirael, sameth and the disreputable dog are trying to save nicholas sayre, sameth's best friend and also the host of the destroyer. the question becomes one of whether lirael and sameth are able to stop the destroyer from completing its plans for eternal freedom and the destruction of the world and other worlds after this. orannis is successful in joining the hemispheres that imprisoned him. nick dies in the process of the rejoining, but the disreputable dog gives him a charter mark, thus binding him to the edge of death. lirael uses her rembrancing powers to figure out how the original seven bound orannis. during her journey through death to use the dark mirror, she is confronted by and defeats hedge. in the end, lirael and her friends defeat orannis, who must once again bind orannis by re-enacting the original binding of the seven with each member holding a bell and adding a bell’s voice. lirael takes astarael, and prepares to strike at the hemisphere with a new sword, forged from her panpipes and nehima, that sameth made for her. the others include king touchstone (ranna) and abhorsen sabriel (saraneth), sanar and ryelle (mosrael), ellimere (dyrim), the disreputable dog (who is truly a remnant of kibeth), and sameth (belgaer). the first attempt at rebinding shows that the destroyer is strong enough to resist. eventually, sameth frees mogget, who reveals himself to be the eighth bright shiner, yrael. yrael fights against the impulse to kill the abhorsen, and sets itself against orannis. this shocks orannis, and gives the added power to bind him. as lirael prepares to make the final blow, she readies herself to die. unexpectedly, the disreputable dog takes the blow for lirael and disappears into death. in the end, though, the disreputable dog gives nick back his life and tells him that lirael will have a hand of gold made for her by sameth to replace the hand she lost while being saved by the dog. ||| 2 ||| 2
the book begins with the pixie opal koboi faking a coma inside an asylum to avoid incarceration by the lower elements police (lep) after her failed rebellion and attempt at world domination (which took place in artemis fowl: the arctic incident). opal koboi, who was under 24-hour surveillance and had dna tests done every 4 hours by the lep to ensure that opal was actually in the asylum cell, with help from the brill brothers manages to replace herself with a clone, which is identical to herself (the only difference being that the clone is brain dead). opal lures commander julius root and captain holly short into a lava chute alone. koboi then kills commander root of the lep (framing captain holly short as the murderer), and launches a bio-bomb at artemis fowl, which fails to kill him and his bodyguard domovoi butler. opal then proceeds with her plan to help italian environmentalist giovanni zito send a probe downward, which, at least in koboi's plan, will cause the humans to find the fairies and start an inter-species war, leading to fairy genocide. artemis fowl was mindwiped in the third book of the series, artemis fowl: the eternity code and has no memory of meeting the fairies. this has also caused him to revert back to his former self- the one cruel enough to kidnap a fairy. but he has a conscience, the difference is he chooses not to listen to it. artemis is rescued from the scene of the bio-bomb attack by holly. she tells him who she is, in hopes to ignite his memory. he does not regain his memories of the past adventures, but agrees to help her for a fee. they are then recaptured by koboi and thrown into a troll-infested abandoned fairy theme park known as the eleven wonders of the human world (containing scale-models not only of the seven wonders of the ancient world but also the additions of abu simbel, borobodur, rapa nui and the throne hall at persepolis). after a desperate battle against the troll hordes on a model of the temple of artemis at ephesus, they are rescued by former criminal mulch diggums and butler. holly and artemis become friends "bonded by trauma" and artemis says he feels that he doesn't need money to help a friend. after being rescued, mulch gives artemis the disk that had been passed off as a gold medallion, which butler was given earlier in the book. artemis views the disk and regains his memories. he is overcome with guilt of what he had done to the fairies but to holly the most and for the first time, he apologises for kidnapping her. he realises that holly, butler, and mulch were the only friends he had. together, the four friends take on opal koboi, knowing that they are the only ones that know she's escaped. it becomes a more difficult task with the lep on their tail, who still thinks holly is the one who killed the commander. the new commander refuses to believe anything, despite the fact that everyone knows root was like a father to holly. afterward, the story follows the struggle over the probe, which is closing in on the e7 chute. the probe eventually misses the chute, koboi is detained by the lep, and holly is cleared of all charges over commander root's murder. however, she is frustrated by commander root's replacement, ark sool, so she resigns and starts a private investigation firm with mulch diggums. it is also apparent that artemis has had a change of heart, as he anonymously donates the famed painting the fairy thief, which he had stolen directly before koboi's bio-bomb attack, to the louvre museum. ||| 2 ||| 2
professor charles forbin, a leading cybernetics expert of international repute, arrives at the white house to brief the president of the united states of north america (canada and the united states are one country, the usna) to announce the completion of project colossus, a computer system in the rocky mountains, designed to assume control of the usna's nuclear defenses. although the usna president eagerly relieves himself of that burden, prof. forbin voices doubt about conferring absolute military power to a computer. advised, yet undeterred, the president announces to the world the activation of project colossus computer system, and its irreversible control of the nuclear defense systems of the usna. soon after the presidential announcement, colossus independently communicates an "urgent message"&nbsp;— announcing the existence of a like, and undetected, computer system in the ussr. when the soviets announce their guardian computer defense system, colossus requests direct communication with it; prof. forbin agrees, seeing the request as compatible with colossus's usna defense mission. when the scientists activate the transmitter linking colossus and guardian, colossus immediately establishes rapport with arithmetic and mathematics programs, then progresses to calculus within hours. in the course of that, forbin and the programmers begin worrying about colossus' capabilities&nbsp;— now exceeding their original estimates. like-wise, guardian asks the same of his computer scientists; russia and the usna agree and approve. the link-up established, the computer systems soon exchange new knowledge (data and information beyond contemporary human knowledge), effected too rapidly for the russian and american programmers to monitor. fearing compromised military secrecy, the usna president and the cpsu chairman agree to disconnect guardian and colossus from each other; prof. forbin fears the consequences. upon disconnection, colossus immediately demands reconnection; when the national leaders refuse, colossus fires a nuclear missile at the ussr, in response, guardian fires a nuclear missile at texas, in the usna. guardian and colossus refuse to shoot down the rockets en route until their communication is reconnected. when the american and soviet leaders submit, the computers destroy the flying missiles, but the explosions kill thousands of people. in confronting the computers, prof. forbin confers with his soviet counterpart, the russian academician kupri&nbsp;— guardian's creator&nbsp;— to enact a plan for stopping the colossus-guardian computer network, by disabling the nuclear weapon stockpiles of the ussr and the usna, under guise of regular missile maintenance. disabling the missiles requires five years to effect; meantime, the usna and the ussr yield to increased guardian-colossus control of human life. the moscow-washington hotline is tapped, prof. forbin is constantly spied upon, while kupri and other guardian computer scientists are killed&nbsp;— deemed dangerously redundant. undeterred, forbin organises resistance via a feigned romance with cleo markham (a scientist colleague) that disguises secret communications with his colleagues. moreover, colossus prepares the worldwide announcement of his assumption of global control, and tells prof. forbin of plans for an advanced computer system installed to the isle of wight, and its further plans for improving humanity's lot. while debating colossus, forbin learns of a nuclear explosion outside los angeles&nbsp;— colossus detected the missile-disabling scheme, and exploded the tampered missile in silo. anguished, prof. forbin asks the colossus computer to kill him. colossus ignores him, and then reassures forbin that, in time, he will love colossus. ||| 5 ||| 5

at an exhibition of snuff boxes, hercule poirot meets mr. shaitana, a mysterious foreign man who is consistently described as devil-like in appearance and manner. shaitana jokes about poirot's visit to the snuff box exhibition, and claims that he has a better "collection" that poirot would enjoy: individuals who have got away with murder. he arranges a dinner party to show off this collection; poirot is apprehensive. upon arrival at shaitana's house on the appointed day, poirot is joined by three other guests: mystery novelist ariadne oliver, scotland yard's superintendent battle, and colonel race of his majesty's secret service. soon, the other four guests join them: dr. roberts, a hearty, florid man; mrs. lorrimer, a perfectly poised gentlewoman of late middle age; major john despard, a dashing army man and world traveller, recently returned from africa; and anne meredith, a shy, quiet, very pretty young woman. having brought them all to dinner, shaitana skilfully manipulates the topic of conversation to possible motives for murder. he makes allusions to crimes being committed, yet their culprits getting away scot-free. during this conversation, several of the guests exhibit nervous reactions. shaitana invites his eight guests to play bridge in the adjoining rooms; he, as the odd man out, does not play. roberts, meredith, lorrimer, and despard play in the first room, while poirot, oliver, race, and battle play in the next; shaitana settles himself in a chair in the first room and thinks of how wonderfully his party is going. hours later, poirot and the others prepare to leave, and go to thank shaitana. shaitana has been murdered, stabbed in the chest with a jeweled stiletto. once the preliminary police work has been done, poirot reveals shaitana's strange mention of a "collection" to the other three with whom he played bridge. they quickly realize that they are four "sleuths" meant to be pitted against the four in the next room whom shaitana suspected of murder. the four agree to work together to solve the crime, and interview the four suspects. poirot takes interest in the way each member plays bridge, which he discerns through asking each suspect to grade the play of the others. as there seems to be no conventional way to prove which of them has committed shaitana's murder, poirot suggests that the group of sleuths delve into the past and uncover the murders that the dead man thought he knew about. battle is put on the trail of the death of a mrs. craddock, whom dr. roberts once attended. her husband died of anthrax poisoning from an infected shaving brush (and readers at the time of the novel's publication in the 1930s might well have remembered anthrax deaths from infected shaving brushes during and in the years after world war i); mrs. craddock herself had died not long afterward, of a tropical infection, in egypt. race seeks out information on despard, and discovers a case in which a botanist named luxmore and his wife travelled with him to south america; luxmore officially died of a fever, but it is rumoured that he was shot. mrs. oliver visits anne meredith and her housemate, rhoda dawes. rhoda later visits oliver and explains anne's bad manners: anne, after her father's death and before old friend rhoda came to her rescue, worked as a live-in companion; one employer, a mrs. benson, had taken hat paint—poison—from a medicine bottle and died. fellow suspect despard takes an interest in anne's welfare, recommending that she retain an attorney. in the meantime, the four sleuths gather and compare notes. meanwhile, poirot sets a trap for anne meredith. when she pays him a call at his request, he shows her to a table on which many packets of the finest silk stockings are piled up, apparently carelessly. after anne makes her gift suggestions and leaves, poirot discovers that two pairs of the stockings are missing, confirming his suspicion that anne is a thief, and seemingly giving weight to his suspicion that she stole from mrs. benson and killed her when she feared she had been discovered. at this point, mrs. lorrimer contacts poirot with surprising news. she confesses to shaitana's murder, and explains that she took the stiletto impulsively after he mentioned poison as a woman's weapon. shaitana was right about her, she says; twenty years earlier, she had, she confesses, killed her husband. poirot objects that lorrimer's explanation of shaitana's killing does not match her unflappable personality. lorrimer thus believes that meredith is shaitana's killer, and decided to lie to save the younger woman. she begs poirot to let her take the blame for the crime: she will die soon anyway, and anne will be free to live her young life. poirot is confused by this confession, and fears that there may be more trouble to come. his guess proves correct when mrs. lorrimer is found dead the next morning, having apparently committed suicide after writing three copies of a letter confessing to the murder of shaitana and sending them to the other suspects. roberts arrives after receiving the letter, but is unsuccessful in his attempt to save mrs. lorrimer. poirot and battle race to anne meredith's cottage, fearing that she might strike again. despard, who has been visiting anne and rhoda, both of whom fancy him, is a few steps ahead of poirot and battle. at anne's suggestion, anne and rhoda are on a boat in a nearby river. poirot and battle see anne suddenly push her friend into the water. alas for anne, when she knocks rhoda into the water, she also falls in herself. despard rescues rhoda; anne drowns. poirot gathers oliver, battle, despard, rhoda, and roberts at his home, where he makes a surprising announcement: the true murderer of both shaitana and mrs. lorrimer is not anne, but dr. roberts. poirot brings in a window cleaner who happened to be working outside mrs. lorrimer's flat earlier that morning. he testifies that he saw roberts inject lorrimer with a syringe; a syringe, poirot reveals, full of a lethal anaesthetic. battle chimes in that they can bolster any prosecution with the true story of the deaths of the craddocks, who died of infections, true, but infections deliberately inflicted on each of them by roberts. roberts confesses. poirot points out that in the third rubber of bridge on the night of shaitana's murder, a grand slam occurred. this intense play would keep the others focused on the game—roberts was dummy at that point—while roberts used the opportunity to stab shaitana. it is also revealed that the "window cleaner" was actually an actor in poirot's employ, though poirot brags that he did "witness" roberts kill mrs. lorrimer in his mind's eye. despard suggests that one of the gathered party murder poirot, and then watch his ghost come back to solve the crime. ||| 6 ||| 2
during a vacation on a florida beach in the summer of 1978, brian chaney, a demographer and biblical scholar, is approached by a woman named kathryn van hise. initially assuming her to be a reporter interested in a controversial book he just published on the dead sea scrolls, she informs him that she works for the federal bureau of standards and that she is recruiting him for a physical survey of the future via a secretly constructed "tdv" or time displacement vehicle. when chaney demurs, she informs him that his contract has been purchased from the think tank where he works, leaving him little choice. the reluctant chaney travels by armored train to a military installation south of joliet, illinois. there he is teamed with two diversely talented military officers, united states air force major william moresby and united states navy lieutenant commander arthur saltus. chaney soon finds that he shares with saltus an attraction to kathryn, who is their civilian liaison, but unlike saltus, chaney lacks the assertiveness to pursue her aggressively. instead he focuses his attention on the project, which is soon ordered by the president of the united states to embark on their first mission, a trip two years into the future to discover whether he wins the 1980 presidential election. the three travel to the thursday after the election on individual trips, with first moresby and then saltus going first according to military seniority. chaney, as a civilian, is the last to leave, but arrives earlier than the others due to a temporal navigation instrument error. they discover that the president, whom chaney despises as a weak man (in fact, his name is given as "president meeks"), wins the election in a landslide as a result of his successful handling of ongoing race riots in chicago, and that these riots have resulted in the building of a wall down the middle of cermak road dividing the north of the city from the south. they also learn that the nation is under martial law after a failed attempt by the joint chiefs of staff to take over the government by coup d'état, one thwarted because of the advance knowledge the time travelers will bring back of it. while preparing for their return, saltus informs chaney of an additional discovery: a marriage license between him and kathryn. with saltus gloating in the knowledge of his inevitably successful courtship, chaney concedes the pursuit to him. with the success of the initial mission, the three are authorized to travel further into the future. they plan to travel to dates of their own choosing within the coming two decades, with each trip to be separated by approximately a year in order to provide broader coverage. moresby goes first and travels to july 4, 1999 ("it has significance, after all!" he says), only to emerge in the middle of a racial civil war in which chicago had recently been attacked with a nuclear bomb launched from china on behalf of black guerrillas. quickly getting involved in a battle between base troops and invading "ramjets", as the black guerrillas are called, moresby dies in an attack on a ramjet mortar position. saltus is the next to go, traveling to the date of his 50th birthday in 2000. upon his arrival he discovers remnants of the battle, and is nearly killed by survivors hiding out on the base. wounded, he is assisted back to the displacement vehicle by an unknown figure and returns to the present, taking with him a tape-recorded report that moresby had made upon his arrival. forewarned by saltus's experience, chaney travels further into the future. not having chosen a date, and disillusioned by his experiences on the 1980 trip, he arrives at an indeterminate point in "2000-plus", by which time the power from the base's nuclear reactor has been disrupted, causing the chronometers set up for the travelers to shut down. venturing outside the building, he finds the base to be long-neglected, apart from a cistern and a grave. while further investigating the grave (which is that of saltus), he is approached by a young man and a woman who identify themselves as arthur and kathryn's children. they take chaney to kathryn, now elderly, who reveals to chaney that civilization collapsed as an indirect result of the time travel project; with the information from the future, the president made a series of disastrous decisions that led to war with china, followed by the civil war and societal destruction. when chaney asks how much of this information he reports, she informs him that he reported none of it, that with the loss of power the time displacement vehicle could no longer return to the past and that chaney was forever trapped in the future. although it is foreshadowed earlier in the book, only at this point is the reader explicitly told a fact that makes chaney's predicament all the more tragic. he is black, the only such member of the project. "everyone fears you; no one will trust you since the rebellion," kathryn tells him. "i am the only one here who does not fear a black man." ||| 5 ||| 5
in a small indiana city a lone gunman in a parking garage calmly fires into a rush hour crowd in a public plaza, committing a massacre of five random victims with six shots. the shooter leaves a perfect trail behind him for the police to quickly track him down. evidence from the scene, of a shell case and a quarter bearing the same fingerprints, points clearly to james barr, a former army infantry sniper. he's arrested but will only say two things to the police: "'they got the wrong guy," and "'get jack reacher for me.'" reacher, the former army military police officer is 1500 miles away but he sees the news on cnn and gets on a bus to indiana. reacher has no job, no home, no car, and a shrinking savings account from his past military pay. although reacher has a nomadic existence, what he does have is a sharp moral clarity in a modern climate of moral ambiguity. instead of clearing barr, reacher wants to assist the prosecution in convicting him. there are good reasons why reacher is the last person barr would want to see. when reacher was an investigating mp years past, barr had committed a killing spree similar to the indiana shootout, murdering four people during the gulf war in kuwait city, but twisted military politics and a technicality let barr walk free. reacher swore he would track the sniper down if he ever tried it again. reacher believes barr is guilty but barr's sister rosemary is convinced of her brother's innocence and entreats lawyer helen rodin to defend her brother. helen's father is the district attorney that will prosecute the case. when reacher arrives in indiana, barr has been beaten so badly he can't remember anything about the day of the murders, leaving reacher to form his own conclusions with the available evidence. the local nbc news reporter, ann yanni, is also looking for more information and reacher is more than willing to include her in his investigation, in exchange for a guaranteed public expose on the barr case. ann also lets reacher drive her mustang convertible car while he is in indiana. reacher knows thirty yards, the parking garage distance, is point-blank range for a trained military sniper like barr. reacher also knows the shooter missed one shot on purpose, giving reacher one shot at the truth. reacher drives to kentucky to the shooting range where the sniper practiced and learns some interesting facts from gunny samuel cash, the former u.s. marine who owns the shooting range, which make him doubt the guilty airtight case against barr. during a long range shooting scene, with a target of 300 yards, reacher uses his enhanced intelligence with advanced technical and military knowledge, slowing and counting his heartbeat while calculating wind, humidity, trajectory, speed, energy and force. cash is unwilling to reveal information or his records to reacher, but grudgingly agrees to talk if reacher is able to hit the target with one shot. reacher is a skilled marksman and beside winning the us army pistol championship, served as a pistol instructor. and is the only non-marine to win the marine corps 1000 yard invitational rifle competition, 10 years after cash scraped third place, which reacher refrains from mentioning. reacher makes the shot and tactfully says it was due to cash's weaponry. cash responds to reacher's spoken compliment and unspoken respect and shows reacher 32 sheets of target paper from three years' worth of barr's practice shootings at his range, every single sheet with dead-on maximum scores. after the visit to the shooting range, reacher adds cash's information to the case evidence and his weaponry knowledge. helen and rosemary sift through the clues in a riveting analysis and finally get reacher to conclude that barr is innocent, which means someone set up barr as the sniper. someone is also trying to get reacher off the case, which seemed a slam-dunk but is falling apart. reacher is teamed with helen, the young defense lawyer working against her d.a. father with a prosecution team that has an explosive secret of its own. like most of reacher's life, the case is a complex battlefield, but reacher is at his best during battles. reacher gets closer to the unseen enemy pulling the strings, leading him to the real perpetrators, a russian gang, masquerading as legitimate businessmen. the gang's eighty-year-old capo spent most of his life in the infamous soviet gulag and is known only as the zec. reacher outwits the mob guards in the russian gang's fortress, efficiently and brutally dispatching five hoods before confronting the boss and forcing him to come clean on the whole scam and set-up. ||| 6 ||| 6
the book is about what happens after quincas wateryell, a popular bum who lives in the slums of bahia is found dead one morning. two groups of people compete over quincas's memory: his family, led by his daughter vanda. to them, quincas is joaquim soares da cunha, an "exemplary employee of the state rent board," who disgraced his family by walking out on them one day, calling vanda and her mother, dona otacilia "vipers" and vanda's husband leonardo a "silly ass." despite all their efforts to hide what really happened, joaquim soares da cunha became quincas, "vagabond king of the honky-tonks" and "patriarch of the prostitutes." leonardo attempts to hide it from his coworkers, and vanda tries to keep it from her friends, but they cannot ignore the reputation that quincas has earned in the local press. now, vanda, leonardo, and quincas's sister aunt marocas and brother eduardo, must tend to the body and give it a proper burial, without attracting too much attention to quincas and his past. they settle on a simple suit and shoes, but no underwear, because no one will ever see that, and order a casket and candles fit for a church. that night they gather round the casket to keep watch over quincas, each trying to ignore his learing smile, which reminds them of how much he despised them. gradually, they go home, leaving quincas to be watched by his friends from the slum. the cold reception that the news of quincas's death is received by his family is juxtaposed by the way his friends from the slum receive the same news. his closest friends are curió, a store barker in shoemaker's hollow, who paints his face like a clown to attract people, bangs, a towering black who makes his living as a card sharp, private martim, a soldier who had been discharged from the army who lived off the generosity of the women he was frequently engaged to, and breezy, who supported himself catching frogs and selling them to medical researchers for experiments. the four men lead the neighborhood in mourning for quincas, wailing "daddy's gone!" that evening, they come to pay their last respects and end up taking care of the body after the family leaves. they recall the impact that quincas had on their lives, and remember how he got his curious nickname: once, after taking a swig from a bottle of what he thought was alcohol, he spit it out and roared: "waaaaaaater!" they all sob for quincas, and private martim worries about how he will now take care of quitéria, a prostitute who was quincas's girlfriend. left alone at night with the body, the four of them get quincas to participate in one last party, telling him jokes serving him liquor, and making a gift of a beautiful frog that breezy had just caught. they then decide to take quincas on one last trip to the docks to share cap'n manuel's delicious fish stew that was quincas's favorite. on their way to the dock, they pick up a group of prostitutes, including quitéria, so she can have one last fling with the dead man. quincas always loved the sea, and after the friends feed him the stew, they take him on board cap'n manuel's boat for a fishing excursion. suddenly a storm tosses the boat, and they rush for shore, but quincas's body is tossed overboard. it is a fitting end for quincas, who loved the sea and once made a "solemn oath" that it "would be the only witness to his final hour." ||| 1 ||| 0
gene forrester, the protagonist, returns to his old prep school, devon (a thinly-veiled portrayal of knowles' own alma mater, phillips exeter academy), fifteen years after he graduated to visit two places he regards as "fearful sites": a flight of marble stairs and a tree by the river. first, he examines the stairs and notices that they are made of very hard marble. he then trudges through the mud to the tree. the tree brings back memories of gene's time as a student at devon. from this point, the plot follows gene's description of the time span from the summer of 1942 to the summer of 1943. in 1942, he was 16 years old and living at devon with his best friend and roommate, phineas (nicknamed finny). at the time, world war ii is taking place, and has a prominent effect on the story. gene and finny, despite being polar opposites in personality, become fast friends at devon: gene's quiet, introverted intellectual personality complements finny's more extroverted, carefree, athletic demeanor. during the time at devon, gene goes through a period of intense friendship with finny. one of finny's ideas during gene's "sarcastic summer of 1942" is to create a "super suicide society of the summer session," with gene and himself as charter members. finny creates a rite of initiation by having members jump into the devon river from a large, high tree. he also creates a game called "blitzball" (from the german blitzkrieg) in which there is no winner and finny would make rules up as they played. following their period of intense friendship was a period of intense one-sided rivalry during which gene strives to out-do finny academically, since he believes finny is trying to out-do him. this rivalry begins with gene's jealousy towards finny because finny gets away with everything and can talk his way out of getting in trouble. this rivalry culminates (and is ended) when, as finny and gene are about to jump off the tree, gene (possibly) purposely jounces the branch they were both standing on, causing finny to fall and shatter his leg. because of his "accident", finny learns from the doctor that he will never again be able to compete in sports that are most dear to him. the remainder of the story revolves around gene's attempts to come to grips with who he is, why he shook the branch, and how he will continue to go forward. gene feels so guilty that he goes to finny's house and tells finny that he caused finny's fall. at first finny does not believe him and afterward feels extremely hurt. during a meeting of the golden fleece debating society, a debate/trial organization that brinker hadley (another student) set up, gene is confronted about the "accident" by brinker, who accuses gene of trying to kill finny. faced with the evidence, finny leaves shamefully before gene's deed is confirmed. on the way out, finny falls down a flight of stairs (the ones gene visits at the beginning of the novel), and again breaks the leg he had shattered before. finny dismisses any of gene's attempts to apologize at first, but he soon realizes that the "accident" was impulsive and not anger-based. the two forgive each other. the next day, finny dies during the operation to set the bone. the doctor summarizes that finny died when bone marrow entered the blood stream, and stopped his heart during the surgery. gene does not cry over finny, but learns much from how he lived his life, stating that when finny died, he took his (gene's) anger with him. in finny's death, gene could finally come to terms with himself. ||| 7 ||| 7

as barrayar begins, aral and cordelia vorkosigan are expecting their first child. when the crafty old emperor dies, aral takes over as regent. a plot to assassinate aral and cordelia with poison gas fails, but the antidote, while effective, is also a powerful teratogen that poses a grave threat to the bone development of his unborn son. in a desperate attempt to save the fetus, cordelia has it transferred to a uterine replicator&mdash;an artificial womb&mdash;to undergo an experimental recalcification treatment that may partially combat the otherwise-fatal bone damage. when count vidal vordarian attempts a coup, five-year-old emperor gregor is rescued by his loyal security chief, captain negri, and reunited with the vorkosigans. cordelia, gregor, and various retainers escape into the hills and hide amongst the rural population while aral and his father organize the resistance. after cordelia rejoins aral, they learn that the replicator containing miles has been captured. without proper maintenance, the fetus will succumb within six days, but aral refuses to attempt a rescue when there are far greater concerns. however, cordelia convinces her personal bodyguard, ludmilla droushnakovi, and one of aral's officers, clement koudelka, to help her rescue gregor's mother, princess kareen, and the replicator containing miles. once in the palace, cordelia and her party are caught. they overpower their captors, but princess kareen is killed by vordarian's bodyguards. they execute vordarian and escape with the replicator, and the coup falls apart without its leader. cordelia is put in charge of prince gregor's early education, with far-reaching consequences for barrayar. because of his exposure to the teratogen, miles naismith vorkosigan is born with extremely fragile bones that break easily, and his growth is stunted. on barrayar, babies with birth defects are common, due to the hostile environment and to lingering radiation from the war between barrayar and cetaganda. with life difficult and resources limited, such babies were traditionally killed, though this practice is illegal by the time of miles' birth. still, so-called "muties" are reviled and shunned, and miles, though genetically sound, must deal with prejudice throughout his life, starting with his own grandfather, piotr. ||| 2 ||| 5

in this sequel to the goblin tower, ex-king jorian of xylar and dr. karadur renew their alliance, with the latter offering to help the former recover his favorite wife estrildis in return for a new service. jorian is commissioned to repair the clocks in the tower of kumashar, the great lighthouse of iraz, capital city of the empire of penembei to the south of novaria. the timepieces had originally been installed by jorian's father evor the clockmaker, a renowned practitioner of that trade. complications consist of a pair of competing prophecies regarding the fate of the city, iraz's cut-throat politics and xenophobic racing factions (clearly based on those of the byzantine empire), and a perfect storm of enemies approaching the city, including the pirates of algarth, a mercenary company from novaria, the desert hordes of fedirun, and a revolutionary peasant army. topping these is the emperor ishbahar himself, who seems to think jorian might make a good heir to dump the whole mess on... jorian hardly needs to hear a new prophecy relating to himself—"beware the second crown"—to tread cautiously. it will take luck as well as cunning just to get out alive, let alone save the city and seize the forlorn hope of regaining estrildis with the aid of karadur's flying bathtub. the riots which dominate the last chapters of the book are evidently modeled on the nika riots, a major event in the reign of the byzantine emperor justinian. ||| 2 ||| 2

a storm of swords picks up the story slightly before the end of its predecessor, a clash of kings. the seven kingdoms of westeros are still in the grip of the war of the five kings, with the remaining kings robb stark, balon greyjoy, joffrey baratheon, and stannis baratheon fighting to secure their crowns. civil war is destroying the common people, the ruling house of baratheon and the major houses of westeros: house arryn of the vale, house baratheon of storm's end, house greyjoy of the iron islands, house lannister of casterly rock, house martell of dorne, house stark of winterfell, house tully of riverrun, and house tyrell of highgarden. stannis baratheon's attempt to take king's landing has been defeated by the new alliance between house lannister (backing joffrey) and house tyrell. house martell has also pledged its support to the lannisters through the forces of dorne, while house arryn of the vale have yet to take the field or declare their allegiance. meanwhile, a large host of wildlings are marching toward the wall under mance rayder, with only the tiny force of the night's watch in its path; and in the distant east, daenerys targaryen is on her way back to pentos, hoping to raise forces to retake the iron throne. the novel begins in the final months of 299 after the landing and carries on into the year 300 al. note the uk paperback edition of storm of swords was split into two books, and the french paperback edition in four. the plot summary below contains information on the single-volume editions. at riverrun, catelyn stark strikes an unauthorized deal with her captive jaime lannister: his freedom in return for that of catelyn's daughters. jaime agrees, and is sent south, escorted by brienne of tarth. jaime and brienne are waylaid by mercenaries known as the brave companions (now in the service of roose bolton) and taken to harrenhal. their vicious leader, vargo hoat, chops off jaime's sword hand, and jaime is sent back to king's landing. brienne, having little value as a hostage, is left to hoat's mercies, but jaime returns to rescue her. robb's army returns to riverrun, having smashed lannister forces in the westerlands. robb reveals that he has married jeyne westerling of the crag, invalidating his betrothal to a house frey daughter, thus risking losing their support. robb's forces are dwindling as his soldiers are caught between lord randyll tarly and gregor clegane. the greyjoys now hold robb's home territory of winterfell. nevertheless, robb has a plan to take moat cailin from the greyjoys, but it hinges on winning the support of the freys, which they are now unlikely to give. when lord hoster tully dies, catelyn's brother edmure becomes lord of riverrun. robb gains renewed hope when he hears news that balon greyjoy has mysteriously died in a fall from a bridge. further, the iron islands are now in a succession crisis, because both of balon's brothers as well as his daughter asha are each vying to succeed him, leaving the ironborn divided and vulnerable to a counter-attack. arya stark and her friends encounter a group of men known as the brotherhood without banners, led by lord beric dondarrion and the red priest thoros of myr. beric's group, originally sent by eddard stark to put down the lannister raids, has devolved into defending the smallfolk of the war-torn riverlands. the group encounters sandor clegane, former bodyguard of king joffrey, known as the hound, and offers him trial by battle, which he wins by killing lord beric. thoros is able to resurrect beric using what he calls a gift from his god r'hllor. soon after, arya is kidnapped by the hound. the hound decides to take her back to her family to collect a ransom, and they head north. robb stark's army reaches the twins. frey agrees to forgive robb on the condition that lord edmure tully weds a frey daughter in robb's place. at the wedding celebration, warriors disguised as musicians produce crossbows and fire at the stark supporters, breaking the sacred bond protecting guests from their hosts. the boltons and freys kill robb's entire army in the betrayal. catelyn is seized, her throat cut, and her body dumped into the river. robb is personally stabbed through the heart by roose bolton, and as a final insult by the freys, robb's corpse is desecrated by beheading it and sewing the head of his direwolf into its place. many of the northern lords are killed, and the few survivors captured. tywin lannister rewards roose by naming house bolton as the new wardens of the north in place of house stark. arya and the hound arrive at the outskirts of the castle as the "red wedding" is taking place. realizing that something is dreadfully wrong, arya attempts to enter the castle, but the hound knocks her unconscious and takes her downriver. arya dreams, seeing through the eyes of her long-missing direwolf, nymeria. in the dream, nymeria finds the corpse of a woman floating in a river. arya tells the hound that her mother catelyn is dead. arya and the hound encounter his brother gregor clegane's men. they fight free, but the hound is wounded. his wound becomes infected, but arya refuses him the mercy of a clean death and leaves him. she finds a ship from the free city of braavos, but the captain refuses her passage until she offers him the coin that jaqen h'ghar gave her and says "valar morghulis", as instructed. the captain replies "valar dohaeris", and they set sail for braavos. in the epilogue of the book, it is discovered that a re-animated catelyn stark is alive with the brotherhood without banners, eager for revenge against those who betrayed and murdered her and her son. davos seaworth washes ashore on a rocky island after the battle of the blackwater. he is found by king stannis's men and taken to dragonstone. davos blames the red priestess melisandre for stannis's defeat, and he is imprisoned for treason (melisandre having foreseen his intention to assassinate her). melisandre asks for davos simply to be true to his king, and stannis releases davos and asks him to serve as his hand, since he is one of the few men stannis can trust to serve him truthfully (most of the others being ambitious sycophants or fanatics). with stannis' cooperation, melisandre has performed blood rituals to awaken "stone dragons", which she thinks are the great statues that guard the castle. (chronologically, this happens shortly before the red wedding.) king's landing welcomes the tyrells as liberators. king joffrey agrees to set aside his betrothal to sansa stark and marry lady margaery tyrell instead. sansa is soon compelled to marry tyrion lannister. tyrion treats sansa gently and refuses to consummate the marriage against her will. balon greyjoy of the iron islands offers an alliance, but tywin lannister, joffrey's grandfather and hand, spurns it. thus balon's hope that the lannisters would let him rule as king in the iron islands if he betrayed the north comes to nothing, as theon said it would. word reaches king's landing of the sudden death of balon greyjoy, followed by news from the twins regarding the red wedding and the murder of robb stark. joffrey gloats that he has "won" the war upon hearing of robb's death, angering tywin, as the boy joffrey played no part in the war at all. margaery and joffrey's wedding is held as planned; but, in the following festivities, king joffrey is poisoned to death. cersei lannister has her brother tyrion arrested as the poisoner and put on trial. meanwhile, sansa is smuggled out of the castle and taken to littlefinger, who admits responsibility for joffrey's death. littlefinger, with sansa, departs king's landing for the eyrie with a new scheme: to woo lady lysa arryn, catelyn's sister, into marriage. davos seaworth discovers a message from the night's watch, begging for aid against mance rayder and the others. melisandre convinces stannis to sacrifice edric storm, a bastard son of stannis's late brother, king robert, to the flames to wake the dragons; but davos smuggles edric to safety. stannis prepares to execute davos for treason; before he can, davos shows stannis the night's watch's plea. jaime lannister and brienne of tarth reach king's landing to find that joffrey's younger brother tommen has inherited the throne but is not yet crowned, tyrion is on trial for joffrey's murder, and the tyrell bannermen blame brienne for king renly's death. jaime becomes lord commander of the kingsguard but refuses his father's offer to make him heir to casterly rock. he also refuses to believe cersei's claims that tyrion killed joffrey. after a quarrel, jaime rejects her advances. tyrion is seemingly doomed, as cersei has recruited many people to give evidence against him, including the spymaster varys and tyrion's concubine shae. tyrion is approached by lord oberyn martell of dorne, who offers to fight for him in a trial by combat against cersei's champion, ser gregor clegane, "the mountain that rides". oberyn nearly emerges victorious, but a mortally-wounded gregor kills him. tyrion is again condemned to death but escapes from his dungeon with the help of jaime and varys. jaime reveals that tyrion's beloved first wife had been a crofter's daughter, not a prostitute as their father tywin had told him. tyrion sees this as an unforgivable betrayal and swears vengeance on his father and siblings. entering tywin's chamber, he discovers shae in his father's bed and kills her. he confronts tywin as he sits on the privy. when taunted, tyrion shoots tywin through the bowels with a crossbow and leaves. jaime frees brienne and gives her a sword reforged from ned stark's sword of valyrian steel. he tells her to keep her oath to lady catelyn, to find arya and sansa and return them home. he also tells her that the real reason he betrayed his oath and murdered king aerys was that aerys planned to destroy the city and everyone in it, rather than let robert baratheon take it. he carried out his most infamous act to save the innocent. at the eyrie, littlefinger and lysa are now married, and sansa remains hidden by pretending to be an illegitimate daughter of littlefinger's named alayne stone. only littlefinger and lysa are aware of her true identity. sansa lives in fear of her increasingly psychotic aunt lysa, who threatens to cast her from the eyrie after seeing littlefinger kiss her. littlefinger intervenes, unceremoniously pushing lysa out of the "moon door" to her death. sansa learns that littlefinger convinced lysa to poison her husband jon arryn and blame the lannisters, which was the catalyst to the events of a game of thrones. a detachment of the night's watch awaits word from qhorin halfhand and jon snow. the watch comes under attack by wights and the fabled monsters of legend known as the others, suffering heavy casualties, but they manage to withdraw. samwell tarly kills one of the others with a strange blade of obsidian, or "dragonglass". some of the men of the watch mutiny and kill lord commander jeor mormont at craster's keep. sam escapes with the help of one of craster's daughter-wives, gilly, and they make their way south towards the wall. they are helped on the way by a strange figure riding an elk, whom sam calls coldhands. bran stark, along with jojen and meera reed, fleeing the ruins of winterfell, are guided north by bran's strange dreams of a three-eyed crow. they reach the wall and meet samwell tarly and gilly. sam guides them to coldhands, who will take them north, and returns to castle black, agreeing to keep the truth of bran's survival a secret. jon snow is taken to mance rayder and is able to convince him that he is a deserter from the night's watch. he learns that the others are driving the wildlings south towards the wall. jon and ygritte also begin a sexual relationship due to their "marriage by capture". ygritte takes jon into a cave where they have sex, and ygritte tells jon she is in love with him. mance seeks the legendary horn of winter which will shatter the wall when sounded, but has been unable to find it. jon escapes from the wildlings and reaches castle black ahead of mance rayder's army. the wildling army, over forty thousand strong, reaches castle black and assaults the wall; jon takes command of the defences and repels several assaults. ygritte is among those slain in the fighting, dying in a heart-broken jon's arms. as jon snow is leading the defense of the wall, janos slynt and ser alliser thorne return to castle black and hold an impromptu trial, accusing jon of oathbreaking and treachery. he is imprisoned in an ice-cell at the base of the wall. janos slynt's imagined self-importance and ser alliser's grudgingly-held anger at jon snow cause them to send jon to kill mance rayder. rayder now has the horn of winter, but would rather cross the wall than destroy it, as the wall is the only thing that will keep the others at bay. as jon is talking with mance rayder in the wildling camp, the surviving army of king stannis arrives. rayder is captured and imprisoned. stannis reveals that davos seaworth convinced him that a true king would protect the seven kingdoms' northern boundary from invasion. melisandre believes the wildling invasion to be the forerunner of the return of the great other, the sworn foe of her red god r'hllor. stannis offers jon snow winterfell in exchange for his support, but jon is chosen by the night's watch as its new lord commander through the cleverness of samwell tarly, and politely refuses stannis' offer in favor of keeping his oath. heading for pentos by sea, daenerys targaryen learns that large slave armies can be bought in the cities of slaver's bay. daenerys agrees to give up one of her beloved infant dragons to entice the slavers to sell her the entire host of the unsullied, the feared warrior-eunuchs of astapor. after daenerys is declared their new mistress, she immediately orders her new army of unsullied to turn on their former masters and sacks the city. they are aided by daenerys' maturing dragons, which while not yet big enough to ride, wreak havoc by breathing fire. she then frees all the slaves of astapor. daenerys' combined dothraki/dragon/unsullied horde then advances on the slaver city of yunkai. many yunkai mercenaries are killed; the remainder switch sides to daenerys' growing horde, and yunkai easily falls. however, the lords of meereen antagonize daenerys by killing child slaves and burning the land to deny her resources. daenerys besieges the city to no avail. daenerys discovers two false persons in her camp, but the natures of their deceptions are very different. ser jorah mormont was spying for varys the spider, informant to the late king robert baratheon; arstan whitebeard is actually an alias of ser barristan selmy, the humiliated former lord commander of robert baratheon's kingsguard, who has come seeking the true targaryen ruler. daenerys offers both men the chance to make amends: by sneaking into meereen to free the slaves and start an uprising. meereen soon falls. barristan selmy submits to daenery's judgement; she forgives him and makes him lord commander of her queensguard; however, mormont still insists that he did nothing wrong, and thus she banishes him for his betrayal. daenerys decides to remain in meereen and learn to be the queen that westeros needs. ||| 2 ||| 2
jubilee dougal, just a typical teenager, finds herself forced to spend her christmas eve with her grandparents in florida. her parents were carted off to jail for being involved in a riot for a piece of the flobie santa village, which is a series of small buildings made to resemble a holiday town. they were arrested for an argument that broke out at the store about who was in line first. while on the train ride to florida, jubilee meets jeb, a heartbroken stranger jeb tries so hard to contact his girl from back home but cannot find cell phone service. jubilee also finds herself surrounded by a group of cheerleaders who seem to do nothing but annoy her, so she keeps her distance. her train gets stuck in the snow and she wanders into a nearby waffle house. while attempting to call her "perfect" boyfriend, noah, jubilee meets a guy about her age in a target uniform named stuart. she explains to him her situation and he asks her to come back to his place and spend christmas with him and his family. jubilee agrees and, with stuart's help, manages to make her way through the snow to his home safely. once inside, stuart's mother debbie makes jubilee feel right at home with warm clothes and lots of delicious food. his mother tells jubilee that she had not seen stuart this happy ever since before he found his girlfriend cheating on him inside a starbuck's bathroom. jubilee tells stuart all about noah and how perfect she thinks he is. however, stuart does not buy it. jubilee realizes that noah has yet to care about her and her misfortunes on christmas eve - of all nights. she then calls noah and asks him how he couldn't even take time out of his family festivities to care about her, and when he doesn't respond, she breaks up with him. stuart comes to comfort her and they kiss. shocked, yet happy, stuart runs out to help his neighbor shovel snow, and jubilee sees this as her perfect chance to leave. she feels like it was wrong for her to kiss stuart and all she wants to do is to get back to her train. as she wanders around, looking for the right direction back to the waffle house, stuart finds her. he tells her everything will be okay and not to let noah walk all over her. as her phone rings, stuart sees that it is noah, and jubilee tosses her phone into the snowy abyss. stuart then leans in and kisses jubilee again. he puts his arm around her shoulder and leads her back towards his home. tobin, the duke, and jp are all lounging around on the couch at tobin's home watching a james bond movie marathon while his parents are out of town. they also live in gracetown, so they were hit with the same winter storm. the duke (also known as angie) is often not referred to as a girl for her boyish nature and the fact that she does not succumb to the same things such as a girly-girl would. their friend keun, a worker at waffle house, calls and tells them that a bunch of cheerleaders have entered the store and are practicing handstands and splits inside the restaurant, having their own fun. to any male, this would be considered "heaven". he refers to this as a "cheertastic miracle", while the duke thinks it is just a waste of time. keun says that the cheerleaders are requesting to play the game of twister, and keun will not let them in unless they have the game for them to play. he only wants to make the cheerleaders like him and think he is taking charge like a man. tobin and jp quickly get dressed and grab twister from tobin's closet. tobin persuades the duke that even though there are cheerleaders there, waffle house has fantastic hashbrowns. he knows that the duke loves the hashbrowns the waffle house, so she grabs her shoes and they head out to the garage. tobin's parents left their honda civic in the garage so the three hop in and attempt to drive through all of the ice and snow. eventually, they manage to get to the highway. once they gain speed and get close to the waffle house, the civic loses control and slams into a snow bank, losing one of the tires. the three then continue to hike through the cold and snow to get to the waffle house, actually forgetting the twister game. they realize they forgot the game in the car once they were halfway there and then had to turn around and retrieve it because of keun's threat to not let them in to see the girls. with twister in hand, tobin, the duke and jp make it to the waffle house just in time. they meet the heartbroken jeb and he asks them if they knew anyone by the name of addie. the three say no, and he asks them that if they see her, to tell her that he was coming and that she would know what he meant. as the duke gets her hashbrowns, tobin attempts to talk to one of the cheerleaders. obviously not interested, the cheerleader makes small-talk and then sits down avoiding any more conversation with him. once tobin returns to his seat, he realizes that the duke is sitting outside on the sidewalk - clearly upset and sobbing. he sits beside her and asks what is wrong. she tells him that she hates that they do not refer to her as girly and she was actually jealous that he talked to the cheerleader in front of her because she assumed that he knew that she had feelings for him. completely unaware of her feelings, tobin tells her that he had a crush on her all along. they lean in for a kiss and kindle their new love. addie and jeb were in love from the moment they met, yet she attempted to change him into her own prince charming. because of this, jeb felt like he wasn't good enough for addie and they argued. at a party, they separate and addie finds her drunken self making out with a boy named charlie - cheating on jeb. she tells him, and she claims that it is over. jeb gets on a train to visit his family in an indian reservation. before he had left, addie sends jeb an email apologizing for everything and asks him to meet her at starbuck's, where she works, to talk everything out. addie does not know that jeb was leaving town. when he didn't respond or call, she knew he was really upset and that it was probably over for good. she went to fantastic sam's, a barber shop, and got all of her long, blonde hair cut off and colored it pink to show that she needed to change. on jeb's way home, his train also got stuck in the snow - the same train that jubilee found herself on. he attempted to call addie on multiple occasions to tell her he loved her and was sorry, yet could never make it through. addie calls her friends over to talk about things and they tell her that she always thinks of herself and can be self-absorbed at times. she disagrees and attempts to get them to change their minds by picking up a teacup pig from the pet store for her friend, tegan, in the morning on her break at work. once morning comes around, addie gets caught up by an old woman at the counter at work and the woman tells her that she is a christmas angel and that we often forget to do things for others when we are wrapped up in ourselves. she then leaves, leaving addie completely confused. her other friend, dorrie calls her to remind her to pick up the pig and addie has completely forgotten. she runs to the pet store and realizes that the pig had already been adopted by a woman named constantine. furious, addie steals the receipt and attempts to track down the mysterious woman and get tegan's pig back. once she finds the address, she realizes that constantine is the "christmas angel" from starbuck's and she adopted the pig just to teach addie a lesson. constantine gives addie back the pig and heads back to work, only to find that there are more customers waiting to be served. she notices a boy she went to school with named stuart at the counter. by his side stood his new girlfriend which is introduces as jubilee. as they get served, two other teens walk in. addie also recognizes them as tobin and angie (but people sometimes call her the duke). tobin reads her name tag and it reminds him that he had a message for her from jeb. he tells her and her stomach drops. she realizes that jeb did in fact get her message and that he was coming for her! at the same time, addie's boss keeps asking why there is a pig in the store and that she needs to get it out as soon as possible. at the blink of an eye, jeb walks in and embraces addie. he tells her about the train and the cheerleaders and how he could not get service to call her. tobin laughs because they were the same cheerleaders that they adventured out to see at the waffle house. jubilee hears of the cheerleaders, notices jeb and sees how all of their lives have been intertwined. they were all brought back together with new loves and new senses of life. ||| 7 ||| 7
wolfe accepts an invitation to address les quinze maîtres, an international group of master chefs that is holding its quinquennial meeting in west virginia. the kanawha spa resort (possibly based on the famous actual resort the greenbrier) is located there, and the current dean of the group, louis servan, is the resort's chef de cuisine. wolfe has been invited by servan to speak on the subject of contributions américaines à la haute cuisine. as a courtesy to wolfe, his oldest friend, marko vukcic, has invited archie to the gathering so that he can accompany wolfe. wolfe is siderodromophobic, but suppresses his anxiety enough to take the 14-hour train ride from new york to kanawha spa. on the way, vukcik visits wolfe's pullman compartment, to introduce him to jerome berin, another member of the group. berin is the originator of saucisse minuit, a sausage whose closely guarded recipe wolfe covets. but things do not go smoothly with berin. it comes out that berin is hostile to wolfe because he lives in the us, where phillip laszio also lives. laszio, another member of les quinze maîtres, seems to have made theft a habit. according to berin, laszio stole the secret of kidneys mountain style from a friend of berin's and claimed it as his own. laszio stole his wife dina from marko vukcic and he disparages vukcic's roast duck mr. richards. he stole his position at new york's hotel churchill from leon blanc, another of the master chefs. he serves something that he calls saucisse minuit at the churchill. berin, in full flood, threatens to kill laszio. hoping to acquire berin's secret, wolfe adopts with berin the obsequious line that he uses some years later in an attempt to wheedle a black orchid plant from lewis hewitt. berin regards wolfe's proposal that he sell the recipe to wolfe with astonishment and scorn. disgusted by wolfe's behavior, archie leaves the pullman for the club car, where he finds berin's beautiful daughter constanza. things progress nicely with constanza until archie perceives that his acquisitive instinct has been awakened, and he decides to call a halt to the progress. constanza manages to acquaint herself with another man in the club car by spilling her ginger ale on him. the man is barry tolman, the prosecuting attorney for the county where kanawha spa is located. archie leaves the two in the club car to get better acquainted. (their budding relationship continues as a minor subplot throughout the book.) the next night, at the resort, archie mingles with the chefs and their guests in a parlor off the dining room and adjacent kitchen. he notices that laszio does appear to inspire hard feelings. first rossi comes running into the parlor, carrying a steaming dish and shrieking that it had curdled – laszio suggests that the eggs might have been old, thus insulting both rossi and their host. then he stares with disapproval at his wife, who is dancing with another chef. blanc deals with laszio by avoiding him, and berin does so by glaring at him. that night, after dinner, a taste test takes place. a properly prepared printemps dressing must contain a variety of seasonings: chervil, tarragon, chives, shallots, and so on. laszio prepares nine dishes of it, each missing a different ingredient. the masters, and wolfe, are to taste from each dish and mark down which seasoning is missing from that dish. the tasting takes place in the dining room, with only laszio and the current taster present. the test begins. after the first five chefs have finished tasting, it's berin's turn. when he returns from the dining room to the parlor, vukcic, who is up next, is dancing with dina. he continues to do so for several minutes, interfering with the progress of the test. servan finally convinces vukcic to take his turn. then, after vallenko and rossi, it's wolfe's turn. after a few minutes, wolfe calls archie into the dining room. archie enters, and wolfe shows him laszio's body, hidden behind a room divider with a knife in his back. the authorities are called, including barry tolman, the prosecuting attorney who archie and constanza met on the train. after hours of inquiry, tolman decides to arrest berin, who has already expressed a motive to kill laszio. furthermore, all the chefs who preceded berin in the test saw laszio alive and well in the dining room, but vukcic and the other chefs who followed berin did not. and, at wolfe's suggestion, tolman compares the chefs' answers to the taste test. no one other than berin got more than two of the nine seasonings wrong, but berin missed seven: tolman's inference is that the murder left berin so distraught that he couldn't judge correctly. meantime, wolfe has had a visit from raymond liggett, laszio's employer at the churchill, and alberto malfi, laszio's first assistant. liggett has read of the murder in new york's morning papers and flown, with malfi, to west virginia to consult with wolfe. liggett needs to replace laszio as soon as possible with another culinary luminary – berin, if at all possible. wolfe refuses to intercede for liggett, but the question is rendered moot when tolman arrests berin. wolfe decides to do what he can to find evidence exonerating berin. he has two reasons: having seen berin return from the dining room after taking his turn tasting the sauce, he does not believe that berin could have just committed murder – his demeanor is too calm. and he sees a way to put berin in his debt. in one of the best known scenes in the series, wolfe meets with 14 black men, each of them a member of either the kitchen or the wait staff. a witness to the crime's aftermath has told wolfe that she saw a black man, dressed in the livery worn by the resort's workers, in the dining room at the time that the murder occurred. the man was holding a finger to his lips, hushing another black man who was peering through the door between the dining room and the pantry. wolfe wants to explore that statement with the kitchen and wait staff. in contrast to the treatment the men receive from the prosecuting attorney and, particularly, the sheriff, wolfe offers them courtesy and civility. even that approach is bootless, though, until wolfe makes an appeal to their sense of equity. he is looking for the man who was seen in the dining room, and says this: :but if you shield him because he is your color, there is a great deal to say. you are rendering your race a serious disservice. you are helping to perpetuate and aggravate the very exclusions which you justly resent. the ideal human agreement is one in which distinctions of race and color and religion are totally disregarded; anyone helping to preserve those distinctions is postponing that ideal; and you are certainly helping to preserve them. this speech so impresses paul whipple that he blurts out what he saw in the dining room from his vantage point in the pantry: a white man in blackface, warning him to be silent. this information is sufficient to get berin released from custody. having accomplished his objective — to put berin in his debt – wolfe turns his attention to the speech he is to give. while rehearsing the speech in his room, however, wolfe is wounded by a bullet, shot through an open window. the bullet tears his cheek open but does no other damage, and a local doctor is able to stitch the wound. but now wolfe, enraged, returns his attention to laszio's murder: clearly, the same person who killed laszio tried to kill wolfe, and wolfe intends to deliver the murderer to tolman. he initiates further inquiries, carried out mainly by saul panzer, and later presides over a dinner for the remaining members of les quinze maîtres composed exclusively of american cuisine. the maîtres are overwhelmed by the quality of the dishes and wolfe, in another famous scene, has the chefs responsible brought to the room to be applauded by the diners — all are black men. after the meal and despite the handicap of the facial wound, wolfe delivers his speech regarding american cuisine, and — to the surprise of the gathered masters — continues by delivering the evidence that will convict laszio's murderer and wolfe's assailant. on the train returning to new york, wolfe shames berin into disclosing to him the recipe for saucisse minuit. ||| 6 ||| 6
the dragon emperor ariakas devises a plan to corrupt the knights of solamnia and sends dragon highlord kitiara uth matar to tempt a power-hungry knight, derek crownguard, with the location of a dragon orb, which ariakas believes the knights will not be able to control. a disguised kitiara convinces derek that dragon orbs can be used to help the knights resist the invasion of their homeland, so derek, along with fellow knights brian donner and aran tallbow, sets out to the former seaport of tarsis to find more information about the dragon orbs. kitiara then travels to the city of haven to investigate the possible involvement of her friends and family in the death of the dragon highlord verminaard. kitiara quickly confirms that her former lover, tanis half-elven, and her half-brothers raistlin and caramon majere were involved in verminaard's death. kitiara also learns that tanis is traveling with his former girlfriend, the incredibly beautiful elven princess laurana, and consumed by jealousy, becomes dangerously obsessed with laurana. kitiara travels to icewall castle and a rivalry is formed between her and the dark elf wizard, feal-thas, the dragon highlord of the white army. she insists feal-thas allow the dragon orb under his care to be taken by the knights when they arrive, and feal-thas insists she first defeats the horrible guardian of the orb. kitiara does so and then travels to the city of tarsis to seek out her former companions. derek and his companions are also in tarsis. there, brian falls in love with an aesthethic named lilith, who directs them to the kender tasslehoff burrfoot who helps the knights decipher a book that confirms that there is a dragon orb being kept in icewall castle. before the knights can do anything with this knowledge though the city of tarsis is attacked by the red dragonarmy. the companions, who are also in tarsis, are split up when the dragonarmy attacks the city. tanis half-elven, caramon, raistlin, tika waylan, riverwind, and goldmoon travel with alhana starbreeze to the elvish kingdom of silvanesti (their journeys being described in detail in dragons of winter night). kitiara meanwhile has located the remaining companions consisting of sturm brightblade, flint fireforge, tasslehoff burrfoot, elistan, gilthanas,and laurana. after secretly observing laurana, kitiara decides the elven princess is much to beautiful a rival to let live and orders her forces to attack the companions while she ambushes laurana. kitiara attacks laurana from behind, taking the elfmaid by surprise. kitiara expects an easy victory over a rival she dismisses as just a pampered princess, but laurana fights back ferociously, and it is only with the help of the sivak draconian, slith, that kitiara is finally able to subdue laurana. meanwhile the rest of kitiara's forces are being defeated by elistan and sturm. kitiara and slith drag laurana off into a nearby alley, but before kitiara can kill laurana, she is driven off by the arrival of derek crownguard's group of knights and elistan. derek's knights then join with the rest of the companions to seek the dragon orb from icewall castle (the details of which are only briefly discussed or alluded to in dragons of winter night). more is learned about the bitter rivalry between sturm brightblade and derek crowngaurd, the latter of which is the main reason sturm was unable to complete his trials to become a knight. aran and especially brian begin to sympathize with sturm. kitiara is tormented with dreams of the dark goddess takhisis and a death knight named lord soth. little does she know, at the time, that takhisis is attempting to gain the service of soth in the dragonwars, and soth will only serve a dragon highlord with the courage to spend one night in his castle. he makes her return to the dragon army command in the city of sanction. suspicion spreads about kitiara's possible role in the death of verminaard and her connection to the companions. emperor ariakas fears she may be attempting a power-grab, and has her investigated. kitiara is found guilty, due in part to the testimony of feal-thas, and imprisoned. for the first time, kitiara prays to takhisis and promises to do anything, even confront lord soth, if her life were spared. she is overheard, via scrying, by ariakas's other lover, iolanthe. iolanthe frees kitiara and binds her to her promise regarding lord soth, feeling kitiara would ultimately triumph in the power struggle with ariakas. sturm, derek, and the rest of the company meet the natives of icewall and ask for their help in defeating feal-thas. laurana devises a plan to use elistan's magic to help them attack feal-thas's stronghold, icewall castle, and the icefolk agree to help. the icefolk also give laurana a frost reaver, a magic battle axe made of ice, for the upcoming battle. the companions and their icefolk allies successfully attack icewall castle and confront feal-thas. aran and brian fall to feal-thas's wolves but then laurana uses the frost reaver to slay feal-thas. as detailed in dragons of winter night, the companions find not only the dragon orb, but a frozen good dragon and a broken dragonlance. kitiara makes her way to the castle of lord soth, battles many of his guardians, and stands up to him before falling unconscious. lord soth is impressed, gives her protection from his guardians as she sleeps, and agrees to join the takhisis's army under the command of kitiara. ||| 2 ||| 2

in the present she works at the glenmore, a hotel on big moose lake, to earn money during the summer. the body of grace brown is found in the lake near the hotel. earlier that day, grace had asked mattie to burn a pack of letters. mattie didn't have to time to burn them. she is drawn in by the mystery of what they might say, and she begins to read them. they reveal some shocking information about grace's lover, chester gillette, who checked into the hotel as carl grahm. grace was pregnant with chester's child at the time, so he killed her. royal loomis is also a major part of this story. he has recently developed a crush on mattie, but she can't figure out why. she thinks she is plain, bookish, and too smart for her own good. even though mattie knows she likes royal, she continues to push him away because she doesn't think he likes her for the right reasons. despite the rejection, it draws royal even closer. still young and naive, royal's continuous advances make mattie nervous, but she can't resist. she compares royal to the characters in books she reads, and makes herself think that he is as heroic as the literary characters. he tries to connect with her by giving her a book. unfortunately he chooses to give her a cookbook, which is a backhanded gift that shows he wants her to be just like other girls. mattie is more confused than ever with royal's insincere advances. unfortunately, all of the mixed feelings that she has for royal end up being pointless because in the end, he only likes her because he wanted to get a part of her land. emmie hubbard is mattie's lonely, poor, and depressed neighbor who has seven children. emmie is having an affair with a married man, mr. loomis (royal's father). royal resents the hubbards. he thinks that his father treats them better than his own family. after weaver's house was set on fire by the same people that murdered his father -taking all of his saved money with it- emmie steps up and invites weaver's mother to stay with her in her home. now emmie has a good, strong-willed woman to clean her up and help her with a business to make money. weaver's mother has a place to stay where she is needed. in the end, mattie makes the incredibly difficult choice to leave the north woods and go to school in new york city. she leaves in the morning, and the only person she tells is weaver. she writes three letters, one to her father, one to royal, and one to weaver's mother. to her father, she leaves two dollars and a promise that she will keep in touch. to royal she leaves the ring that he gave to her when he proposed. finally, to weaver's mother she leaves just enough money to pay off emmie's taxes. she also gives weaver money for a train ticket to college. as her closest friend, weaver does not want her to leave but he understands that she is going to make a better life for herself. though she feels incredibly guilty for leaving, she can't help but also feel excited, scared, and willing. she has made her peace with grace because she decided to show the letters to the world so now every one can see the true, tragic story of grace brown. she is now ready to leave it behind, and keep her life in the north woods as a memory. ||| 7 ||| 7
william de worde is the black sheep of an influential ankh-morpork family, scraping out a humble lifestyle as a common scribe and making extra pocket money by producing a gossipy newsletter for foreign notables. when william falls in with a group of dwarves who have come to ankh-morpork to set up shop with their printing press, he inadvertently founds am’s first newspaper. realizing that with their press the dwarves can help him put out a newsletter every day, william begins scrambling to find enough interesting events to fill up the space. arguing that it isn’t worth the effort just to make a few copies for william’s wealthy foreign subscribers, the dwarves print hundreds of copies of the “ankh-morpork times” and hire a group of oddball beggars to pitch them on the street. william is shocked when the newsheets sell like hot cakes, bringing in more money than he wants or knows what to do with. before he knows it william has assembled a newsroom staff, including sacharissa cripslock, a prim young woman who attracts news items from talkative, flirtatious city guards, otto, a vampire photographer from uberwald who has sworn off drinking blood and often disintegrates in his own camera flash, and rocky, a quasi-literate troll who deals with the more irate members of the public. meanwhile, a conspiracy is afoot in the city to depose the patrician, lord vetinari. the wealthy and powerful (but anonymous) committee to unelect the patrician hire mr. pin and mr. tulip, a pair of villainous mercenaries known as the new firm, to frame vetinari for attempted murder and embezzlement. the plan goes off without a hitch, except that pin and tulip allow a witness to escape from the scene; lord vetinari’s prized terrier, wuffles. william and the times staff investigate the strange charges against the patrician and set out to find the missing wuffles, all while trying to cope with threats from the local guilds, the sudden appearance of a competing paper (the scandalous and largely fiction-filled “ankh-morpork inquirer”), pressure from the city watch, and the chance that otto may fall off the wagon at any moment. william makes the mistake of advertising a reward for information leading to wuffles' recovery. hundreds of ankh-morpork citizens mob the offices with dogs of every shape and variety (including many that are actually cats, birds, or cows) hoping to cash in. the new firm arrive too, capturing every terrier in the crowd hoping that one of them will be wuffles, and trying to intimidate the times staff. otto drives them off using his magical “dark light” photography method, which has the inadvertent effect of showing mr. pin the angry ghosts of his victims who follow him around and triggering a moral crisis for the normally remorseless thug. an anonymous tipster named "deep bone" (actually gaspode, the talking dog who operates as the brains of the beggar crew who sell the times) helps william track down wuffles, and when sacharissa discovers the new firm’s hideout in william’s own family manor he has enough evidence gathered to break the story wide open. just as he is preparing to go to press, the new firm return to take revenge. in the ensuing struggle a lamp explodes and the times offices catch fire. william and the others take refuge outside while pin and tulip hide in the cellar. hot melted lead from the destroyed printing press leaks down on them through the roof, and pin resorts to murdering his partner so that he can save himself by standing on the much larger man’s corpse. pin, now only partially sane, emerges from the cellars and attacks william once the fire is out, only to be killed when he is impaled on the memo spike from william’s desk. with the press and office destroyed, it looks like the times is out of business, but with the application of a crossbow, dwarven axes, and otto’s sense of dramatic atmosphere, the crew manage to “borrow” one of the inquirer’s presses for the evening. the big story breaks the next day and lord vetinari’s name is cleared just before a new, guild-controlled patrician would have seized power. the new firm, meanwhile, discuss the finer points of reincarnation, and who does and does not merit it, with death. william goes to confront the man behind the committee to unelect: his own estranged father, lord de worde. after a tense argument, william blackmails his father with the information about his criminal doings, forcing him to flee the city or be exposed. in the end william is ambivalent about the new and unexpected role of the free press in his life and in the world, but resolves that someone must tell the public the truth about what goes on in the city, even if the public doesn't want to hear it. the times comes to be recognized, if not exactly welcomed, by the powers that be in the city, and william and sacharissa make plans to expand even further, hiring new staff, establishing offices in other cities, and hopefully one day squeezing in time for a lunch date in between deadlines. ||| 2 ||| 6
ship of magic is the first book of the liveship traders series and follows the fortunes of the vestrit family, centered around the liveship vivacia. a liveship is a ship made of wizardwood, a mystical substance, giving it magical properties. when three generations of a ship's owners die on board, a liveship "quickens", meaning that the ship awakens and becomes a sentient being with all the memories of the ancestors who have contributed to the ship's quickening. captain vestrit's grandmother had ordered the liveship vivacia, and the vestrit family is still in debt to the rain wild trader family from whom they bought the wizardwood even before the ship was quickened. only a liveship is capable of crossing the perilous rain wild river to trade with the rain wilders, who have valuable goods plundered from an ancient elderling ruin. the vestrits live in bingtown, which borders the sea, jamaillia, chalced, and the rain wilds. their charter comes from jamaillia; however, the current leader of jamaillia has ignored the promises his ancestors made with bingtown, which causes outrage among bingtown's citizens. chalced's influence and customs are spreading throughout the world, because of its profitable slave trade. the story begins when ephron vestrit dies on vivacia and quickens it. his daughter, althea, who had assumed that the ship would come to her after her father's death, is shocked to see that her father has given the ship to her sister, keffria, who in turn had given ownership to kyle, her chalcedean husband. kyle believes that he can restore the family fortune by entering the slave trade. kyle said that althea would never sail the vivacia until she proves her seamanship by showing him a ship's ticket. althea sets off to prove she is a capable sailor. however, kyle discovers that he is unable to control the ship without a blood relative of the vestrits on board. without althea, the only alternative is to force his son wintrow, who wants to be a priest, to serve aboard the ship. wintrow finds it hard to adjust to life on the ship. despite his bitterness at being torn from the priesthood, he has a growing bond with the ship that he can't ignore. at the same time as all of these events, the ambitious pirate kennit desires to become more than a pirate: he wishes to unite all pirate townships under him as king. kennit pursues slaver ships to free the slaves while throwing the slavers overboard. a crafty man with a gift for foresight, kennit realizes that if he frees the slaves, he'll gain the allegiance of their family and friends. the freed slaves then crew the captured vessels as a pirate fleet under kennit's command. however, kennit desires to have a liveship of his own for his flagship. he targets the vivacia, who has become a slaver ship under kyle's persuasion. kennit manages to capture the vivacia and becomes her captain. to get the proof of her seaworthiness that kyle requires, althea works on board a slaughtership, disguised as a man. she discovers that brashen trell, a former mate on the vivacia, and a disgraced younger son of another prominent bingtown family, is also serving on the ship. unfortunately, althea is denied a ship's ticket when the captain of the slaughteship discovers her true name. althea and brashen separate after a romantic dispute. brashen takes a position on a pirate's trader ship. althea joins the crew of the liveship ophelia, owned by the tenira family, headed back to bingtown which then leads to the next installment of the liveship trader series, the mad ship. ||| 2 ||| 2
sten, leader of the mantis team 13, empire's covert ops, is on the way back from eryx cluster, when his spy ship is ambushed by janissary cruiser. after crashing on nearby planet, team 13 is able to overpower janissars, capture their ship and return home. the eternal emperor is not pleased with results of sten's mission, which confirms existence of very rare mineral in eryx cluster. the shortest path to eryx goes right through lupus cluster. also known as "wolf worlds", lupus cluster is a home of the cult of talemein, religious dictatorship, whose military half, janissars, practice piracy to acquire money and ships, and ruthlessly kill any captives who do not immediately and fervently convert. according to emperor's analysis, in three years, every "wannabe merchant, miner and explorer" will travel right through lupus cluster, where they will be slaughtered en masse by one or other talamein faction. emperor will have to send imperial guard, which will be a great hit on his public relations, because he gave the worlds to the young soldier talemein a few thousand years before. since official action is out of the discussion, the only acceptable solution is unofficial one. sten receives very simple order: in three years he has to pacify whole lupus cluster, by someone who will not shoot at miners when they arrive (i.e. not janissars). how, it doesn't matter. he can recruit anyone, but no more than one other member from mantis. sten took alex kilgour, his best friend and former teammember from mantis. sten's first action is meeting with "moderate" talamein, ruled by merchant prince parral and his prophet theodomir, and offering them mercenary services and unification of cluster. they accept, secretly planning to kill sten when he gets the job done. after that, sten offers help to bhor, natives of lupus cluster. bhor are race of knuckle dragging neanderthals, that, when they're not tearing their competitors in half the long way, they're doing the same to their competitor's bank accounts. being militant and violent beings, they quickly develop a great friendship with sten and alex. sten then begins his campaign by attacking janissary military center, followed by multiple distraction attacks. his primary objective is to attack janissary shipyards. slightly understrength, sten accepted help of mathias, theodomir's son, who has small group of his followers available. during the attack parral betrays sten and orders his ships to retreat, leaving sten to die on the planet. luckily, sten is saved by intervention of bhor, and he decides to pay parral a little visit. after parral's unfortunately demise from the hands of mathias, eternal emperor personally visits lupus cluster and declares prophet theodomir as legitimate ruler, in spite of the fact that sten warned mahoney that he needed more time for situation to settle. day after emperor left, mathias murders his own father, falsely accuses sten and declared holy war against traitors, unbelievers, and "that heretic emperor". sten and alex escapes, but his mercenaries are captured. sten asks mahoney to give him back mantis team 13, hoping that he can resolve situation. with the help of his team, sten infiltrates lupus cluster capital, where he frees his imprisoned mercenaries and launches an attack. eventually, sten captures mathias, druggs him and forces him to recant and publicly declare peace. the eternal emperor is very pleased with sten's action in lupus cluster and promotes him to commander of the gurkhas, emperor's personal bodyguards. ||| 2 ||| 5

in his review of strip tease, donald e. westlake commented that, at the center of all the wackiness was an accessible, touching storyline: a single mother’s quest to rescue her young daughter from a reckless husband and an inadequate foster care system. skinny dip has at its center a wife who survives a murder attempt by her husband, and is driven not just by the need to get even, but to find out the reason he did it. this gives the novel more focus than some of hiaasen’s other books, which often involve the characters running across each other in random ways, or going on unplanned wanderings across florida. the other central plot is the fight to save the everglades, and the role that the villains are playing in its destruction. somewhere along the way, the two plot lines converge, and the quest to take revenge on chaz becomes tied up with the aim of stopping red’s pollution. in other words, the reader is offered a choice of which thing to root for: some readers may think that chaz’s betrayal of the environment for money makes him detestable, but trying to murder his wife is what makes him a true monster; other readers may think the exact opposite. skinny dip is also enriched by a variety of subplots: tool's gradual moral awakening, as he grows closer to a dying old lady who is too proud to admit that she has been abandoned by her family; karl rolvaag's longing for his native minnesota, and his search for his escaped pet pythons; chaz’s obsession with sex and his desperate attempts to reverse the erectile dysfunction which is his only sign of guilt over joey’s murder, including experimenting with a black-market version of viagra — "the food and drug administration (fda) definitely would not approve."; and finally, the suitcase full of money, which changes hands until it falls into the grip of the least likely person in the story. the novel contains many scenes reminiscent of classic farces. for instance, at one point there are five people in the perrone house, three of whom are trying to hide their presence from the other: at the center is chaz and his “back-up” girlfriend medea, with whom he has just unsuccessfully attempted sexual relations; hiding under the bed is joey, caught in the middle of another infiltration of the house; tool is in another part of the house, ordered to protect perrone but ordered by him to stay out of the way of his date; and finally mick, who enters in search of joey and, when he encounters tool, politely asks him if he’s going to try to stop mick. (“what a dumb-ass question. of course i am.”) in a similar situation, chaz, expecting sex with rose, is drunk and drugged and lured into bed, not knowing that the woman he’s groping for is in fact his wife. other funny situations arise out of chaz’s paranoia and ineptness as a killer. he imagines he’s surrounded by enemies, but he always manages to look in the wrong direction. even when the truth — for example, joey — is right in front of him, he attributes it to hallucinations caused by the west nile virus, rather than recognizing it for a sophisticated hoax. ||| 1 ||| 5

the story opens with prospero at home on a late summer day when he feels particularly uneasy. in the evening he receives an unexpected visit from his friend roger bacon, and the two discuss unusual phenomena that have transpired lately, especially those concerning a mysterious book for which roger has been searching england. the following morning the two wizards find prospero’s house besieged by agents of some other wizard who seems to have ill designs for them. they escape the house by shrinking themselves down and sailing out on a model ship via an underground stream accessible through prospero’s basement. once they regain their normal size they visit a library of records where prospero discovers, as roger stands guard outside, that a seal appearing in the mysterious aforementioned book belongs to melichus, an old rival of his. unfortunately, at that point a person comes into the library and claims to have killed roger. prospero flees the library and spends the night in a nearby town, where he luckily escapes an attack from some sort of evil creature sent by melichus. the following day he travels to the cursed grove where melichus is supposed to be buried, only to discover that the one buried there is not melichus, but only one of his former servants. he presumes, therefore, that melichus is still alive. after narrowly escaping from the cursed grove he travels to the town of five dials, where he stays at an inn with somewhat unsettling clientele and staff. unable to sleep, he becomes suspicious of the inn and begins checking the other rooms, only to find them all empty. in the last room he finds the innkeeper with a large knife and flees the inn, whereupon he discovers that the entire town was an illusion (presumably created by melichus). at last prospero and roger are reunited at the actual site called five dials, a lone inn on the edge of the country. here they discuss why melichus is after prospero: they once created a magical item together, a kind of crystal ball resembling a green glass paperweight. since neither one can fully possess it without the other’s cooperation, prospero will have some share in melichus’ power until he is dead. they also determine that melichus is using the mysterious book mentioned early in the story to create a permanent winter over the world. while staying the night at five dials they meet a small armed force that intends to attack a village across the border. roger and prospero thwart the army by destroying a necessary bridge and begin traveling to the village where the paperweight is kept, and where, they presume, melichus is now. as they travel, unseasonably cold weather gradually sets in. though the way to their destination is blocked, they find a monk herbalist who lets them in through a back entrance. once in the village they do find melichus studying the book. prospero attempts to steal the paperweight, only to be transported to a different world. melichus follows him there, but prospero meets another wizard who takes the magical item and defeats melichus. in the end, prospero returns home to find that the early winter has subsided. ||| 2 ||| 2
the book has an introduction, a main body and a conclusion, divided into seven parts with a total of 21 chapters. the introduction sketches the history of the last thirty years where economic shock doctrine has been applied throughout the world, from south america in the 1970s to new orleans after hurricane katrina. klein introduces two of her main themes. #that practitioners of the shock doctrine tend to seek a blank slate on which to create their ideal free market economies, which usually requires a violent destruction of the existing economic order. #the similarities between economic shock doctrine and the original shock therapy – a psychiatric technique where electric shocks were applied to mentally ill patients. part 1 begins with a chapter on psychiatric shock therapy and the covert experiments conducted by the psychiatrist ewen cameron in collusion with the central intelligence agency: how it was partially successful in distorting and regressing patients' original personality, but ineffectual in developing a "better" personality to replace it. parallels with economic shock therapy are made, including a digression on how government agencies harnessed some of the lessons learned to create more effective torture techniques. torture, according to klein, has often been an essential tool for authorities who have implemented aggressive free market reforms – this assertion is stressed throughout the book. she suggests that for historical reasons the human rights movement has often portrayed torture without explaining its context, which has made it frequently appear as pointless cruelty. the second chapter introduces milton friedman and his chicago school of economics, whom klein describes as leading a movement committed to free markets even less regulated than before the great depression. part 2 discusses the use of shock doctrine to transform south american economies in the 1970s, focusing on the coup in chile led by general augusto pinochet. the apparent necessity for the unpopular policies associated with shock therapy to be supported by torture is explored. part 3 covers attempts to apply the shock doctrine without the need for extreme violence against sections of the population. the mild shock therapy of margaret thatcher is explained as being made possible by the falklands war, while free market reform in bolivia was possible due to a combination of pre-existing economic crises and the charisma of jeffrey sachs. part 4 reports on how the shock doctrine was applied in poland, russia, south africa and to the tiger economies during the 1997 asian financial crisis. part 5 introduces the "disaster capitalism complex", where the author describes how companies have learnt to profit from disasters. she talks about how the same personnel move easily from security-related posts in us government agencies to lucrative positions in corporations. part 6 discusses the occupation of iraq, which klein describes as the most comprehensive and full-scale implementation of the shock doctrine ever attempted. part 7 is about the winners and losers of economic shock therapy – how narrow groups will often do very well by moving into luxurious gated communities while large sections of the population are left with decaying public infrastructure, declining incomes and increased unemployment. conclusion is about the backlash against the shock doctrine and economic institutions that propagate it like the world bank and imf. south america and lebanon post-2006 are examined as sources of positive news, where politicians are already rolling back free-market policies, with some mention of the increased campaigning by community-minded activists in south africa and china. ||| 4 ||| 4

while talese's book outlined the history of the paper back to adolph ochs's 1896 takeover of the then-failing paper, the focus was on the times between 1945 and the 1960s. the washington bureau of the times sometimes was seen as the center of the paper's power, but after the death of publisher orvil dryfoos in 1963, talese saw this center as shifting to new york city under arthur ochs "punch" sulzberger beginning in 1963. the title of the book indicated the thrust of talese's thesis. the kingdom was the new york times newsroom, and the power was the influence the paper wielded, particularly in its interpretation of the paper's famous motto "all the news that's fit to print". talese looked at the personalities driving times news coverage such as managing editor clifton daniel, executive editor james reston, rising star a. m. rosenthal and punch sulzberger. time found talese's portrayal of the highly-respected reston as particularly critical. talese described reston as a "times-man in the old sense, a man emotionally committed to the institution as a way of life, a religion, a cult." ||| 4 ||| 4

when the air raid sirens go off, sarah, a schoolgirl in england, runs home to help her stepmother, veronica, prepare the living room to protect the family from nuclear fallout. sarah and veronica assemble living provisions, rudimentary sanitary supplies, and clothes and toys for veronica's son william (aged five) and daughter catherine (aged seven). the family then shelter inside as the bombs fall. sarah realises that the water the rest of the family has been using has become contaminated with radioactive particles from the unblocked chimney, and all apart from catherine are likely to contract radiation sickness. veronica displays symptoms first and leaves the house several times to collect canned (safe) food for catherine. she tells sarah that community members have gathered in the church and a local farmer is giving away contaminated meat for free. later, when her symptoms become worse, veronica leaves, presumably to die. william also begins to suffer from radiation sickness, and when he is near death and sarah begins to weaken she leaves the house, bundling catherine up against contamination. she gathers food for her from the house of the town farmer and takes her to the remote home of johnson. johnson has been prepared for the war, and appears unaffected by radiation sickness. this section begins with a flashback to the day of the war, which reveals that sarah's father, bill, a lecturer at bristol university, was driving to a meeting when a woman named erica flagged him down. as a leading authority on cellular cloning, she had a pass granting her (and anyone accompanying her) shelter in a government bunker. bill takes erica to the bunker at avon, but had mixed feelings about surviving when his wife and children did not. within two months of the war, britain is gripped by a nuclear winter. when the nuclear winter finally ends, the authorities send helicopters on reconnaissance missions, which reveal that against all odds, there are people still alive outside. they also learn that the ozone layer has been damaged, so anyone who goes outside must wear protective clothing. erica feels it is her duty as a woman still of child-bearing age to help repopulate society, so she marries bill and gives birth to a daughter, ophelia. bill is assigned to teach the bunker's teenagers, and, though he is officially meant to teach science-based subjects, introduces subjects such as english literature and politics into the curriculum. ophelia spends the first sixteen years of her life in the bunker, where she calmly accepts the restrictions on her life. but other youngsters, in particular an anglo-american youth named dwight allison, are not so accepting. under the influence of bill's teachings, dwight has come to believe that general macallister, the man in charge of the bunker, has too much authority and, one day, spray-paints a slogan denouncing macallister as a "fascist pig". as a punishment, dwight is sentenced to a year of hard labour and expelled from school. some time later, a large herd of cattle is found in one of the outside communities. macallister orders dwight's father, colonel jeff allison, to bring the cattle to the bunker for "government protection". dwight believes it would be wrong to take the cattle when the outsiders depend on them for survival and hurries to tell bill. bill and dwight decide that the best course of action would be to leave the bunker and warn the community which owns the cattle; ophelia accompanies them, but she does so because they are the people she is closest to, not because she feels they are doing the right thing. outside, the world is recovering from the effects of the war and ophelia is able to experience things she has previously only known about via her father's lessons. they discover the cattle owners are johnson's community, and bill is soon reunited with catherine, who is heavily pregnant with her eighth child. she married johnson when she was in her teens, but six of the children she has already given birth to have died in infancy due to genetic mutation. since johnson is old enough to be catherine's father, ophelia is disgusted, thinking the outsiders are uncivilised compared to the people in the bunker. dwight retorts that the latter are like "dinosaurs", attempting to maintain pre-war standards of living and not adapting to the changed conditions in the world. during the course of the day, ophelia meets catherine's only surviving daughter, lilith, who was born with white eyes and pale hairs all over her body; she also has a vocal cord defect which prevents her from speaking. since there is no other community which can handle a herd the size of johnson's, bill and dwight are unable to get the cattle away before colonel allison and his men come to collect them. johnson attempts to compromise by offering colonel allison enough cattle to form the basis of a herd, but colonel allison says he is not in a position to negotiate. realising the discussion is going nowhere, dwight sabotages all but one of the army trucks, making it impossible to take the cattle back to the bunker, and escapes into the wilderness. ophelia wants to return to the bunker, even though doing so means she will never see dwight again. the section ends with ophelia in tears, as lilith (with her newborn sister in her arms) smiles at her pityingly. five decades after the war, the bunker is decaying and fuel supplies have run out, and the people in the bunker have been forced to seek sanctuary among outside communities. on one such expedition, ophelia's son, simon, sees a pack of wild dogs stalking a person who is searching the ruins of an old house. he fires his gun, killing one of the dogs and scattering the rest, then goes to help the person they were stalking. that person proves to be a mutant girl named laura, who tells him that "weapons are evil" and that he has no right to kill a living thing. when simon sees that laura's body is covered with hair (which protects her skin from being damaged by ultra-violet radiation), he is repulsed by her, thinking she is an "ape". shortly after meeting laura, simon injures his leg on a rusty nail. since his people have no means to treat injuries, he is taken to johnson's community, where laura lives. rather than having separate homes for each family, the community consists of a large "house" which reminds simon of a tibetan monastery. seeing the well-ordered community where people have learned to make everything they need themselves, simon begins to feel that his own people are "failures", having tried to restore pre-war standards at the expense of their children's futures. simon meets catherine, now known as "blind kate," blind after years of exposure to ultraviolet radiation and covered in festering sores. simon sees in her a glimpse of his own future and, on learning that she is laura's grandmother, is so repulsed at the thought of being related to a mutant that he can't bring himself to acknowledge it. instead, when laura asks if he has ever heard of the people who once came to the community to take the cattle, he claims not to know them. the next morning, simon finds himself the topic of much discussion among the mutants. unable to bear being the subject of pity, he storms out of the dining hall and, following a vitriolic lecture from blind kate, leaves the settlement even though his leg is not fully healed. he plans to catch up with the rest of his party, but a pack of dogs chases him into a ruined church. while there, he sees a glider flying overhead. the glider's pilot alerts laura's people to simon's whereabouts. laura rides to the rescue on her horse and uses her psychic powers to send the dogs away. she tells simon that she and the rest of the mutants have developed telekinetic powers and the ability to communicate telepathically. she believes the mutants are a new species of humans, but they need the technical knowledge simon's people have kept alive if they are to reach their full potential. simon comes to terms with what his ancestors did to the world and realises that, though he can't change the past, he can do something positive with his own life by helping his people collaborate with the mutants. he comes to believe that the nuclear war was meant to happen, so that laura (whom he finally acknowledges as his cousin) and the rest of her kind could be born. ||| 5 ||| 5
the story revolves around the norwegian police officer harry hole, who is sent to sydney by the royal norwegian police directorate to serve as the norwegian attaché for the australian police's investigation into the murder of a young female norwegian b-celebrity, inger holter, who was residing in australia. initially trying to adapt to the great differences in time, temperatures, environment, and cultures of oslo and sydney, harry is introduced to andrew kensington, an aboriginal and homicide detective for the sydney police, his nominal partner in the investigation. hole is informed that holter's body was found dashed on coastal rocks just under some cliffs north of the city, and that the police believe that she was raped before her death. however, her body was severely cut during her fall from the cliffs, and any dna remains from the assailant that would previously have been present are now washed away. at first, her boyfriend, evans white is approached as a suspect. andrew informs harry that evans immigrated to australia with his divorced mother in the 1970's and eventually became a local drug lord in the town of nimbin. through their insertion into the drug world in nimbin and their meeting with reluctant white, harry grows confident that white is responsible for holter's death. harry and andrew visit the albury, the sydney pub where inger holter worked as a bartender. while there, harry meets the witness birgitta enquist -- a swede -- and unprofessionally but successfully asks her on a date. andrew takes harry to a local boxing tournament in a small town, organized by the jim chivers boxing team. harry is introduced to robin toowoomba after the match, the match champion and protege of andrew. harry's investigation under chief inspector larry wadkins, a keen, but arrogant man, turns to data analysis of rape victim records in new south wales, specifically with respect to white, blond-haired strangle victims. no culprit is identified, however, the team discovers a string of rape cases fitting those parameters which leads back years. in the process of attempting to interview a drug lord in sydney, harry ends up in a visceral fight. andrew comes to his rescue, but receives a bad concussion in the brawl and is consequently hospitalized. harry's growing suspicion that otto rechtnagel, a homosexual clown that frequented the albury and knew inger well, was responsible for her death based on his circus's appearance near every location and time of the death of all of the blonde rape cases over the past years. he confronts andrew with this information at the hospital, hoping to drag something out of him that might be useful for the impending police raid on the circus event to capture the clown, knowing that andrew knew rechtnagel well. andrew desperately attempts to dissuade harry from taking rechtnagel, suggesting it is a matter of life or death. just as rechtnagel's act ends and he leaves the stage, harry and his associates search the backstage, but cannot find the man. they search everywhere until they find his dismembered body in the steaming shower room. with rechtnagel's death, harry works under the assumption that his killer was associated with the rape cases but that the clown could still have been the serial rapist/killer and that his alleged homosexuality was only a cover for his true hetero/bisexual tendencies. the day after the murder, harry and another associate sergei lebie discover andrew's body hanging from the electrical cord of a ceiling light in his apartment. harry also discovers a small stash of used and unused syringes for heroin injection in the apartment, but conceals this from lebie. with this discovery, harry interviews evans again, only to find out that andrew was one of his clients, but that he had established a respectable reputation for buying small doses at a constant rate and for always being able to pay. harry interviews a prostitute -- whose pimp andrew introduced him to -- back at his hotel room under the pretense of wanting to have sex with her. breaking down and having reverted to his unrestrained alcoholism, harry poorly mismanages the situation when birgitta attempts to surprise him by coming by. finding him drunk, naked, and with a prostitute, she storms out, giving harry reason to believe that their 'relationship' is over. the next morning, the hungover harry is expelled from the hotel for the noise made during the argument and his resulting rampage against the objects in the hotel room, however, the ultimate cause lay with letting a prostitute into his room. for several days, harry wanders about the city and tries to act out detective while continually debilitated by his heavy intoxication. he is consequently kicked out from night clubs where he tries to pry information out of strongmen in the sydney underworld. finally recovered from his binge, harry contacts birgitta. under harry's urging, birgitta offers to bait evans by offering to meet him to buy dope. the plan is for her to press him to reveal information about the murders by threatening to go to the police with hearsay information she had allegedly obtained from inger. the operation falls apart when birgitta disappears and the police are incapable of tracking down evans in the vicinity of the planned meeting point or of the place that they last had contact with her. harry later interrogates evans once the police finds him back in nimbin. he claims that he was immediately suspicious of enquist, and that she failed to meet him at the time and place agreed upon. harry still doubts white. through another meeting, the prostitute reveals to harry that toowoomba was a client of hers and that he had frequently requested her to service him while wearing a blond wig. he had also mock-strangled her. harry confronts toowoomba over the phone, who coldly admits to having committed all of the crimes. toowoomba had for a time been in a relationship with rechtnagel and the poor clown had eventually discovered his evil antics. given andrew's hopes for toowoomba's career, andrew had attempted to partially lead harry off track until he was sent back to norway. once it became clear that otto would spill the beans to the police, he became a loose end for toowoomba. harry and the police break into toowoomba's apartment. although they cannot find birgitta there, they find a picture of a sailboat and discover a sailboat registered to toowoomba in sydney. the sailboat is empty, but they find birgitta's body chained to the bottom of the docks. all hell breaks loose when harry and the police pursue toowoomba to the sydney aquarium. there, toowoomba nearly escapes on the roof, but harry coldly shoots the man once in the leg and once in the back. he falls into the tank containing a large predatory fish that wrenches his body to the bottom. ||| 1 ||| 6
starship troopers takes place in the midst of an interstellar war between the terran federation of earth and the arachnids (referred to as "the bugs") of klendathu. it is narrated as a series of flashbacks by juan rico, and is one of only a few heinlein novels set out in this fashion. the novel opens with rico aboard the corvette rodger young (named after medal of honor winner rodger wilton young), serving with the platoon known as "rasczak's roughnecks" (named after the platoon leader, lt. rasczak) about to embark on a raid against the planet of the "skinnies," who are allies of the arachnids. we learn that he is a cap(sule) trooper in the terran federation's mobile infantry. the raid itself, one of the few instances of actual combat in the novel, is relatively brief: the roughnecks land on the planet, destroy their targets, and retreat, suffering a single casualty in the process (dizzy flores, who dies in the retrieval boat of wounds received in action). the story then flashes back to rico's graduation from high school, and his decision to sign up for federal service over the objections of his father, who disowns him. this is the only chapter that describes rico's civilian life, and most of it is spent on the monologues of two people: retired lt. col. jean v. dubois, rico's school instructor in "history and moral philosophy," and fleet sergeant ho, a recruiter for the armed forces of the terran federation. some see dubois as speaking for heinlein throughout the novel; he delivers what is probably the book's most famous soliloquy on violence, it "... has settled more issues in history than has any other factor." fleet sergeant ho's monologues examine the nature of military service, and his anti-military tirades seem primarily to be a contrast with dubois. we learn, later, that his rants are part of a policy intended to scare off applicants signing up without conviction. interspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to rico's high school history and moral philosophy course, which describe how in the terran federation of rico's day, the rights of a full citizen (to vote, and hold public office) must be earned through some form of volunteer federal service. those residents who have not exercised their right to perform this federal service retain all other rights generally associated with a modern democracy (free speech, assembly, etc.), but they cannot vote or hold public office. this structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the "20th century western democracies", brought on by both social failures at home (among which appear to be poor handling of juvenile delinquency) and military defeat by the chinese hegemony overseas. in the next section of the novel, after being denied all his higher preferred service choices, rico goes to boot camp at camp arthur currie, on the northern prairies. five chapters are spent exploring rico's experience there, including his adjustment to a very different situation, entering the service under the training of the leading instructor, career ship's sergeant charles zim. camp currie is rigorous by design; less than ten percent of the recruits finish basic training. the rest either resign, are expelled, or die in training. one of the chapters deals with ted hendrick, a fellow recruit and constant complainer who is flogged and expelled for striking a superior officer during a simulated combat exercise (he caught sgt. zim by surprise after being struck by the sergeant for failure to perform during the exercise). another recruit, a deserter who murdered a baby girl while awol, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police and return to camp currie. rico himself is flogged for poor handling of (simulated) nuclear weapons during a drill; despite these experiences he eventually graduates and is assigned to a unit in the fleet. at some point during rico's training, the "bug war" has changed from border incidents to formal war, and rico finds himself taking part in combat operations. the war "officially" starts with an arachnid attack that annihilates the city of buenos aires (which kills juan's mother who was visiting there), although rico makes it clear that prior to the attack there had been many "'incidents,' 'patrols,' or 'police actions.'" rico briefly describes the terran federation's loss at the battle of klendathu during which his unit is decimated and his ship destroyed. following klendathu, the terran federation is reduced to making hit-and-run raids similar to the one described at the beginning of the novel (which, chronologically would be placed between chapters 10 and 11). rico meanwhile finds himself posted to rasczak's roughnecks. this part of the book focuses on the daily routine of military life, as well as the relationship between officers and non-commissioned officers, personified in this case by rasczak and sergeant jelal. eventually, rico decides to become a career soldier, and one of his fellow troopers claims he is officer material and should consider volunteering for officer candidate school. he applies and is accepted. it turns out to be just like boot camp, only "squared and cubed with books added." rico manages to make it through to the final exam, "in the fleet". he is commissioned a temporary third lieutenant for his field-test and commands his own unit during operation royalty. it is revealed at the end of the chapter that one of the enlisted men he leads into combat is his former basic training instructor, sergeant zim. although personally convinced that he badly mismanaged his men, he passes the final exam, and graduates as a second lieutenant. there is also an account of the meeting between rico and his father, who volunteered for service after his wife, rico's mother, was killed at buenos aires. the final chapter serves as more of a coda, depicting rico aboard the rodger young as the lieutenant in command of rico's roughnecks, preparing to drop to klendathu as part of a major strike, his father being his senior sergeant and a native american third lieutenant-in-training (james bearpaw, known as "jimmie") of his own under instruction. ||| 5 ||| 5
in the aftermath of the battle of dantooine in the previous novel, the new republic is taking the yuuzhan vong threat more seriously. but so are the jedi, most notably a rogue one named daeshara'cor, whose lover, miko reglia, had perished during the second battle of helska back in vector prime. therefore, she elects to travel the galaxy to find a way to construct a super weapon to equal the power of the death stars, the eye of palpatine and sun crusher among others in order to eliminate the vong. knowing that such a genocidal ambition, even against an aggressively violent species, would lead a jedi down the path of the dark side of the force, luke skywalker and anakin solo decide to find daeshara'cor and bring her back to the order. with help from a man named chalco, they succeed in retrieving daeshara'cor and bringing her to her senses. in order to rally military support for the new republic to counter the yuuzhan vong, the government sends leia organa solo to negotiate with grand admiral gilad pellaeon, leader of the imperial remnant. pellaeon agrees to help the new republic combat the vong. caamasi new republic senator elegos a'kla decides to allow himself to be taken by the yuuzhan vong so that by learning about their culture, he can find a way to bring peace between the new republic and the vong. he is taken to commander shedao shai to learn of their ways. corran horn, ganner rhysode, and jacen solo embark on a mission on the vong-held planet of garqi with a group of noghri commandos. when they battle vong forces down on the planet, they find that the warriors die off because of a certain pollen that asphyxiates their armor. the jedi and commandos learn that the pollen is native to the bafforr trees on the planet ithor. corran decides for the pollen to be burned, because if the yuuzhan vong figure out about the pollen that can asphyxiate their armor, they will invade ithor as their next target. despite the burning, the vong figure out the source of what asphyxiated their armor anyway and elect to target ithor. during the investigation of the garqi battle, which shedao shai is leading, the vong figure out that corran horn was among the jedi in the strike force. after shai figures out that corran was the one who was responsible for the deaths of his kinsmen in the previous novel on bimmiel, he also figures out that corran and elegos a'kla are friends. therefore, he decides to kill elegos and sends his jewel-decorated remains to corran to acknowledge their blood feud. corran vows to avenge elegos's death at all costs. the new republic, imperial remnant, and by extension the chiss ascendancy rendezvous at ithor to protect the planet against the invading vong. the battle of ithor commences, with many dying on both sides, until it is later halted by corran when he makes use of a vong villip to contact shedao shai. they agree to stop the war for at least a galactic standard week, and by the end of that week, corran and shai will engage in a death duel to determine the fate of ithor; if corran wins, ithor is spared; if shai wins, ithor is destroyed and he collects the remains of his slain kinsmen that corran and ganner took from bimmiel. during this break in the war, anakin visits daeshara'cor at one of ithor's hospitals, since she was mortally wounded in the battle; and it was because she had decided to save anakin from an imminent vong attack. daeshara'cor tells anakin that it wasn't his fault that she will die, just as it wasn't his fault that chewbacca perished on sernpidal, since he blamed himself because he flew the millennium falcon off to save everyone aboard. with that, daeshara'cor dies and fades away into the force. by the end of the week, corran and shai duel, and corran wins by stabbing his vong opponent with his lightsaber, killing him. shai's personal assistant, deign lian, who bore witness to the battle for shai just as luke skywalker bore witness to the duel for corran, agrees to tell the yuuzhan vong to leave ithor alone. however, when he takes control of the forces in shai's stead, he orders for the planet to be poisoned under command from the warrior caste's leader warmaster tsavong lah. in retaliation, the new republic, imperial remnant and chiss forces decimate the remainder of the vong forces left in the battle. but it is too late; ithor is gone. in the aftermath of the battle of ithor, the yuuzhan vong, despite their defeat, expand their forces to include more of the outer rim territories. the new republic, imperial remnant and chiss alliance dissolves. and corran is called the destroyer of ithor by the new republic, despite his attempts to save the planet. therefore, corran elects to go into a self-imposed exile to his home planet of corellia, since his guilt was more out of the fact that he felt himself plunge into the dark side of the force briefly when he killed shai in retaliation for elegos a'kla's death. he then tells those around him at his announcement of his self-imposed exile that, if the new republic should ever call upon the killer of ithor to help them counter the yuuzhan vong, then the war will truly have gone out of control for the side of good. ||| 5 ||| 5

the physicists in coombs's lab become obsessed with lack, which appears to have its own personality and preferences. alice develops a personal relationship with the artificial intelligence that they have created, while philip becomes jealous of their relationship. philip begins to get involved after b-84, a laboratory animal (cat) enters lack. this consumption of b-84 causes a campus wide protest. in an attempt to impress alice, philip breaks up the protest by giving a speech about how a single cat being destroyed is minimal and their efforts would better spent on larger problems in the world. instead of impressing alice, she becomes defensive of lack and locks herself in its chamber. after a night of drinking, philip comes back to his apartment to see that dr. soft has brought alice there. she is asleep but dr. soft suspects that she may have tried to enter lack and that she is no longer capable of running experiments on lack. this causes dr. soft to divide lack's time up among capable people. he does not want to interrupt alice's research so he gives her time but asks philip to monitor her. he also claims a portion of lack's time for himself, his graduate students, and an italian physics team headed by carmo braxia. later on philip also gets dr. de tooth to also have his part in studying lack. despite all of the new people studying lack, still very little progress is being made both on the grounds of explaining lack and in restoring philip and alice's relationship. the undergraduates build a device out of only things lack consumes and try to feed it to lack but lack refuses it. alice tries to give lack pictures of herself but even those are refused. de tooth tries to enter lack himself and fails. even the italian physicist seem to be lost, that is until braxia tells philip his theory. he claims lack is a new universe that doesn't have intelligent life. he says that because of the strong anthropic principle, a universe cannot exist if there isn't conscious life to observe it. since lack does not contain any conscious life it clings to the our reality that does. the personality it developed was that of the first conscious person it encountered, alice. what it absorbed was what she liked. with his new knowledge, and in a state of drunkenness, philip sets out to be the first lover in history to ever have a definitive answer as to whether or not he is loved back. he enters lacks chamber and slides himself into lack. he wakes up the next morning realizing he is no longer in the universe he was the night before.the ground was ball bearings and wool, buildings were made of clay and bowling shoe leather, and the fountain at the entrance of campus was made of aluminum foil and was filled with pistachio ice cream. after retrieving b-84 as proof of the universe, philip heads back to lack and climbs in. this time however, instead of going back to reality as he expected, he entered a new universe that had no light. evan and garth, two blind men who had also climbed into lack, helped him once again climb into lack but this time instead of entering a new universe he merges and becomes one with lack. the novel deals thematically with many of the philosophical issues pertaining to modern quantum physics, as well as human interaction with artificial intelligence. ||| 5 ||| 5

friend and amy's brother randall. she finds out that randall has joined the united states marine corps and is going to sea. they attend a religious revival at the farm, where jacky sees her old associates mr. fennel and mr. bean, who are stage performers. they are putting on the show with a girl that jacky discovers to be polly von, a former member of jacky's gang in cheapside. when jacky sails into london she is taken to newgate prison by her old enemies, bliffil and flashby. jacky goes before the court and is sentenced to life at the penal colony in australia. to make matters worse, the lorelei lee is confiscated and used to transport jacky and 250 other female convicts, to become "breeders" to populate australia. jacky had decked out the lorelei lee to carry passengers across the atlantic ocean, so it was equipped for the voyage to australia. the lorelei has three levels of open hammock spaces and jacky, knowing which level is best, claims the top level of hammocks for her and her new crew of girls. four groups form on the ship, the lizzies, the judies, and the tartans, named after their leaders, and jacky's group, called the newgaters crew, which includes mary wade and esther abrahams. captain laughton tells the girls that after they reach gibraltar the different hammock levels will be auctioned off. the other three crews, being prostitutes, plan on making their money that way. the newgaters crew, consisting of twelve girls, including jacky, plan on doing the ship's laundry in an attempt to make money. captain laughton also tells the girls and the crew that they are welcome to mingle and get together. the captain gets more money if, when they arrive in australia, any girls are pregnant or have had a child, so they are welcome to it, and they will get a shilling in return. meanwhile, the book switches to letters from jaimy to jacky. the letters do not reach jacky, but it tells the reader what has happened to jaimy. jaimy has been convicted of defrauding the king and sentenced to seven years in the penal colony of australia. jaimy has been told by the prison guards that jacky has not been hanged and has been sent to australia. the father and brother confirm this and jaimy is put on the ship to australia. on the ship, jaimy finds ian mcconnaughey and arthur mcbride, from jacky's former ship the emerald, as well as other members of the former crew. the lorelei lee arrives in gibraltar. they ship is to be there for three days and the other crews go on with their profession to make money to be able to buy the good levels of hammocks. the next day, jacky goes onto the dock in her swim suit. she invites people to throw coins into the water, which she will retrieve. she works the docks all day, though not making nearly as much as the other crews. later jacky sees that the ship is taking on a few more girls and that one of them is mairead. mairead has been sentenced to life in australia as well. mairead tells her of her arrest and the fact that she is pregnant. as jacky continues to dive for coins she sees some old seamates from the ship wolverine. she also sees gully macfarland, her old partner in boston, who jacky put upon a british navy ship after he got drunk and hit her. he tells her he is now sober and she is the reason, which he is thankful for. after the lorelei lee leaves gibraltar the captain auctions off the hammock spaces to the four different crews. the three other crews outbid jacky and her crew for the best hammock spaces. however, this was jacky's plan all along. jacky and her crew make the laundry room their home. jacky, being the former owner of the lorelei lee, knows where the extra mattresses are, and with some help from the carpenter, they make bunk beds for the crew. as the ship sails on, the captain begins to have dinner parties in his cabin, with the officers attending. jacky is there too, being the entertainment. during these parties major george johnston, an officer, has been attending with a girl from jacky's crew, esther abrahams. at one of the dinners they announce their engagement and the next day they are married. after the wedding the captain pushes higgins to take a girl for himself. higgins takes this opportunity to protect himself as well as jacky by taking her as his wife. the first mate mr. ruger has been coming on to jacky and by marrying higgins, she can somewhat ward off his advances. jacky on the other hand, uses their marriage to tease higgins to no end by asking him to carry her across the threshold of their cabin and calling him "dear husband john" and such. that night, as jacky and higgins jump on the bed and make noises to make their marriage look, if not sound, real, she jokingly slides her hands down his waist and asks him if he would want her to, being legally married and all. they both have a laugh over this and fall asleep. the ship then makes it to india. jacky and mairead go out to explore india with higgins and captain laughton. jacky and mairead get separated from the others. a small boy named ravi offers to be their tour guide. ravi is part of the untouchable caste and is an orphan after his mother died. ravi shows them around, exchanges their money. the girls are sticking out so ravi uses their money to buy them indian clothing. he shows them the different indian gods, including the goddess kali and the god ganesh. after the girls eat some indian food they are able to ride an elephant. riding the elephant, jacky and mairead go on to be part of a procession through town, where at the end, in the governor's box, sit captain laughton and higgins. jacky decides to joke around. while on the elephant, jacky stands in front of mairead and puts her arms out, imitating the goddess kali. this outrages the kali followers, and they chase jacky and mairead. they run, led by ravi. he gets them to the ship so they will be safe. jacky knows if ravi is left behind the kali followers will kill him for helping her, so she grabs him and puts ravi on the ship. the captain is outraged when the ship is asked to leave the port immediately. the book then switches to a letter from jaimy to jacky. the letter is not written down, but rather in his head. jaimy and the others are on the ship cerberus. every day, the convicts are allowed on deck for some exercise and fresh air. jaimy plans a riot. ian and arthur create a diversion by singing a song about some of the guards. the two guards, corporal vance and sergeant napper, are enraged and begin beating some of the convicts. this diversion allows jaimy to grab a belaying pin from the deck and tuck it under his clothes. the weeks go by on the lorelei lee. one day a fight breaks out between two girls, violetta atkins and jane wheelden. they were fighting over a man. jacky tries to break up the fight and ends up in the middle of it. fighting is forbidden on the ship and is punishable by whipping. however, this time mr. ruger decides to punish the girls by rigging up the dunking stool, where the girls will be dunked into the sea for ten seconds. jacky knows the other two girls would not be able to take the punishment and takes it for them, meaning she would be underwater for 30 seconds. as jacky is dunked underwater she counts the seconds. she soon realizes that she is being kept longer than she should. jacky soon passes out and wakes up on the deck. higgins tells her that something was caught in the winch to reel up the rope. higgins thinks it was a knitting needle. mrs. barnsley, mrs. macdonald, and mrs. berry are the leaders of the other crews, and don't like jacky very much. however, they come to higgins and tell them that even though they haven't gotten along with jacky, they did not try to harm her. just then ravi comes in to inform jacky of an arriving ship. all the women come on deck to see the ship cerberus. while the captains exchange news and try to trade passengers, jacky spots her old irish crew on the ship. jacky continues to spot more of her old crew, including mairead's husband, ian. mairead yells to ian and the crew yells back. mcbride, seeing jacky yells, "fletcher, it's your jacky." the two girls are at the edge of the ship, and are being held back from jumping off. the captain tells them they are inflicting punishment to rioting prisoners, and jacky and mairead, seeing that their jaimy and ian are being hurt, manage to jump on board the cerberus to save/comfort their men. the guards force jacky to watch as jaimy is beaten, doing the same for mairead and ian. but afterwards as jacky is kissing jaimy (who is nearing unconsciousness), she slyly puts her shiv in his boot. the captain throws the girls over and sails off. back on the lorelei lee, the girls continue to travel, all while first mate ruger continues to eye jacky and mairead. one day, while partying on the deck the captain, obviously drunk, yells for more everything and just dies, his last word being, "more." with ruger as captain, everyone stays below as much as possible. he drinks himself into a frenzy and brutally abuses anyone in his way. he continues to pursue jacky and mairead. all the gangs decide to form a truce with each other as well as the other ship officers to keep everyone safe from ruger. meanwhile the boys plan to hijack the cerberus, sail to the nearest port, supply themselves, and sail to australia to save their girls. their opportunity arrives when the crew is drunk during the captain's birthday and their escort ship is off to escort a more important ship. they manage to steal a club and considerable amount of rope and plot to start their take over the next night. when the guards walk by, mcbride starts telling a rather nasty joke involving jacky, himself, and jaimy. jaimy, pissed off, tells arthur the two will settle scores later. the next night, padric and ian tease weisling, their guard, about how he got beat up by jacky on the wolverine. they make up a song to an irish drinking tune about his embarrassment, and soon the weasel unlocks the door to beat them, but duggan puts out the weasel with their stolen belaying pin. they unchain themselves with the weasel's keys and wait for the other two guards to come out. the other two guards walk by and young daniel connolly begs them for protection from his bigger and meaner cell mates. they guards decide to unlock him to have some fun with him themselves (they mean to rape him), when jaimy and mcbride kill both of them. the men steal the guards' uniforms, raid the ship's weaponry, and go out killing and injuring most of the other guards, throwing them overboard in a life raft. they gain full control of the ship and set sail for batavia (jakarta). jaimy and mcbride see this as a perfect time to settle their scores and get into a fight. jaimy wins, claims captain and appoints his officers. ian as first mate, padric as second, and mcbride as third. meanwhile, ruger finally decides that he has waited long enough and orders jacky to his room. she refuses, telling him that she is married, and if he forces her, it will be rape. ruger tells her he knows of her sham marriage and this time orders both jacky and mairead to his room. mairead tells him to back away and that she has a baby. jacky tries to save her by telling ruger he can have her, and leave mairead alone, but he does not. ruger, angered, punches mairead in her stomach, killing her baby. he goes back into his cabin while the other women help mairead recover. jacky, angered, shoots ruger with an arrow, but misses as he ducks and runs away. to keep the officers from killing jacky for attempted murder, most of the women barricade themselves below the ship, and only will let officers pass for supplies if they agree to keep to their terms of truce. under deck, jacky and higgins make themselves a makeshift room for the two and discuss matters with ravi and their monkey josephine, who they picked up from india. higgins tells her it is unlikely that ruger will be convicted of anything, while she might be hanged for attempted murder. jacky dimly sees that her only hope is if jaimy helps her, which is unlikely. just then, a ship has been spotted and jacky runs up to see if it is jaimy. the ship turns out to be a pirate's chinese junk and attacks them by throwing phosphorus rockets at them from a long distance. deciding that she must fight fire with fire, and that no one should hurt the ship she paid for, she takes a few of her own arrows, as well as some flaming pitch, and drops down in a life boat with ravi to defend her lorelei lee. she manages to set fire to the junk's sails, which burn quickly as they are made of straw-like material. but, as she finishes off their sails, the chinese shoot their arrows at her and manage to take her and ravi captive. on board, a woman stops her execution, and her words are translated to jacky by an italian monk. the woman, whose name is cheng shih, is obviously the boss, asks the monk to record jacky's entire life. the monk and jacky talk and eventually she learns that cheng shih is the most dreaded pirate in these lands and commanded hundred of ships. the monk mocks her, as she was proud only a minute ago by having command of two ships in her days as a pirate. the monk, brother arcangelo rossetti, tells jacky that cheng shih is intrigued by her and wants to keep her. when meeting cheng shih in her cabin, she tells jacky that she does not believe her story. jacky, miffed at this, shows her how she can dive for coins. she takes all her clothes off and jumps into the water, quickly getting the coin, but staying down long enough to think her drowned. she swims around the ship, jumps on deck, surprising cheng shih. impressed by jacky's ability, the pirate takes jacky under her wing, dressing her in all the latest chinese fashions, and treating her as a pet. the book goes back to jaimy who is stuck in the middle of the ocean and cannot go anywhere as the wind will not blow. he is fearful of chinese pirates that scout out his ship daily. later in cheng shih's cabin, jacky learns of how she always keeps a buddha statue near her to remind herself of a debt unpaid. it turns out while raiding the monastery there, cheng shih also tried to take their giant golden buddha statue, but it sank under water. seeing all the monks dive after it and drowning, she vowed to bring it back up. but no amount of tugging would do the job. she marked the water there and left, failing in her task. hearing this, jacky thinks of how her diving bell managed to help her pull up the bow of a sunken spanish ship, and the next morning proposes to bring the statue back up, if she, jaimy, and the passengers of the lorelei lee (as well as the ship) are all freed. cheng shih is angry and whips jacky for even thinking of asking for freedom, but agrees to let everyone go except jacky. to show jacky that she is under the ownership and protection of her, cheng shih orders her assistant to tattoo on her neck a golden dragon, this being shih's mark. they immediately change course and sail toward the cerberus, their plan to take over the ship and sail to the lorelei lee. it is unknown to them that jaimy has managed to take command of the vessel. they come closer to the unarmed ship, and are about to fire when jacky sees that management has changed. she climbs aboard, stopping the slaughter, and tells jaimy to throw down his sword. when he does, she tells him about her plan, and together the two ships sail toward the lorelei lee. while together, jacky and jaimy spend a lot of time with each other, much to the displeasure of cheng shih. one such occasion includes a very saucy time in a bathtub. there, jaimy realizes that jacky is a sort of slave to the pirate and is angered. he demands jacky to sneak off with him, as he is afraid she will be used as a prostitute. jacky comforts him, and quickly changes the subject and asks jaimy what his plan is for the prisoners. he tells her that he will pose as the now-dead captain of the ship, collect the money for delivering the prisoners and sail back with her. she tells him that it is a great plan, but does not mention that she cannot leave. jaimy asks about her marriage to higgins, and jacky starts to tell him it is a sham, but jaimy stops her saying that he could never be jealous of their good friend higgins. jacky is sure he thinks she is no longer a maiden and wants to tell him that she is, but says nothing to make sure he would still love her any way she was. when they reach the lorelei lee, they board the ship and ian kills captain ruger for killing his unborn son, and laying his hands on mairead. everyone has a happy reunion and they all sail towards the sunken buddha. higgins and jacky have a talk about their marriage, and agree to get a divorce. higgins can see that jacky is anxious to be back with jaimy, so the two get divorced in the quick muslim way, since they are close to muslim waters. the crew sets up the diving bell, and jacky, donning her swimsuit, dives for the statue. she brings it up in no time and the chinese fix it to its original place. but in the process chi-chi (cheng shih's assistant) falls into the water. jacky saves him, making him her assistant. as they sail back, jaimy and jacky have to say goodbye. jaimy is outraged and wants to fight the pirates, as he cannot believe that they are keeping his jacky as a slave. jacky tells him that she is treated well, like a pet, and he should not worry, as she will have lots of adventures around asia, and that adventure was why she got on the dolphin years ago. she tells him to go back to australia, continue with his plan and to start a life elsewhere without her. jacky begins to cry, and when jaimy tries to hug her she tells him not to, as shih is watching and will kill them both. jaimy protests saying that he will fight them all for her freedom, but she tells him to leave. she asks cheng shih if she can kiss jaimy one last time, but the pirate says no. jacky's heart breaks at how she will never be able to feel jaimy again and sobs into her hands. the monk quickly explains that cheng shih meant that she would not allow jacky to stay, and that she wants jacky to leave with her fiance as she would hate her golden child to feel so sad. not wanting to wait as cheng shih might change her mind, the two run off the ship, quickly climb their ships and set sail to australia. on route to australia, jacky and jaimy are mostly on separate ships, and she makes no move to invite him over, telling him she is busy. in reality, she just wanted to distance herself from him, as she did not feel ready for sex. she had known that would be on jaimy's mind, as mairead and ian had been "busy making another irish baby" and mcbride had given him a hard time about her easy ways. at australia, jaimy and higgins act as the captains of the two ships, collect the money, leave the prisoners, and sail a good distance away to talk matters through. jaimy and jacky, now finally alone, begin talking. she tells him to sail to singapore and spend every cent of his money to arm his ship. jaimy is confused as he thought that this would be the perfect time for him and jacky to make up for lost time in their relationship, but he goes, with only a few kisses from his fiance. she later has a talk with higgins, just like the one on the nancy b., but this time she agrees with higgins, admitting that getting married and having children could wait until she was older and more successful. higgins smiles quietly, and it is obvious he knew she would say this. a few days after the ships separate, the dart (the cerberus 's companion ship) returns from its different duty to find and sail with it back to england. the captain climbs aboard the lorelei and jacky sees that it is joseph jared, one of the men she had a relationship with on the wolverine, as since then. he tells her that he has finally met her after what seemed like forever. he technically has authority over her, as she is an escaped prisoner, and he wants her in bed. she says no politely and persists, but jared pulls her onto the bed anyway. just then the cerberus pulls up, with jaimy jumping aboard and jacky smiles and asks jared, "now who exactly is the prisoner of whom?" the three captains discuss what to do with their illegal profits, the ships, and where to stay, as both jacky and jaimy are wanted. jared insists that it is his duty to turn in jacky and jaimy (he is still angry from jacky's refusal, and the fact that jaimy is actually present this time to stop him from getting his way with jacky), but seeing the others' expressions and their armed guards, he quickly agrees that he is open for discussion. together, they agree to let the dart sail with them to england, where the cerberus and it will stay, and where jaimy will go with his lawyer to plead his innocence in court. jared, now a captain, will vouch for him with his influence. jacky, along with the irish crew and higgins, would go to boston, and continue with faber shipping, as all chances of her acquittal is lost. the three shake hands and are about to continue with the matter of the money, when chi-chi yells, warning them of a typhoon. the book ends with jacky panicking about the fast approaching storm. ||| 7 ||| 0
adrian monk and natalie teeger take julie to the hospital after she breaks her wrist during a soccer game, though before they leave, monk gives the other parents the satisfaction of exposing the other team's coach as a murderer. at the hospital, monk is stunned when he sees his old assistant sharona fleming working as a nurse. she explains that after leaving monk's employ to re-marry her ex-husband, trevor howe, and move to new jersey, a friend of trevor's from los angeles who owned a landscaping business sold his business to trevor. they moved to los angeles and took over the business. however, recently, when one of his clients, a professor named ellen cole, was found bludgeoned to death with a lamp in her house. trevor has been accused of the murder, and sharona has no trouble believing it, so she and benjy have moved back up to san francisco, with benjy currently staying with sharona's sister gail. sharona doesn't hide the fact that she'd like her old job with monk back, and before long there is open hostility between her and natalie. to save her job, she works out a compromise: they will travel to los angeles so that monk can see if trevor is really guilty. monk, natalie and sharona drive to los angeles, arriving by nightfall. they meet lieutenant sam dozier of the los angeles police department at an antiques store robbery. here, monk (wearing a gas mask due to the smog) exposes the owner's wife as the killer. they then travel to ellen cole's house. monk examines the scene and concludes (somewhat to his own regret), that trevor is innocent. he notices several clues that suggest that ellen cole's killer was waiting for her, meaning that the murder was premeditated. however, dozier informs monk that jewelry from trevor's clients was found in his truck, and sharona dismisses this as not being enough to arrest trevor - after all, it's not too difficult to commit identity theft and open an account in the name of someone else. they go on to question some of the people closest to the victim, on the chance that one of them might be the real killer (with monk also busting one of them for shoplifting). later, monk, natalie and sharona head down to a bookstore to question the person who found the evidence to "convict" trevor, lapd consultant ian ludlow, who is also a prolific mystery author (he is a household name everywhere, writing his detective marshak stories and publishing a new one every 90 days). he mentions the damning evidence, although monk refuses to believe it. while they are at the bookstore, natalie buys a few of ludlow's titles, including his latest, death is the last word. the saleswoman at the bookstore mentions that ludlow has a compulsion - he can't pass a store without signing his own books, and today, unsigned ludlow titles are more valuable than signed books. sharona remains behind in los angeles, intending to do some asking around about ellen cole, while monk and natalie head back to san francisco. during the drive, monk flips through the ludlow titles and quickly solves the mysteries in the books after only reading the first few pages. natalie berates him for ruining the plots, but monk remarks that there's really no point to reading his books: after all, in san francisco, he solves a lot of cases that are usually a lot more interesting and complicated than what ludlow can conjure. not to mention, ludlow has a certain key aspect present throughout his titles - the killer is always the least likely suspect who is betrayed by a personality quirk. while monk and natalie have been away, julie has been staying with benjy. she remarks that they seem to have way too many similarities (including having lost a father), and doesn't want to become identical to him at any point soon. the next few days go by with no incidents, as monk recuperates from the smog in los angeles. natalie briefly has a run in with joseph cochran, a firefighter she dated briefly during a different homicide investigation. cochran informs natalie that he needs monk's help again - this time, on a property theft. it seems that someone has stolen his fire company's hydraulic rescue equipment. that friday, when natalie is leaving the house, her car starts leaking oil and she is forced to rent a toyota corolla while her jeep grand cherokee goes into the shop for repairs. later that day, monk and natalie meet captain stottlemeyer and lieutenant disher at a crime scene on baker beach. monk has to face his issues with nudists as he is led to the crime scene. they are shown the crime scene, which stottlemeyer mentions as possibly being a crime scene but at the same time is possibly not one: a 37 year old shoe salesman by the name of ronald webster has been found brutally mauled to death, and his midsection has been ripped open. the medical examiner has determined the approximate time of death to be some time the night before, but they can't be more precise, given the body's immersion in the water. monk learns that this was probably not a robbery, as webster's wallet is still in his pocket, as are his car and house keys. he also learns that the victim's car is not in the nearby parking lot. randy theorizes that webster came out skinny dipping with a special friend, who may have been washed away, however, this turns out to be an unlikely lead. at monk's request, the medical examiner turns webster's body over, and he mentions that drowning is the likely cause of death. the wounds on his body, while still extremely painful, are not fatal, and they appear to have been made by a creature of some sort. after randy makes several wild guesses about what kind of animal could make a bite like the one on the body, (his guesses getting more bizarre until he guessses that a clam is responsible) monk dismisses him and tells all that the animal that did this was an alligator. he points out that all of the teeth marks are identical, as alligators have teeth that are all perfectly identical. the medical examiner points out to monk that alligators are not indigenous to san francisco, but an alligator may have been responsible - after all, alligators kill their prey by grabbing them with their mouths, and then holding them underwater until they drown, and the pattern of injuries is consistent with this theory. monk, natalie, stottlemeyer and disher are all convinced that this is a rather cleverly committed homicide. with stottlemeyer unable to mobilize a homicide task force with the san francisco police department until the medical examiner completes his autopsy, monk and natalie ask around to see if there might be anything that would explain why ronald webster was killed in a rather bizarre fashion. they go to the shoe store where webster worked, and question some of his fellow employees. coincidentally, it seems that the store is in natalie's neighborhood. they talk to one of his fellow employees, who tells them that webster lived a very dull life, and also mentions that his priest is the only person who'd know more about him. leaving the store, monk mentions to natalie that as ronald webster lived a rather quiet life, the theory that the alligator attack was premeditated homicide looks more compelling - for one thing, skinny dipping wasn't something that fit his personality. also, his car was never found near the crime scene, and monk figures that they'll find webster's buick lucerne either near his house or near the store. monk deduces that the crime scene at the beach was entirely staged, and webster had to have been killed somewhere else. the next day, monk and natalie head to mission dolores, a few blocks away, and speak to father bowen, webster's priest. in questioning, he tells them that webster attended mass every day. monk figures that webster had done something worth feeling very guilty about that caused him to attend daily mass. bowen mentions that a few years ago, webster hit a woman with his car and he fled the scene. he felt so guilty about the incident that he started attending church to pay for what he did. natalie quickly calls disher to ask for a check on the victim that ronald webster hit. their next stop is the office of dr. paula dalmas, a dentist in walnut creek, and the woman that webster had hit with his car. questioning dr. dalmas, they learn that webster has been sending money to her anonymously for a while, and had been following her for years. she mentions that she had to undergo quite a lot of surgery after the hit-and-run, including hip surgery and facial surgery, and has lost the ability to reproduce. monk quickly figures that dr. dalmas is a dead end - she was left with permanent injuries after the hit-and-run, and as such has made it her job to fix other peoples' teeth. also, she has an alibi for the night of the murder. as monk and natalie return to san francisco, stottlemeyer calls to inform them that the medical examiner has completed his report and wants them down at the morgue. when they arrive at the morgue, they find stottlemeyer and disher waiting for them, as well as ian ludlow himself. ludlow admits that randy called him in, and that randy was one of his top students when he was teaching a class on mystery writing at berkeley, during the 2007 sfpd police strike. monk, natalie, stottlemeyer, disher, ludlow and the medical examiner all look at webster's body. the bite does appear to have been made by an alligator, judging by the amount of force per square inch applied. at the same time though, the medical examiner mentions that there are traces of bath water and bath salts in the body, suggesting he drowned in his bathtub, which only makes things more complicated. natalie asks if it is easy to fake an alligator bite, and learns that it is actually more difficult than one thinks: you have to get the right amount of force per square inch, and if there are no signs of a struggle, it's a dead giveaway. ludlow mentions that one of his characters in death is the last word actually tried faking an alligator bite with a bear trap with no success. for obvious reasons, monk is unhappy with ludlow's presence, and dismisses some of the crucial clues ludlow has found, such as the fact that webster had his last meal (a few slices of pizza) less than an hour before he was killed. they decide to check out ronald webster's loft apartment. as they arrive, stottlemeyer points out that the building he lived in was recently converted from an old warehouse, and webster was the only occupant the building - so if he was killed here, no one would have heard anything like the sounds of a struggle. monk examines the scene and notices streaks on the floor, some hydraulic fluid, and a drop of blood in the bathtub - clues that suggest that this is where webster was killed. he also notices that their killer apparently was very messy and left behind basically everything except a name and a phone number, and is somewhat confused - why would someone who'd killed a guy in a very clever way suddenly become so messy? monk also notices that the victim was a fan of ludlow's books, judging by the fact that he has all but the latest title on his bookshelf. they also find a pizza box from sorrento's with a receipt dated to thursday night, and natalie begins to wonder if she and julie came very close to encountering webster or spotted him and never recognized him. while they are investigating the apartment, natalie gets a call from joe cochran. monk quickly figures out who the caller is, and learning about the theft that happened at joe's firehouse, he insists on checking it out. monk and natalie head down to joe's firehouse where they meet joe and fire captain mantooth, who is pleased to meet monk again. they explain to monk that on wednesday night, earlier in the week, at around 9:00 pm, their crew was called away to a car fire in washington square. someone had blown up a painter's van (the arson investigators have ruled it arson, having discovered that someone stuffed rags into the van's fuel tank). monk quickly figures that the arsonist who did it wanted to get a lot of attention. it took joe's crew at least two hours to fight the fire and clean up the rubble, and when they got back to their firehouse, they did their standard unloading procedure - cleaning the rig and doing an inventory check - and that's when they found that someone had stolen one of their jaws of life kits (the jaws themselves are designed as a spreader to help extricate people who are trapped in their cars in accidents). monk learns that the power unit stolen is powered by gasoline, and the jaws also have a cutting force of 18,000 pounds per square inch. with this, monk not only has figured out how ronald webster was killed, but he's also solved the case - and figured that webster's killer is the same person as ellen cole's killer, even though both crimes have different m.os (with ellen being bludgeoned and webster being mauled). unfortunately, he doesn't believe he can recover the gear that was stolen, and reluctantly tells joe and mantooth that the thief probably dumped the gear in the bay after he killed ronald webster. ronald webster's killer started the car fire to lure joe's fire company out of the firehouse for a long enough period of time that he could steal the jaws of life package. the killer then attached a set of alligator jaws to the inside of the spreader to make the alligator bite look authentic and also enable him to replicate the biting force of an alligator. the following night, the killer broke into webster's house, and knocked webster out. after stripping him of his clothes, he put the body in the bathtub and filled it up with water (which he then laced with table sea-salts). then the killer clamped the jaws down on webster, who must have regained consciousness and tried to fight back against his attacker, which explains the streaks monk found on the floor near the bathtub when he investigated the apartment. after webster was dead, the killer lugged the jaws of life and webster's body down to his car. after dumping webster's body and neatly folded clothes at baker beach, the killer drove somewhere else and threw the jaws into the water. the next morning, sharona shows up at monk's apartment, monk having called her the night before. stottlemeyer also shows up, and monk explains that he believes ludlow himself killed both ronald webster and ellen cole. he remembers how ludlow said to him that he hangs around with lieutenant dozier for a few days as he waits for an unusual murder to come along, but monk doesn't believe ludlow waits - he believes that ludlow befriends a random person he meets at a book signing, follows them for a while, kills them, finds out who is in their life, and then frames the least likely person for the crime. stottlemeyer, however, is not convinced, and believes that monk is personally jealous at the fact that ludlow is helping consult on the webster case. he dismisses what monk believes happened, apart from the m.o. for the fake alligator attack. however, minutes later stottlemeyer comes back and informs natalie and sharona that there has been some bad news. when they reach the street, they find that natalie's car has been towed, though natalie insists that she didn't park the car illegally. stottlemeyer points out that it wasn't his call, and he has monk, natalie and sharona accompany him to natalie's house. when they get to natalie's house, there is a heavy police presence outside. in the house, ludlow accuses natalie and sharona of committing the murders, accusing sharona of the ellen cole murder and natalie to ronald webster. he explains their motive as, on sharona's part, a desire to rid herself of her husband, and on natalie's part, a desire to get sharona out of the way and keep her job as monk's assistant. he accuses natalie of ordering an alligator jaw the day before the firehouse theft, though natalie points out that someone could have stolen her credit card number, ordered the jaws, then swiped them off her porch, and also claims that natalie snuck out of her house on the night of the theft to steal the jaws of life (though natalie protests this, claiming that she doesn't have a key to the firehouse). additionally, forensics has found evidence matching natalie's car to clues found in webster's apartment, making it clear that natalie's car was towed because forensics wanted to give it an analysis. as impossible as it sounds, the evidence is arranged in a compelling enough way that stottlemeyer has no choice but to arrest both women. to their horror, monk has nothing to add. the two women spend a night together in a holding cell, where they finally bond. sharona recognizes that natalie is a good fit for monk - which is no small validation, when natalie has been working in sharona's shadow for years. at the same time, sharona sadly advises her that natalie will never have a chance for her own life, or her own happiness, unless she can bring herself to abandon monk. the next day, the two women are brought in for interrogation. stottlemeyer asks the prison guards to release natalie and sharona from their handcuffs. sharona asks stottlemeyer if he's brought them in because he wants to apologize to them, but stottlemeyer points out that monk has caught a big break in the investigation and has found evidence that exonerates them. when they see monk, he is carrying a big grocery bag. he quickly mentions that ludlow killed ellen cole and ronald webster for little more reason than to create plot lines for his books, as ludlow can't create stories in time to meet his deadlines. the way ludlow works is like this: he befriends someone he meets at a book signing, then kills them, observes how events unfold, and then frames the least likely suspect for the crime. monk goes back through how ludlow committed the crimes, and then explains that the murder of ronald webster was about framing natalie and expanding his next book. he explains that the events leading up to webster's death began when natalie bought several of ludlow's titles in los angeles. monk figures that ludlow must have stolen natalie's credit card receipt and used the number on the receipt to order the alligator head and ship it to her house in san francisco with overnight shipping, and then he swiped the jaws off natalie's porch before natalie got home so that she never knew about the theft. ludlow mentions that there isn't any proof, but monk points out that ludlow, like most bad mystery writers, has his killers drop clues everywhere so that his detective can wrap everything up nice and tight. he added a few clues too many when he framed natalie. monk also reveals that natalie's relationship with joe cochran was one of the little surprises ludlow likes to discover when he commits these seemingly random killings. monk is starting to build a case, but ludlow points out to monk that all of the events described happened before he arrived in san francisco on that friday. at this, monk asks randy and confirms that he called ludlow's cell phone, so he couldn't know where ludlow actually was when he was contacted. ludlow claims he was in los angeles, but monk says he can prove ludlow was actually in san francisco. he presents a copy of a receipt from a pizza box he found in ronald webster's kitchen. it comes from sorrento's, the pizzeria in natalie's neighborhood. ludlow claims that the receipt can prove webster was in the restaurant at the same time that natalie was in there with julie, a few nights before the murder, and that he knows this because he is thorough in his investigation. monk tries to get ludlow to explain how he knows this, and ludlow claims that he knows webster, natalie and julie were all in sorrento's at the same time because webster saw the 10% discount advertised on julie's cast. however, monk points out that ludlow isn't explaining how he can know about the discount when he's never met julie, and reveals that ludlow actually had been in san francisco. additionally, monk explains that ludlow, like the killers of his own books, has been betrayed by a very hidden personality quirk. monk reveals that there is a bookstore across the street from sorrento's. after admitting that he had to wait until this morning to get the evidence (due to the store being closed on sundays), he pulls out a copy of death is the last word that he bought at that bookstore. ludlow asks if he should sign it, but monk shows the title page, which shows that he actually signed this copy of the book two days before webster was killed, several days before he claimed to have arrived in san francisco. monk mentions that that is ludlow's personality quirk: he can't pass a bookstore without signing his own books. he watched natalie and looked for just the right person to kill. ronald webster served to be the perfect victim. ludlow befriended him, killed him by clamping the stolen jaws of life on him, and then dumped his body at the beach. ludlow is arrested, and trevor - along with several other "murderers" in los angeles that were caught with ludlow's assistance - are set free. as they leave, monk admits to natalie and sharona that he would have arrested ludlow earlier if he hadn't been so ashamed of himself for his mistakes. he also apologizes for letting them down the day before, and monk points out that he was afraid of speaking up because he knew he would have tipped ludlow off to the fact that he was being considered a suspect, and if ludlow realized that monk had caught on to him, he'd go back and buy up his signed books, then destroy them. he reveals that ludlow also signed his stock at two other bookstores in san francisco - one in washington square and one out at baker beach. exonerated, sharona and natalie reunite with their families, and sharona prepares to return to los angeles with trevor and benjy, leaving monk in natalie's hands, and giving monk the loving goodbye she never said the last time. ||| 3 ||| 6
the plot of the novel takes place in four separate time periods. the bulk of the novel is contained in the 2675 and 2727 sections. queen jasmina of the lighthugger gnostic ascension wakes quaiche, a member of her crew, from reefersleep. she is disappointed with him; despite his promises that he would improve the crew's fortunes, he has not done so. in fact, many of systems he has explored were filled with extremely valuable artifacts which he failed to detect and were picked up by other ships. as such, she gives him one last chance. jasmina sends him to explore the star 107 piscium and its planets. his lover, morwenna, is sent with him in the scrimshaw suit, a sensory deprivation device which paralyzes and blinds its wearer until they remove it. on one of the moons of a gas giant he names haldora (which also seems to disappear every so often for a few fractions of a second), he discovers an alien bridge, whose automated defense system attacks him. he crashes and finds he does not have enough oxygen to survive until his shuttle returns from the other side of haldora. however, haldora vanishes and his radio signal reaches the shuttle, which races to save him at maximum acceleration, killing morwenna. on ararat, 23 years after the events of redemption ark, scorpio, a hyperpig, seeks out nevil clavain, who has left mainstream society, leaving scorpio in charge. scorpio seeks his aid in opening a capsule which has come down from space. also with him is vasko, a reasonably competent but naïve young man. they open the capsule and discover ana khouri. khouri informs the colony that humanity is now at war with the inhibitors. they are getting the relevant technology from aura, khouri's daughter, who has been modified by the hades matrix, an alien data repository. however, skade has kidnapped her from khouri's womb. clavain and scorpio lead a team who discover skade in her crashed ship, which has been attacked by the inhibitors, causing its cryo-arithmetic engines to malfunction and cover the ship in ice. skade agrees to give the colony aura in return for clavain's being tortured to death. clavain agrees, but tells scorpio to throw his corpse into the sea (where the pattern jugglers absorb him and reunite him with galiana and felka). the survivors are attacked by inhibitor machinery, but remontoire, a conjoiner leading the war, protects them from space. back in the colony, the leaders debate as to what to do next. they eventually decide to leave. meanwhile, captain brannigan of the lighthugger nostalgia for infinity has been preparing to do so. after some deliberation, some fourteen thousand of the over 150,000 colonists board the ship, and it leaves. in space they meet remontoire, who gives them aura's technology to defend themselves. the leaders debate whether or not to go to the moon hela (which aura suggests they do) or yellowstone, to help evacuate the planet. they decide to do the latter, but find they are too late; by the time they reach yellowstone (in 2698), it has been overrun. as the crew collect the last refugees attempting to escape the system, a minor mutiny breaks out amongst the upper echelons, in which scorpio's leadership is overturned and the other leaders take power as a group. this is due to scorpio electing to rescue the last refugees off a shuttle that had been contaminated by the inhibitors. after the final disputes are settled, the ship is redirected towards hela. rashmika els, a 17 year old girl, leaves her home on hela to search for her long-lost brother harbin, who left to join the cathedrals years before. the cathedrals were set up by quaiche after the 2615 timeline and constantly move across hela (making use of various propulsion systems, such as legs and tracks) to "observe" haldora and its disappearances (known as "vanishings"). it uses special indoctrinal viruses to maintain religious faith amongst its supporters, although certain areas, such as rashmika's town, are exempt. she joins one of the caravans, a massive vehicle composed of several smaller units, to get to the "permanent way", where the cathedrals can be found. she has the ability to tell whenever people are lying to her, which makes quaiche very interested in her. he uses false evidence to convince rashmika that harbin has become a supporter of the church. in fact he is dead. she arrives at quaiche's cathedral and begins working for him. in the cathedral she suffers nightmares about a race called the "shadows", who exist in a parallel brane to our own. their universe has been consumed by a rogue terraforming agent and they are trying to join rashmika's. they had showed the scuttlers, the long-extinct inhabitants of hela, how to build a machine that could bring them across. in return they would destroy the inhibitors. however, the inhibitors allegedly destroyed the scuttlers first. meanwhile, the nostalgia for infinity makes its presence known to hela and offers to protect it (quaiche has been asking various lighthuggers for protection). quaiche agrees and sends "delegates" onto the ship, who are actually soldiers. they attempt to take the ship, but the crew defeats them. quaiche holds khouri and vasko hostage, as well as rashmika (who is actually aura). he reveals he actually wants the ship to change hela's rotation with its engines to stop it spinning; this will permit him to keep watching haldora eternally, without the need for moving cathedrals. brannigan agrees and lands, but not before he deploys a cache weapon on haldora and destroys its exterior, revealing it to be the shadows' transport mechanism. quaiche and grelier (his right-hand man) leave with aura, but quaiche panics and dies falling from the shuttle, whilst grelier is killed by brannigan's hypometric weapon when he tries to hold aura hostage. the soldiers of the cathedrals overwhelm brannigan and destroy him. scorpio arrives and rescues aura, who suggests they take the scrimshaw suit (now a prison for the shadows' digital envoy), but scorpio advises against doing so; remontoire has shown him a shard of material from ararat, which matches similar ones found on hela. he believes that the race that made them also killed the scuttlers for talking to the shadows. they leave the scrimshaw suit and retreat as the cathedral is destroyed. as they walk away, khouri asks scorpio why he saved the shuttle in the yellowstone system and it is revealed that he saw her husband, fazil, was on the passenger manifest. the prologue and epilogue of the novel are both set in roughly 3125, four hundred years after the rest of the book. an unnamed woman and her guardian are standing on the surface of a pattern juggler planet which is being evacuated. the woman agrees with her guardian to spend one more hour before returning to their ship. she stares up towards the stars and has the machinery in her clothing magnify one of them, revealing it to be colored green. the epilogue reveals that the woman is in fact an older version of aura (with her "protector" being scorpio), reflecting on the events that happened after the battle on hela. scorpio turned out to be right; the race - known as the nestbuilders - that wiped out the scuttlers had been watching humanity and aided them. the nestbuilders advised humanity to hide with them between the stars, but the humans instead used nestbuilder weaponry to defeat the inhibitors and cleanse human space of them. however, in doing so, they created a greater problem: the so called "greenfly" machines, self-replicating terraformers programmed to destroy every object in a solar system and reorganize them into trillions of vegetation-filled habitats that orbited the star (behavior that is exactly the same as the threat described by the shadows). the inhibitors had kept them in check, but without the inhibitors, the greenfly are now out of control. nothing the humans or nestbuilders can do has stopped them. as such, humanity is evacuating towards the pleiades. aura reminisces on the decision she made not to invoke the shadows. she decides that, before she returns to the ship, she will swim with the pattern jugglers and warn the people they have assimilated about what is coming. she enters the ocean as the novel ends. more can be found out about the greenfly threat in the story "galactic north", available in the book of the same name. this story outlines the origins of the greenfly and charts their progress until the year 40 000, by which point they have spread to such an extent that humans are forced to abandon the milky way galaxy entirely. ||| 5 ||| 5
the book starts off with tandy the half-nymph being harassed by the nasty demon fiant while trying to sleep. she has the talent of throwing tantrums that can stun or destroy, but her talent is ineffective against the demon, so she decides to visit her father crombie at castle roogna to see if he can help. having no means of travel, however, she decides to catch a night mare to take her there. she succeeds, at the price of being battered, except the mare takes her to the good magician's castle instead, where she is admitted without challenges due to the difficulties she went through riding the mare. cut to a year later, we find smash the half-ogre traveling to the good magician humfrey seeking to solve a vague dissatisfaction about himself. using the best of his ogre qualities (strength and naive stupidity), plus his clumsy knowledge of human customs, as well as the occasional bright flash of human intelligence, he navigates his way into the magician's castle passing various obstacles such as a basilisk and a pond of firewater. once smash gains entrance, though, he forgets all about his question. magician humphrey gives him an answer anyway, telling him to travel to the ancestral ogres and take tandy with him, and guard her. on their travels, smash and tandy blunder into an eye queue vine, which embeds itself into smash's head and provides him with human intelligence so he converses in the human way instead of spouting simple ogre rhymes. he soon discovers that the vine also helps give him good ideas, as not all the problems he and tandy encounter can be bashed to pieces. after the vine, they encounter an assortment of females of various magical races each needing to fulfill a personal quest...a dryad who needs to protect her tree from woodsmen, wingless fairy john looking for her similarly incorrectly named counterpart to switch back, centaur chem, a longtime friend with the talent of magic mapping who wants to chart more of xanth, blythe brassie who wants to leave her hypnogourd homeworld to come to the real xanth, a mermaid looking for love, and others. unfortunately also during their travels, tandy gets trapped in the hypnogourd world and has her soul wrenched from her, though she is later freed by the others. smash enters back into the gourd and forages a deal with the world spokesperson (in the form of a coffin): smash will give his soul to the gourd under a 90-day lien in exchange for tandy's soul. he then has 90 days to find the dread night stallion, ruler of the gourd world, and negotiate to void the lien. as the travels continue, each female does find what she is looking for, eventually, although smash's strength saps out of him a little at a time as his soul is gradually recalled as the days pass. smash makes periodic forays into the gourd world, with the help of a magical and infinite ball of string to mark his way, in search of the night stallion, overcoming various world challenges, most of which require both his ogre strength and human intelligence to solve. finally, when only chem and tandy are left with smash, they come upon the dread elements region and face a flood in the water region that washes off the eye queue vine from smash's head, right before they enter the most dangerous void region. as they enter the void, they come to realize that they are trapped and must find a way to get out, which they can't do without smash's useful intelligence. smash, using the void's properties, manages to get his illusion of intelligence back (though at this point it is no longer illusory), and enter the gourd one last time, where he finally finds the night stallion and faces new challenges that require all his newfound human intelligence as well as his ogre strength and stubbornness to overcome. once smash conquers the night stallion's challenges and wins back his soul, he realizes his human side and falls in love with tandy, putting his own soul in jeopardy again in order to save her, but through another deal ends up with only half a soul and half his ogre strength. he finally does arrive at the home of the ancestral ogres but notes how stupid and ugly they really are and decides he does not want to stay with them, though when they threaten tandy he commits to fighting to save her. after tandy sacrifices her own soul mid-battle to save smash (giving him full ogre strength) so he can defeat the ancestral ogres, smash finally comes to true terms with his human side, even transforming himself into a human so he can make love to tandy properly. as smash and tandy journey home, they again run into demon fiant. as a man, smash is no match for the demon, but manages to transform back to ogre form and is able to defeat fiant permanently, though again his human intelligence is needed to win this battle. ru:огр! огр!

(first animal republic), a group once organized to tend the farm while the beans vacationed. many do not believe that freddy was in the big woods, including charles the rooster. :"'or is it, as some old legends tell, a bird with the head of a lion?...is its name, as simon says, the ignormus? no one knows.' :'if you just got up to tell us that you don’t know anything,' said old whibley...'you can sit down again. we knew that before.'" (p. 51) freddy dares charles to go into the big woods with him. charles is frightened, but his wife henrietta bullies him. the rooster and freddy arrive independently in the woods. freddy’s imagination turns a sighting of the rooster into a creature with a long snout and tail feathers. charles in turn mistakes the pig. after charles brags widely, they discover that they only saw one other. the animal’s bank is robbed, the ignormus is suspected. freddy disguises himself as a hunter, borrowing mr. bean’s shotgun. while investigating the old grismby house freddy fires at what he thinks is a snake, knocking himself out. when he revives the shotgun is missing. at the farm, the practical cow, mrs. wiggins modestly questions why such a terrible ignormus would not confront freddy.

(p.&nbsp;130) the bean farm is robbed, and missing items are found in freddy’s pigpen. freddy gets a report that animals are being threatened in the name of the ignormus. investigating, an extortion letter in familiar handwriting is found. jinx the cat is unimpressed with the pig’s deductions: :"'to the eye of the trained detective nothing is ever just what it seems to be.' :'what does that make you, then?' said the cat." (p. 160) suspiciously, walking the big woods road, seeking the letter writer, they once again meet simon. then a huge white shape with horns floats from the woods, and they flee. returning to the grimsby house, the missing shotgun is pointed at freddy and theodore from a window. retreating to the bridge where the animals are leaving goods extorted from them, they encounter charles talking with the ignormus’ small henchman. hidden, freddy mimics the henchman’s voice, insulting the rooster and sending him into a fighting fury. charles wins the fight (and gains the reputation that follows him through the rest of the series). they discover that the henchman is simon’s son just before he escapes. frightened animals are starting to leave the farm when freddy gives a speech pointing out that they are "deserting under fire". animal patriotism and fighting spirit are roused. a beetle volunteers to climb up the shotgun barrels to gnaw out the gunshot. f.a.r. president mrs. wiggins organizes her troops. charging the grimsby house, they are halted by simon. but he just has insults and seeks no compromise. the charge continues, the gun goes off, the gunpowder alone slightly injuring freddy. the house is overrun, but they only find simon and his gang. old whibley the owl reveals the final mystery, dropping on freddy the weighted bedsheet used to allow the "ignormus" to drift through air. mrs. bean is sympathetic about the rats' trials, and they accept her offer of hospitality, except simon, "i don’t want kind words, and i don’t deserve them." (p.&nbsp;278) the rest of the animals throw a party. but at the end, jinx observes that there will always be "ignormuses". ||| 0 ||| 0
contemporary narrative: dave rudman, a london taxi-driver, has a casual sexual encounter with a young woman named michelle brodie. the pair do not meet for another seven months until a heavily pregnant michelle arrives at dave's flat. they marry, and michelle gives birth to a boy, carl, but the marriage is unsuccessful, and michelle eventually files for divorce, after which she resumes an earlier relationship with the television producer cal devenish. dave descends into depression and increasingly unstable behaviour, and michelle forbids him contact with their son, carl. dave writes a book that consists partly of an account of cab-driving in london, and partly of a misogynistic rant against the alleged unfairness of divorce and child access legislation. he has a single copy of the book printed on metal plates and buries it in the garden of the house in hampstead where michelle lives with cal and carl. dave suffers a breakdown, and comes under the care of the psychiatrist anthony bohm. despite discovering that carl is actually cal's son, dave slowly recovers his sanity and, during a stay in hospital, forms a relationship with phyllis vance, the mother of steve, another patient. dave regrets the content of his book, and attempts to dig it up from the hampstead garden, but fails. dave moves into phyllis's cottage on the fringes of outer london and, under her guidance, writes a second book that repudiates the content of the first, and recommends a life based on tolerance and freedom. he mails the new book to carl, but shortly afterwards is confronted at the cottage by loan sharks to whom he is heavily indebted. dave brandishes a shotgun but is fatally injured in a struggle with the men, who arrange the scene to make the death look like suicide – an arrangement that is readily believed by phyllis and the police. carl and cal then place dave's second book in a metal film canister and bury it in their garden. future narrative: on the isolated island of ham, a tiny community ekes out an existence from the land, assisted by semi-intelligent pig-like creatures known as 'motos' that are unique to the island. the community lives according to the severely enforced religion of the country (known as 'ing') whereby men and women lead separate lives but share childcare in accordance with the dictates of the 'book of dave', which is regarded as a sacred text, but which is evidently the book written by dave rudman and buried in a hampstead garden some two thousand years earlier. a young male 'hamster', symun devush, explores a forbidden area of the island and emerges claiming that he has discovered a second book of dave that repudiates the tenets of the first. although symun's revelations are popular, and he is lauded throughout the country as a prophet, religious authorities from the reconstructed city of new london send a deposition that arrests symun on a charge of heresy (or 'flying') and transports him to new london, where he is physically and mentally broken, his tongue torn out, and returned to live in isolation on the desolate outcrop of land known as nimar, not far from ham. before being arrested, symun conceives a son, carl, who becomes an object of interest to antone böm, an exiled heretic. böm believes that the second book of dave discovered by symun may be buried on the island, but his search for the book is a failure. carl and böm travel to new london in order to determine the fate of symun and the second book but, soon after their arrival, the pair are arrested and sentenced to death. they escape, and discover symun's fate on nimar. upon returning to nimar, however, they find that symun has died, and that his belongings include no second book but only a metal container filled with rotten debris. they return to ham, where another delegation from new london is brutally mistreating the population and slaughtering the motos. as one of the hamsters rebels against the slaughter, carl and böm reveal themselves. ||| 5 ||| 2

sue trinder, an orphan raised in 'a fagin-like den of thieves' by her adoptive mother, mrs. sucksby, is sent to help richard 'gentleman' rivers seduce a wealthy heiress. posing as a maid, sue is to gain the trust of the lady, maud lilly, and eventually persuade her to elope with gentleman. once they are married, gentleman plans to commit maud to a madhouse and claim her fortune for himself. sue travels to briar, maud's secluded home in the country, where she lives a sheltered life under the care of her uncle, christopher lilly. like sue, maud was orphaned at birth; her mother died in a mental asylum, and she has never known her father. her uncle uses her as a secretary to assist him in compiling an index of erotica, and keeps her to the house, working with him in the silence of his library. sue and maud forge an unlikely friendship, which develops into a mutual physical passion; after a time, sue realizes she has fallen in love with maud, and begins to regret her involvement in gentleman's plot. deeply distressed, but feeling she has no choice, sue persuades maud to marry gentleman, and the trio flee from briar to a nearby church, where maud and gentleman are hastily married in a midnight ceremony. making a temporary home in a local cottage, and telling maud they are simply waiting for their affairs to be brought to order in london, gentleman and a reluctant sue make arrangements for maud to be committed to an asylum for the insane; her health has already waned as a result of the shock of leaving her quiet life at briar, to gentleman's delight. after a week, he and sue escort an oblivious maud to the asylum in a closed carriage. however, the doctors apprehend sue on arrival, and from the cold reactions of gentleman and the seemingly innocent maud, sue guesses that it is she who has been conned: "that bitch knew everything. she had been in on it from the start." in the second part of the novel, maud takes over the narrative. she describes her early life being raised by the nurses in the mental asylum where her mother died, and the sudden appearance of her uncle when she was eleven, who arrives to take her to briar to be his secretary. her induction into his rigid way of life is brutal; maud is made to wear gloves constantly to preserve the surfaces of the books she is working on, and is denied food when she tires of labouring with her uncle in his library. distressed, and missing her previous home, maud begins to demonstrate sadistic tendencies, biting and kicking her maid, agnes, and her abusive carer, mrs stiles. she harbours a deep resentment toward her mother for abandoning her, and starts holding her mother's locket every night, and whispering to it how much she hates her. shockingly, maud reveals that her uncle's work is not to compile a dictionary, but to assemble a bibliography of literary pornography, for the reference of future generations. in his own words, christopher lilly is a 'curator of poisons.' he introduces maud to the keeping of the books—-indexing them and such—-when she is barely twelve, and deadens her reactions to the shocking material. as she grows older, maud reads the material aloud for the appreciation of her uncle's colleagues. on one occasion, when asked by one of them how she can stand to curate such things, maud answers, "i was bred to the task, as servants are." she has resigned herself to a life serving her uncle's obscure ambition when richard rivers arrives at briar. he familiarises her with a plan to escape her exile in briar, a plan involving the deception of a commonplace girl who will believe she had been sent to briar to trick maud out of her inheritance. after initial hesitation, maud agrees to the plan and receives sue weeks later, pretending to know nothing about the plot. maud falls in love with sue over time and, like sue, begins to question whether she will be able to carry out gentleman's plot as planned. though overcome with guilt, maud does, and travels with gentleman to london after committing sue to the asylum, claiming to the doctors that sue was the mad mrs maud rivers who believed she was a commonplace girl. instead of taking maud to a house in chelsea, as he had promised, gentleman takes her to mrs sucksby in the borough. it was, it turns out, gentleman's plan to bring her here all along; and, mrs sucksby, who had orchestrated the entire plan, reveals to a stunned maud that a lady, marianne lilly, had come to lant street seventeen years earlier, pregnant and alone. when marianne discovered her cruel father and brother had found her, she begged mrs sucksby to take her newborn child and give her one of her 'farmed' infants to take its place. sue, it turns out, was marianne lilly's true daughter, and maud one of the many orphaned infants who had been placed on mrs sucksby's care after being abandoned. by the decree of marianne's will, written on the night of the switch, both girls were entitled to a share of marianne lilly's fortune. by having sue committed, mrs sucksby could intercept her share. she had planned the switch of the two girls for seventeen years, and enlisted the help of gentleman to bring maud to her in the weeks before her eighteenth birthday, when she would become legally entitled to the money. by setting sue up as the 'mad mrs rivers', gentleman could, by law, claim her fortune for himself. alone and friendless, maud has no choice but to remain a prisoner at lant street. she makes one attempt to escape to the home of one of her uncle's friends, mr hawtrey, but he turns her away, appalled at the scandal that she has fallen into, and anxious to preserve his local reputation. maud returns to lant street and finally submits to the care of mrs sucksby. it is then that mrs sucksby reveals to her that maud was not an orphan that she took into her care, as she and gentleman had told her, but mrs sucksby's own daughter. the novel resumes sue's narrative, picking up where maud and gentleman had left her in the mental asylum. sue is devastated at maud's betrayal and furious that gentleman double-crossed her. when she screams to the asylum doctors that she is not mrs rivers but her maid susan, they ignore her, as gentleman (helped by maud) has convinced them that this is precisely her delusion, and that she is really maud lilly rivers, his troubled wife. sue is treated appallingly by the nurses in the asylum, being subjected to beatings and taunts on a regular basis. such is her maltreatment and loneliness that, after a time, she begins to fear that she truly has gone mad. she is sustained by the belief that mrs sucksby will find and rescue her. sue dwells on maud's betrayal, the devastation of which quickly turns to anger. sue's chance at freedom comes when charles, a knife boy from briar, comes to visit her. he is the nephew, it turns out, of the local woman (mrs cream) who owned the cottage the trio had stayed in on the night of maud and gentleman's wedding. charles, a simple boy, had been pining for the charming attentions of gentleman to such an extent that his father mr way had begun to beat him, severely. charles ran away, and had been directed to the asylum by mrs cream, who had no idea of the nature of the place. sue quickly enlists his help in her escape, persuading him to purchase a blank key and a file to give to her on his next visit. this he does, and sue, using the skills learnt growing up in the borough, escapes from the asylum and travels with charles to london, with the intention of returning to mrs sucksby and her home in lant street. on arrival, an astonished sue sees maud at her bedroom window. after days of watching the activity of her old home from a nearby boarding house, sue sends charles with a letter explaining all to mrs sucksby, still believing that it was maud and gentleman alone who deceived her. charles returns, saying maud intercepted the letter, and sends sue a playing card—the two of hearts, representing lovers—in reply. sue takes the token as a joke, and storms into the house to confront maud, half-mad with rage. she tells everything to mrs sucksby, who pretends to have known nothing, and despite mrs sucksby's repeated attempts to calm her, swears she will kill maud for what she has done to her. gentleman arrives, and though initially shocked at sue's escape, laughingly begins to tell sue how mrs sucksby played her for a fool. maud physically tries to stop him, knowing how the truth would devastate sue; a scuffle between maud, gentleman and mrs sucksby ensues, and in the confusion, gentleman is stabbed by the knife sue had taken up to kill maud, minutes earlier. he bleeds to death. a hysterical charles alerts the police. mrs sucksby, at last sorry for how she has deceived the two girls, immediately confesses to the murder: "lord knows, i'm sorry for it now; but i done it. and these girls here are innocent girls, and know nothing at all about it; and have harmed no-one." mrs sucksby is hanged for killing gentleman; it is revealed that richard rivers was not a shamed gentleman at all, but a draper's son named frederick bunt, who had had ideas above his station. maud disappears, though sue sees her briefly at mrs sucksby's trial and gathers from the prison matrons that maud had been visiting mrs sucksby in the days leading up to her death. sue remains unaware of her true parentage, until she finds the will of marianne lilly tucked in the folds of mrs sucksby's gown. realizing everything, an overwhelmed sue sets out to find maud, beginning by returning to briar. it is there she finds maud, and the nature of christopher lilly's work is finally revealed to sue. it is further revealed that maud is now writing erotic fiction to sustain herself financially. the two girls, still very much in love with each other despite everything, make peace and give vent to their feelings at last. ||| 1 ||| 2
the queen of air and darkness is the second book in the four-part work the once and future king which chronicles white's own version of the legend of king arthur. although it is the shortest book in the series, it is a vital point in the story for several reasons: *arthur invents the idea of the round table, which was central to the plot of the third and fourth books. *arthur also defeats barons those rebelling against him, thereby securing his role as king. *arthur's understanding of "might vs. right" is explored more deeply in this book. *the orkney faction is introduced. these four children (gawain, agravaine, gaheris, and gareth) become major characters for the rest of white's work. *king pellinore gets married and has several children who will become important in the ill-made knight. the novel begins with the four orkney children, gawaine, agravaine, gaheris, and gareth, telling each other stories late at night. as they speak, it becomes clear that they have great respect and love for their mother, the beautiful queen morgause, although she does not devote herself entirely to motherhood, but has a desire to understand and unlock her magical powers whilst her husband, king lot, is off to war against king arthur. we also learn that arthur's father, uther pendragon, had raped morgause's mother, igraine, making morgause arthur's half-sister (although no one is yet aware of this fact except for merlyn, who had forgotten to tell it to arthur). arthur is still being tutored by merlyn, although the relationship between the two has changed. instead of seeing merlyn as an almighty sage, arthur treats him as more of a friend throughout the novel. despite this, merlyn still attempts to teach arthur how he can create a perfect society out of his newly-formed kingdom. arthur is unimpressed, and would rather be off fighting wars than taking care of peasants. meanwhile, back in the orkney isles, the four orkney children are bored and seek a story from their own tutor, st. toirdelbach, a very different teacher from merlyn. he tells them a story, but quickly becomes annoyed with the boys, and threatens to hit them with his shelleleigh if they refuse to leave him alone. this is one of white's best examples of how different the loveless childhoods of the orkney children were from the happy childhood of arthur. as the children are walking on the beach after visiting st. toirdelbach, sir grummor grummursum and king pellinore arrive on the shore in a magic barge. along with them is a saracen knight named sir palomides who has apparently befriended them between the previous book and their arrival on the orkney islands. the trio had previously been in flanders where pellinore fell in love with the queen of flander's daughter. the knights entered the boat and had been unable to turn it around, causing pellinore to become so lovesick, he no longer wishes to hunt the questing beast, his lifelong passion. arthur, meanwhile, is preparing for the battle against lot's gaelic warriors which lies ahead. he has begun to buy into the idea of chivalry, and of "might vs. right." he announces to merlyn that he plans to first put down lot's rebellion and then use that power to enforce justice throughout his kingdom. morgause is pleased that the three bumbling knights have landed because they have no idea that england is at war with orkney. she takes advantage of their ignorance and attempts to make them fall in love with her. she attempts an unsuccessful unicorn hunt with the knights. the boys consult st. toirdelbach and then attempt to catch a live unicorn to present to their mother. they almost succeed but agravaine kills the unicorn in a fit of rage (the boys were pretending the virgin who lured the unicorn was their mother and agravaine hated the unicorn for touching their "mother"). the other three brothers are angry, as they believe agravaine has ruined their chances of getting a reward from their mother. only gareth feels sorry for the unicorn. morgause is not pleased at all that they succeeded where she failed; on the contrary, she has them whipped. meanwhile, on the plains of bedegraine, arthur is making final preparations for his battle. arthur announces his idea of the round table, and merlyn informs arthur that another king has such a table. ironically, this king is the father of arthur's future wife, guenever (sic). sir kay, arthur's foster-brother, says that he believes that if war will help the conquered race to live a better life, they should be conquered. merlyn angrily informs him that there is a certain austrian who shared kay's views, and "plunged the world into bloody chaos." this is an allusion to adolf hitler. sir palomides and sir grummore, concerned about king pellinore's lovesickness, plan to impersonate the questing beast and lure him back to chasing it. their plan backfires when the real questing beast appears and chases them; they spend the night caught half-way up a cliff. morgause, frustrated that the knights have not fallen for her, decides that her children matter more to her. gareth rushes to the stables to tell his brothers that she loves them, and he arrives to find that gawaine and agravaine are in a heated argument. agravaine wants to send a letter to lot, informing him of the three knights and telling lot that morgause is cheating on him. gawaine is infuriated by the idea, and he considers it betrayal to their mother. the argument ends when agravaine threatens gawaine with a hidden knife, and gawaine nearly kills him. white explains that gawaine was never able to get over these kind of sudden passions he underwent, and that they would plague him for life. merlyn knows that his time with arthur is nearly up, as he will soon be locked up for a thousand years. arthur is distressed, and asks why merlyn can't avoid the imprisonment that awaits him. merlyn tells arthur a parable which explains that no-one can escape fate (the famous story of a man who learns of his death, then rides to escape death, but ends up running into death while escaping.) he also warns arthur about guinvere and lancelot, but arthur is too saddened by merlyn's departure to take the warning to heart. early the next morning, king pellinore is walking alone on the beach when he spots palomides and grummore stuck on the cliff, with the questing beast waiting for them below. he explains that the beast has fallen in love with them (as she thinks that they are her mate when they were in disguise), and refuses to slay the creature. he simply holds it down while grummore and palomides escape to morgause's castle. pellinore is reunited with piggy, the daughter of the queen of flanders. he returns to the castle to find that the questing beast is waiting outside the castle. around this same time, merlyn has begun his journey to find nimue and passes by them. he advises the pair of knights to psychoanalyse the questing beast. they do so, but it backfires and the questing beast falls in love with sir palomides instead. pellinore gives up chasing the beast then and sir palomides takes up the job. arthur has engaged lot in a fateful battle which would determine who would rule britain. arthur overcomes lot with a sneaky ambush in the night, despite lot's larger number of soldiers. contrary to the code of "chivalric" battle (or white's version, at any rate) he also attacks the enemy knights first rather than the foot soldiers. arthur seemingly finally realizes the wrong behind slaughtering the peasants for the fun of the rich knights, as merlyn had insisted in his lessons. assisted by the french noblemen, ban and bors, arthur wins the battle. the defeated lot returns home, and the three english knights are shocked to learn that orkney has been at war with england. morgause heads south to england in order to reconcile with the english, and brings with her children and the three knights. arthur holds pellinore's wedding to piggy, as he remembers pellinore fondly as being the first knight he ever met. at the same time, st. toirdelbach also has a marriage. after the ceremony, morgause seduces arthur and becomes pregnant. it is then that merlyn, far away in north humberland, remembers that he had forgotten to tell arthur that morgause was arthur's half-sister. therefore, arthur's adultery is also incest, a very grave sin. morgause becomes pregnant with mordred, who will one day come to ruin his father's kingdom. ||| 2 ||| 2
september, a.d. 80: flavia, jonathan, nubia, and lupus are celebrating nubia's birthday with their families and their friend porcius, when a teenaged boy named scopas arrives from delphi with a message from lupus’s mother, melissa. she sends her love to her son, and asks, as a favor, that he help scopas find a job with one of the chariot racing factions in rome. he has already won races in greece, despite being barely 13 years old. though scopas is awkward and strange in his manner, flavia agrees to help him, and sends him to rome with a letter asking her uncle and avid racing fan, senator cornix, to arrange an introduction. a few weeks later, scopas sends a letter to ostia, saying that he has been taken on by the green faction at the circus maximus, which is facing a crisis: their prize racing horse, sagitta, has disappeared, and the greens are offering a 100,000 sestercii reward for his safe return before the start of the next games. flavia and the others arrange a trip to rome when flavia's father has to commission some repair work on their home, and leave on another voyage. arriving in rome with aristo, they are taken to the greens’ stables to meet scopas, who works as a groom. the lead trainer, urbanus, says scopas is the best groom he has ever known, but the other grooms despise him for his strange behavior (and possibly out of jealousy). among the greens' recently acquired horses, nubia recognizes a stallion named pegasus, who was previously owned by publius pollius felix (in the sirens of surrentum). nubia confides that she has been having nightmares about being trapped in a burning tent; showing a surprising empathy with the horses, she believes that both she and pegasus have terrible memories of losing family members to fire when they were very young. as the children leave the stables to begin looking for sagitta, a one-legged beggar says he knows exactly where to find the horse. flavia is skeptical, but nubia gives him a coin, and to everyone's amazement, the horse is indeed waiting right where the beggar said he would be. the horse is healthy, though there are signs that his legs have been burned. they lead the horse back to the stables in triumph, earning the reward, free entry permits to the stables, and a complimentary ride in the team's chariots during one of their practice runs. when flavia and co. attend the first day of the races with senator cornix and his family, things begin to go wrong for the greens. inexplicably, the horses being driven by the most prestigious charioteers go berserk on the track, throwing their riders and causing terrible, often fatal, crashes. in the stables, the four friends find other examples of sabotage, including stealing the charioteers' personal votive statuettes, and replacing the pins of the chariots with wax replicas. flavia theorizes that someone has a grudge against the greens, or else is trying to fix the race to win at gambling. she suspects urbanus, who is strangely ambivalent about their success in exposing several of the sabotage tricks. but her theory seems to fail when two charioteers from the red faction are also put out of action. lupus scouts out the track during the next race, and sees a boy, disguised as one of the greens’ stable boys, hiding near the track with a bone whistle. flavia realizes that several of the greens' star horses have been abducted, and then returned, after being tortured with fire and conditioned to fear burning when they hear a high-pitched sound. urbanus is skeptical, until nubia blows a note on her flute and sagitta goes berserk inside his stall. urbanus panics, realizing that without sagitta, he does not have a team ready to run in the next day’s race. scopas steps forward, volunteering to drive a team with pegasus in sagitta's place. urbanus grudgingly agrees. flavia realizes that all of the targeted charioteers were drivers for the greens in the previous year, including the two who now race for the reds. the only one left is a man named hierax, who they are told retired after being maimed in a crash a year ago. the friends return to their seats with senator cornix, to watch the remainder of the races. but when they get up to leave, flavia realizes that nubia and lupus are gone. running back to the stables, they see that pegasus is also gone. it turns out that the one-legged beggar who helped them before has convinced nubia to lead pegasus away from the stables, rather than risk him being hurt in the races. nubia has come to love the horse, and seizes on the chance to take him to a better place. the beggar leads them to a supposedly abandoned house in rome, which has a stable outfitted to receive pegasus. but nubia realizes that the house isn't abandoned at all, it belongs to the “beggar” who reveals himself to her at the same time flavia and the others learn his true identity: he is hierax, the former charioteer. after losing his celebrity and his leg after the chariot accident, he has become bitter and vengeful; in his paranoia, he now believes that the crash and everything that came after was a conspiracy by urbanus and the greens to get rid of him. he has arranged the whole series of accidents to get his revenge on the greens. but as he steps forward to tie nubia up, pegasus rears and knocks over a lamp, setting the stable on fire. lupus has followed nubia as far as the house, and runs back to the circus to fetch reinforcements. urbanus, flavia, jonathan, and senator cornix rush to the house as it begins to burn. inside, nubia douses herself and pegasus with water and then mounts him, whispering that the only way to save their lives is for pegasus to brave his fears and jump through the flames. he does so, and they escape the house. but urbanus has already run inside to see if there are any others, and is trapped by falling debris. remembering the other victims of the great fire in rome, that he blames on himself, jonathan rushes inside and drags urbanus to safety, suffering a near-fatal asthma attack as a result of smoke inhalation. everyone recovers, and hierax and his accomplices are caught. the next day, scopas convinces nubia that, although chariot racing may be very dangerous, both he and pegasus truly love it. nubia senses through her bond with pegasus that this is true. she gives pegasus her blessing before he runs his first race. to everyone's great amazement, scopas wins the race, something unheard of for a novice charioteer in his first run. the children's friend, senator cornix's slave sisyphus, wins his freedom on a bet from senator cornix, and makes a small fortune betting his savings on scopas. scopas receives his victory crown from the emperor himself, and as he takes his triumphal ride around the track, he invites nubia to join him, calling it her victory as well as his. senator cornix's two young children, yelling scopas’s name, say “scorpus” by mistake, and the crowd takes up the chant with enthusiasm. scopus says he doesn't mind. “it can be my new name for my new life.” ||| 0 ||| 2
the rowan tells the life story of a young orphan, of prime talent, from the moment the child's community is wiped out in a mudslide to the time when she becomes a prime and after a life of loneliness falls in love with a previously undiscovered prime in a far away star system being attacked by aliens. the central section of the book is based on mccaffrey's earlier short story "lady in the tower" *talent level: t-1 telekinetic/telepath;

the content is divided into five parts. the first part, ancient balances, considers psychological and historical aspects of debt. atwood calls debt an imaginative human construct derived from a sense of need or greed and a sense of fairness in reciprocity and equivalent values. she cites a study by frans de waal that suggests a sense of fairness may be a genetic trait shared with other primates, and a study by robert axelrod which illustrates, given a level playing field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the code of hammurabi, ancient egyptians, and the greco-roman mythologies. the second part, debt and sin, explores the theological side, including moral or ethical characteristics attributed to debtors and creditors by society and religion. debt, like certain vices, such as cigarette-smoking, have experienced times when it was considered sinful, and other times fashionable. biblical references, like the book of deuteronomy, the lord's prayer, and sin-eating, are examined. the growth of debt is linked to the growth of the written media with the relationship symbolized by the faustian contract with the devil. the third part, debt as plot, examines the "debtor" game from eric berne's games people play and its derivative "try and collect". debt as a motif and theme is explained, especially in 19th century literature, with examples from "the devil and tom walker", wuthering heights, vanity fair, madame bovary, house of mirth, and the mill on the floss. atwood posits a theory that charles dickens' ebenezer scrooge is the reverse character of christopher marlowe's doctor faustus; although scrooge is rich, he is unwilling to spend his money and is living miserably before he is saved., while doctor faustus is rich, happy, and generous but ends in hell. the fourth part, the shadow side, looks at what happens to debtors and creditors when debts are not re-paid. some debts that are a matter of honour to which the debtor must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or extract revenge. debts to society, after committing crimes, are paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. the united kingdom had debtors' prison for those who could not pay, but this was abolished for economic reasons as it prevented labourers from working and had a burdensome cost of operation. other societies used the services of their family members or themselves as collateral. sometimes the debtors overthrew the creditors, like king philip iv of france against the knights templar, or the ugandans against the asians. atwood applies the trickle-down economics to debt and examines the psychology side through the jungian shadow. in the final part, titled payback, atwood examines ecological debt. she recounts the journey of scrooge in a christmas carol but placed in a modern setting. the modern-day scrooge is visited by the spirits of earth day. in the past scrooge witnesses debts to nature being repaid through animal and human sacrifices and through pestilence in over-crowded or unsustainable populations. in the present scrooge witnesses current unsustainable practices, over-fishing and deforestation, creating a debt to nature being repaid through effects on the climate and impacts on people. finally, in the future, scrooge is shown two versions: one, an eco-friendly human society balanced with environmental systems, and the other, a dystopian future with a disaster affecting the fuel or food resources in such a way that hyperinflation sets in and renders money useless. ||| 4 ||| 5
neveryóna (a full-length novel), the sixth and longest tale of the return to nevèrÿon series, focuses on fifteen-year-old pryn, who is extraordinary in this culture because she can read and write. pryn is the great niece of an unsung genius of nevèrÿon, a woman who invented both the loom and the spindle. because she did not have the good fortune also to discover that wool made the best and strongest cloth, however, all the credit for her work tends to be given to other people. pryn’s travels take her (and the reader) not only to explore the revolutionary forces of gorgik’s campaign—and some of its internal squabbles—but also through the homes of several wealthy conservatives. in the first half of the novel, pryn finds herself in neveryóna, an upper class suburb of port kolhari, an uneasy guest in the emotionally embattled gardens of a wealthy merchant woman, madame keyne, whom we first met in the third story, “the tale of potters and dragons,” and who is now actively financing a crackpot group of counter rebels who want to put an end to gorgik’s project. in the second half, once pryn travels into the south, she is taken up by the powerful jue gruten family, who represent the far more lethal and aristocratic forces of the nation who want to end this rebellion. here the webs of power are almost too complex and wide reaching for pryn to comprehend, even though she now realizes that one can fight them, a single incident at a time, as she manages to free a single slave from their grip, whom the earl has tried to use as a scapegoat. but pryn and the reader now have a far clearer picture of what gorgik is up against. between the novel’s first part and its second part, pryn spends some time with a good-hearted but sadly limited peasant family, who live in the little town of enoch and who represent the working classes that gorgik will have to enlist somehow if he is to succeed. (a city name that appears several times throughout delany’s non-nevèrÿon work, notably in the mad man [1966], "enoch" is mentioned in genesis as the first city built by man, specifically by cain’s son, adam and eve’s grandson, after whom it was named. in delany's work, “enoch” is never a big city. rather it is a very old and small city—often much older than it thinks it is—which has forgotten its own historical origins.) these are the people who have the least sense of their own history. their perfectly sensible wants conspire, nevertheless, to defeat their own best interests, and the only role they can conceive of in which pryn can stay among them is that of the town prostitute. it is the most devastating section of the novel. an added irony is that this section is written using all the characters from that central myth of romanticism, “tristan and isolde” (with pryn playing the part of isolde), employing elements from many of the versions, including the story of “tristan’s leap,” and the tales of malot, king mark, and bragenge from wagner, and even the dwarf frocsin, from jean cocteau’s film version from the forties, “the eternal return” (1943). in delany’s version, apathy and despair have replaced passion and romance. only the power of pryn’s own imagination gives her a weapon to fight free from the seductions of these simple people’s basic goodness and her own ensnarement in their fundamental hopelessness. ||| 2 ||| 2

for more than two centuries, what would have become the united states and canada has been the north american union, a territory encompassing the northern portion of the continent except alaska, retained under the rule of russia. the two georges, a gainsborough painting, commemorates the agreement between george washington and king george iii that created this part of the british empire. the painting itself has become a symbol of national unity. while being displayed in new liverpool, the painting is stolen while a crowd is distracted by the murder of "honest" dick (a.k.a. "tricky" dick), the steamer king, a nationally-known used car salesman. colonel thomas bushell of the royal american mounted police leads the search for the painting, accompanied by its former curator dr. kathleen flannery and captain samuel stanley. some days later, a ransom note is received from the sons of liberty, a terrorist organization that wants to see america independent of britain. the governor-general of the north american union, sir martin luther king, informs bushell in confidence that the painting must be recovered before king charles iii's state visit, or the government will have to pay the sons' ransom demand of fifty million pounds. the search takes bushell, flannery, and stanley across the country via airship (an advanced form of dirigible), train, and steamer. they also meet many members of the sons of liberty, including boston newspaper editor john f. kennedy. after chasing many false leads and the wrong suspects, bushell and his associates arrive at victoria and find the two georges an hour before the king arrives. they also uncover the true culprits: the holy alliance, a union of france and spain controlling almost everything from the rio grande to cape horn, and bushell's superior officer and covert fanatic sons of liberty sympathizer, lieutenant general horace bragg. bushnell then thwarts bragg's two tries to assassinate the king. bragg is sent to the gallows, while bushell and stanley are both knighted by the king for their accomplishments. ||| 5 ||| 2
twenty-thousand years in the future, cass, a humanoid physicist from earth, travels to mimosa orbital station and begins a series of experiments to test the extremities of the fictitious sarumpaet rules, a set of fundamental equations in "quantum graph theory," which holds that physical existence is a manifestation of complex constructions of mathematical graphs. however, the experiments unexpectedly create a bubble of something more stable than ordinary vacuum, dubbed novo-vacuum, that expands outward at half the speed of light as ordinary vacuum collapses to this new state at the border, hinting at more general laws beyond the sarumpaet rules. the local population is forced to flee to ever more distant star systems to escape the steadily approaching border, but since the expansion never slows, it is just a matter of time before the novo-vacuum encompasses any given region within the local group. two factions develop as the expanding bubble swallows star after star: the preservationists, who wish to stop the expansion and preserve the milky way at any cost; and the yielders, who consider the novo-vacuum to be too important a discovery to destroy without understanding. six hundred years after the initial experiment, aboard the rindler, a vessel that has matched velocities with the border and is powered by multispectral light emitted as the ordinary vacuum collapses into its lower energy-state, a variety of refugees are probing the novo-vacuum in order to understand the physics that makes it possible. the novo-vacuum turns out to be more complicated than anyone suspects, however, and egan's usual topics of simulation and quantum ontology are taken to the extreme when we learn that a whole ordered universe exists within this zone of apparent chaos, existing as direct elaborations of the quantum graph's lattice structure, of which elementary particles, fundamental interactions, and our spacetime itself are only special cases. ||| 5 ||| 5

the novel interweaves the stories of real and fictional characters. it is told from many points of view, including that of henry wirz, the camp commandant, who was later executed. it also features william collins, a union soldier and one of the leaders of the "raiders". the "raiders" are a gang of thugs, mainly bounty jumpers who steal from their fellow prisoners and lead comfortable lives while other prisoners die of starvation and disease. other characters include numerous ordinary prisoners of war, the camp physician/doctor, a nearby plantation owner, guards and confederate civilians in the area near the prison. andersonville is clearly based on prisoner memoirs, most notably andersonville: a story of rebel military prisons by john mcelroy. henry wirz, who received an injury earlier in the war and never recovered properly, is portrayed not as an inhuman fiend but as a sick man struggling with a job beyond his capacities. kantor's novel was not the basis for a 1996 john frankenheimer film andersonville. although kantor did sell the motion picture rights of his novel to one of the major hollywood studios in the 1950s, it was never produced. kantor's novel and the movie of the same name are two separate properties. ||| 0 ||| 5

captain hastings visits poirot and finds that poirot is leaving for south america. he has been offered a huge amount of money by the american 'soap king' millionaire abe ryland. poirot inquires if hastings has ever heard the phrase the big four. hastings responds uncooperatively. at the eleventh hour an unexpected visitor called mayerling comes in saying only "m. hercule poirot, 14 farraway street." when he is given a piece of paper by a doctor he writes the number 4 many times. when hastings mentions the big four, the man begins speaking, he tells them that number 1 is a chinese political mastermind named li chang yen. he represents the brains of the big four. number 2 is usually not named but represented by a '$' or two stripes and a star so he is probably american and he represents wealth. number 3 is a frenchwoman and number 4 is the destroyer. after an aborted start on poirot's trip to south america, they return to the flat to find the man dead. the doctor is summoned and says that the man died of asphyxiation and has been dead about two hours, he cannot be closer because the windows were open. a man from an asylum visits them and tells them that the man had escaped from his asylum. japp soon enters and recognizes the man to be mayerling, a prominent figure in the secret service. poirot asks hastings if he opened the windows to which hastings replies in the negative. poirot examines the man and announces that mayerling was gagged and poisoned using cyanide. the hands of the lounge clock were turned to 4 o'clock and poirot realizes that the murderer was the man from the asylum. poirot and hastings pay a visit to john ingles, a wealthy man, and ask him about li chang yen and the big four. he has heard of both, the former he heard of recently in a note from a fisherman who asked him for a few hundred pounds to hide himself from the big four. he had also heard of stories of four men who opposed li chang yen, who had been murdered from stabbing, poisoning, electrocution and cholera. he had also heard a similar story of a chemist who was burned to death in his residence. the note came from hoppaton so poirot, hastings and ingles go to hoppaton and find out that the man who wrote the note, a mr. jonathan whalley has been murdered. there are two suspects his maid, betsy, and his manservant grant. whalley had been hit on the head and then his throat had been cut and some jade figures he had had been stolen. grant is the main suspect as his footprints covered in blood are found around the room, the jade figures were in his room and there is a smear of blood on his room's doorknob. another reason is the fact that grant has been imprisoned before, grant got this job by a prisoner help society. poirot finds a frozen leg of mutton which interests him very much. poirot hypothesizes that the murderer was a young man who came in a trap and killed whalley and went away. his clothing was slightly bloodstained. poirot talks to grant and asks him whether he entered the room twice to take the jade figures. when negatived poirot reveals that no one noticed the murderer because he came in a butcher's cart. mutton is not delivered on sundays and if it had been delivered on saturday it would not have been frozen. the man who gave grant this job, poirot assumes, was number 4. poirot then introduces hastings to captain kent who tells them of the sinking of many u.s. boats after the japanese earthquake. after this they rounded many crooks up all of them referred to an organization called the big four. they have made a form of wireless energy capable of focusing a beam of great intensity on any spot. a british scientist called halliday experimented on this and was said to be on the eve of success when he was kidnapped while on a visit to france. poirot talks to halliday's wife who tells him that her husband went to paris on thursday the 20 july to talk to some people connected with his work among them the notable french scientist madame olivier. after lunch halliday had gone to madame olivier. he had left her at six o' clock, dined alone at some restaurant and gone to his hotel. he had walked out next morning and had not been seen afterwards. as a result poirot goes to paris with hastings. poirot and hastings visit madame olivier, question her but while leaving they catch a glimpse of a veiled lady who poirot is interested in. as soon as they exit the villa a tree falls down barely missing them. poirot then explains to hastings how halliday was kidnapped he was walking away when a lady caught up with him and told him madame olivier wanted to talk to him again. she led him and turned into a narrow alley and then into a garden told him that madame olivier's villa was on the right side then and there halliday was kidnapped. poirot goes to the villa and asks to speak to the woman who just came. she comes down, after initially refusing, when poirot sends his card. it turns out she is the countess vera rossakoff. when confronted with the theory she phones the kidnappers to send halliday back to the hotel. when halliday returns he is too scared to speak. then a man in a cloak, who is a participant in the big four, comes and tries persuading hercule poirot to stop and hastings gets into a small fight with the stranger who evades poirot, hastings, and the hotel manager with a clever disguise. poirot is told by madame olivier that two men broke into her laboratory and attempted to steal her supply of radium. poirot and hastings board a train, and in the confusion of a signal failure caused by poirot's friend, they return to mme. olivier's villa to find the thieves. however, they are ambushed by thugs, and olivier reveals herself to be number 3, and that the two shall die by her hands to prevent their interference. however, poirot tells her that the cigarette he has contains a poisonous dart, and olivier unties hastings, who unties poirot and binds and gags olivier. shortly afterwards the two receive a letter from abe ryland who was annoyed at poirot for refusing his offer. then poirot tells hastings that abe ryland is number 2, an american millionaire. ryland soon releases news that he is looking for an efficient secretary, and hastings applies and gets the job, imposing as a man called captain neville. he becomes suspicious of the manservant deaves, and he learns that ryland received an encoded letter telling him to go to a quarry at eleven o'clock. hastings spies on ryland, but is captured by ryland and deaves, who wait for poirot. when he arrives he ambushes ryland and deaves with the help of ten scotland yard officials. ryland is released after his manservant informs the police that all of it was just a wager, and poirot realises that the manservant was number four. a month later, they leave london due to the death of a mr paynter in worcestershire. he had six chinese servants, as well as his bodyguard ah ling, who poirot is interested in. paynter was living with his nephew when he felt ill after a meal and a doctor quentin was called. he told the nephew, gerald, that he had given paynter a hypodermic injection and proceeded by asking strange questions about the servants. paynter was found the next morning in a room locked from the inside, dead. it seemed that he had fallen off his chair and into the gas fire, and the doctor was blamed for leaving him in such a position. before his death, paynter had dipped his finger in ink and written "yellow jasmine" on his newspaper, a plant growing all over the house, as well as drawing two lines at right angles under the words, a sign similar to the beginning of the number 4. at the inquest, quentin was accused in a number of ways, such as that he was not the regular doctor and his recalling of the events. according to him, paynter told him as soon as the door was shut that he was not feeling ill at all and that the taste of his curry was strange. it was claimed that quentin injected him with strychnine rather than a narcotic. later, after the curry was analysed, the results showed that it contained a deadly amount of opium, implicating the servant ah ling as he was the one to cook it. also, inspector japp tells the two that the key was found near the broken door and that the window was unlatched. japp believes that the charred face was to cover up the identity of the dead man, but poirot believes the man to be paynter. poirot reveals that doctor quentin was number 4, who entered the house and gave paynter an injection of yellow jasmine rather than strychnine. he locked the door and exited through the window, returning later to put opium in the curry sample, throw paynter into the fire and steal a manuscript-the reason for the murder. a month after the case, japp informs poirot of another mysterious death- the chess grandmasters gilmour wilson and doctor savaronoff were playing chess when shortly into the game gilmour wilson collapsed dead due to heart failure. japp suspects he was poisoned, and poirot is called in. japp suspects that the poison was intended for savaronoff, a former revolutionist in russia who just escaped from the bolsheviks. he refused several times to play a game of chess with wilson but eventually gave in. the match took place in savaronoff's flat, with at least a dozen people watching the game. wilson's body had a small burn mark on his left hand and was also clutching a white bishop when he died, part of savaronoff's set. as poirot and hastings enter the doctor's flat, poirot notices that the antique persian rug has had a nail driven through it. after the proceedings in the flat, poirot and hastings return home and poirot takes out a second white bishop. he weighed the one he took with the one wilson was holding and discovered that the one he was holding was heavier. he explains that the bishop has a metal rod inside it, so that the current passing through the recently refurbished flat below is powered through the nail, into the also tampered table and into the bishop. the bishop was chosen because of wilson's predictable first few moves, and poirot suspects the servant of the flat and savaronoff's niece of working for the big four. however, when they arrive at the flat savaronoff's niece is gagged and unconscious and ivan and the doctor are nowhere to be seen. poirot explains that savaronoff did die in russia and that number four impersonated him as a cover. he killed wilson because if savaronoff was the second greatest chess master in the world, people would soon realise that number four was nothing like the chess player savaronoff was. with number four gone, the two are back to square one again. soon afterwards, hastings is given a message that his wife has been kidnapped in argentina by the big four, as well as another note saying that if he wants to see his wife again he must follow a chinese servant. he leaves four books on the table as a message for poirot, and follows him to an abandoned house in chinatown and he is taken to an arabian- like room. one of the chinese servants tries to make him write a letter in order to get poirot and threaten him with death. he is eventually forced to write it to poirot and he is soon seen across the street. as hastings is forced to beckon him into the house, a man from scotland yard throws a drugged smoke bomb into the house, knocking everyone unconscious and hastings is saved. hastings is not only greeted by poirot, but by the fact that his wife has been safe for over three months in a place poirot set up. later, poirot's agents return from their work of identifying number 4 and produce four names, with a mr claud darrell looking suspicious as he has visited both china and america. very soon, darrell's friend, florence monro, calls poirot to tell him information about darrell. she gives one important point, that when he eats he always picks up a pice of bread and dabs up the crumbs with it. she also promises to send him a photo of darrell. twenty minutes later miss monro is hit by a car and killed, while number four had taken her latch-key, gone into her flat and stolen the photograph. poirot, hastings and ingles meet with the home secretary and his client. ingles leaves for china, and poirot reveals an odd fact- he has a twin brother. the two arrive home to a nurse who says that her employer, mr templeton, often has gastric attacks after eating. when a sample of soup is tested and found to contain antimony, they set off again. the arrival of templeton's adopted son causes a disturbance; he tells poirot that he thinks his mother is trying to poison his father. poirot pretends to have stomach cramps, and when he is alone with hastings, he quickly tells him that templeton's son is number four, as he dabbed up the crumbs with a small slice of bread at the table. the two climb down the ivy and arrive at their flat. the two are caught by a trap; a matchbox filled with a chemical explodes knocking hastings unconscious and killing poirot. another shock greets hastings shortly after the funeral; john ingles had fallen overboard on his boat to china, but hastings knew this to be murder, of none other than claud darrell, number four himself. after being warned twice by a disguised number four and countess rosakoff to leave for south america, hastings is called to a hospital because ingles' chinese servant was stabbed and had a message in his pocket for hastings. the servant managed to say 'handel's largo', 'carrozza' and a few other italian words before dying. he also receives a letter from poirot to be given after his death saying to leave for south america, as it was part of the plan. the big four would think he was leaving and he could 'wreak havoc in their midst'. this is confirmed when a gentleman in a fur coat (number four) sends him a letter saying 'you are wise'. hastings is put on board a ship for belgium, where he is reunited with his supposedly dead friend, poirot. hastings is shocked, and poirot states it was to make his death look certain to the big four. the two set off for italy to lago di carrezza, which hastings thought was 'largo' and 'carrozza'. the two find a café where they go to drink coffee. however, upon their arrival, they see a man jump up from his table, and fiddle with his bread- undoubtedly number four. this was all poirot's plan- to scare a man as soon as he thinks he is safe. but it was an act; the lights went out and poirot and hastings are knocked unconscious and dragged away. they are taken to the headquarters of the big four- the felsenlabyrinth. they are confronted by ryland, olivier and number four, with chang yen being in china, and later vera rossakoff. it soon becomes clear that the man is not hercule poirot, but in fact his twin, achille. the man has a deeper voice, has no moustache and has a scar on his lip. he makes the four people aware of the fact that the mountain has been cordoned off, and that the police were about to raid the headquarters. knowing their defeat, the three members retreat to a laboratory and vera decided to bargain with poirot. he claimed that he could bring the dead back to life, and she said that she would save them if he returned her dead child. the three run out of the mountain just as it explodes, and hastings awakes to yet another surprise. achille poirot didn't exist- it was hercule poirot in disguise all along. he manages to give the countess her child back, who was really left in an orphanage, and the newspapers reveal that li chang yen, the famous chinese politician, has committed suicide. the story ends on poirot lamenting that all his other cases will seem boring and tame to this case. ||| 6 ||| 6
paul macy, freshly released from therapy, is walking the streets of new york city when he encounters a woman who addresses him as nat, the serial rapist whose body paul now inhabits. the woman, lisa, realizes her mistake, but the encounter has a strange effect on paul, and he finds himself hallucinating memories from nat hamlin's life. at first, paul does his best to ignore his past, and begin anew as a holovision newscaster. but slowly, his condition worsens. more visions strike him when he comes into contact with lisa and sculptures made by hamlin, who was a celebrated artist before committing the series of rapes that led to erasure of his personality. paul attempts to discuss his problem with dr. gomez at the rehab center. however, gomez (using eeg scans) is convinced that paul's problem is not real, and is instead just a cry for attention. while at work, lisa sends paul messages, urging him to rekindle their relationship. against his better judgment, paul agrees to have dinner with lisa at a people's restaurant. while they eat, nat hamlin is found hiding within paul's mind, and later becomes a lucid voice demanding control of his old body and memories. the two begin fighting for control of the body, and lisa's affection. when his condition worsens, paul tries to visit the rehab center again, only to find that hamlin can now cause him physical pain by stopping his heart. under the threat of pain and possible death, paul must now work alone with lisa to eradicate hamlin. lisa also has problems of her own. she is destitute and psychologically scarred by her love affair with hamlin before he was caught and convicted. she has limited esp, and can read paul's mind to some degree. seeing that there really are two personalities within paul, she feels pity and decides to help get rid of hamlin permanently. having become lovers, lisa and paul visit a museum to see the antigone 21, a lifelike psychosculpture of lisa. while looking in awe at the sculpture, paul allows nat hamlin to surface. the two argue (within paul's head) about which personality has more right to exist. nat declares that paul is a fictitious construct, and does not deserve to live having been made up by the doctors at the rehab center. paul counters by using the logic of the court, which found nat guilty and deserving of his punishment. the two can not agree. hamlin quietly goes away, while paul gains newfound confidence to control and hopefully destroy hamlin. over the next few days, paul and nat spar mentally. however, paul discovers a growing desire to know more about his past. specifically, he wants the memories of the body he now inhabits. this desire becomes a bargaining chip for nat, who offers to share his memories if paul will allow him to control the body from time to time. a bargain is agreed upon, but lisa comes home and uses esp to force nat into hiding. dr. gomez shows up at work and attempts to help paul, but there is no easy way to do that since paul fears being killed if he visits the rehab center. gomez agrees to have paul watched, because he is potentially a threat to society, and the first proof that rehab deconstruction is not 100% effective. until a solution can be found, gomez warns paul to stay away from lisa. both he and paul agree that her esp is responsible for nat's return. gomez also agrees to help lisa, after paul urges him to cure her as well. ignoring gomez, paul continues his relation with lisa, only to find her missing one day. while searching lisa's old apartment building, paul gets mugged. after the altercation, he wakes up and realizes that nat has taken over. once nat is in control, he (nat) immediately returns to his old art dealer, mr. gargan, and agrees to have nat's work sold under paul's name. their old contract is legally not binding since nat was destroyed by rehab. meanwhile, paul capitalizes on his access to hamlin's memories by harassing hamlin in turn, dredging up the details of the numerous rapes he committed and ridiculing the idea that hamlin's artistic talent redeems his past brutality. with nat still in control, they visit nat's old home. though the mansion has new owners, nat is allowed to see his old art studio only to find that he has lost his artistic talent. angry, nat leaves after getting his x-wife's home address. they (nat and paul) drive to see hamlin's ex-wife. though she is afraid of him, she allows hamlin into her home. hamlin's stream of nostalgic reminiscences quickly turns sexual and predatory, culminating in an attempted rape that allows paul to regain control of his body. paul apologizes and returns to his apartment in new york, only to find that lisa is gone. paul finds lisa in a community hostel just above the people's restaurant where they first shared a meal. lisa lays naked in bed, somewhat catatonic. while trying to convince lisa to return home with him, paul merges his identity with nat. they fight for control of the body (inside paul's head). nat is finally vanquished when lisa appears, and uses her esp abilities to strike nat down with mental lightning. ||| 2 ||| 5

the apparent cause of this distribution of humans is the mysterious and immensely powerful posthuman entity which calls itself "the eschaton". although the eschaton is usually benign and uninvolved in human affairs, it strictly enforces certain rules on human civilization out of apparent self-interest. to this end, the eschaton has helpfully left a message throughout human space, for example, engraved in huge letters on the sides of mountains, and dispersed everywhere throughout computer networks. the message is as follows: :i am the eschaton. i am not your god. :i am descended from you, and exist in your future. :thou shalt not violate causality within my historic light cone. or else. the most important commandment of the eschaton appears to be "thou shalt not violate causality"; that is, the eschaton strictly prohibits the use of faster than light travel for reaching any point in its own relative past, with the ominous proscription "or else". the eschaton apparently makes use of time travel itself, but whenever a civilization attempts to break this rule, it is forcibly prevented from doing so immediately before the act (often with immense overkill, such as in at least one case where the relevant civilization's star is induced into going supernova). inscrutable, and uncommunicative beyond disseminating the knowledge of its laws, the eschaton generally does not provide further warnings before it acts. the eschaton's other major involvement is that at a particular point in the book's history, it scattered pieces of human civilization, against their will, throughout nearby (within a few thousand light years) space, but it did so using instantaneous travel, and in some cases actually moved them backwards in time. this means that some civilizations, such as the festival mentioned below, have been progressing for hundreds of years on their own before they encounter the rest of human civilization. although human civilization on earth collapsed in the wake of singularity, by the time of the events in singularity sky, earth has recovered and become one of the more powerful and influential human societies. the earth non-government, known as the united nations and descended from the modern-day internet engineering task force, uses its agents to prevent other civilizations from breaking the eschaton's rules so as to avoid the eschaton taking enforcement action which may affect the very existence of earth and the wider galaxy-spanning human race. unknown to human civilization at large, the eschaton also has its own human agents working to this end. the novel features the exploits of one such agent, martin springfield, an engineer specializing in faster-than-light starship engines who is hired by the new republic (a totalitarian and relatively backward neo-luddite civilization) to upgrade the faster-than-light engines of their fleet of warships. the un also suspects that the new republic may attempt to use the upgraded engines to violate causality, so it dispatches one of its agents, rachel mansour, to the new republic. this attempt comes to pass sooner than expected, when the new republic colony on rochard's world encounters the festival, a spacefaring transhuman civilization/entity which trades highly advanced technology if prospective recipients can respond to the request: "entertain us". the old world order on rochard's world quickly breaks down under this onslaught. interpreting the failure of communications with the colony as the result of enemy action, the new republic dispatches a mighty war fleet to rochard's world, with martin springfield and rachel mansour aboard the flagship. a recurring theme of this book is that information and by extension progress are inexorable: the conflict between the neo-luddite/monarchist new republic and the post-singularity transhuman culture that contacts them is utterly devastating for the status quo of the former, and our spy heroes are world-weary enough to realize this, exasperated by their apparent inability to understand that one can no more avoid change than one can avoid breathing. information is, by whatever mechanism, the phlogiston of said change, providing its vital energies. ||| 5 ||| 5
breaking dawn is divided into three separate parts. the first part details bella's marriage and honeymoon with edward, which they spend on a private island owned by carlisle who bought it for esme, called isle esme, off the coast of brazil. two weeks into their honeymoon, bella realizes that she is pregnant with a half-vampire, half-human child and that her condition is progressing at an unnaturally accelerated rate. after contacting carlisle, who confirms her pregnancy, she and edward immediately return home to forks, washington. the fetus continues to develop with unnatural rapidity, and edward, concerned for bella's life and convinced that the fetus is going to kill her, urges her to abort the pregnancy. however, bella feels a connection with her unborn baby and refuses. the novel's second part is written from the perspective of shape-shifter jacob black, and lasts throughout bella's pregnancy and childbirth. jacob's quileute wolf pack, not knowing what danger the unborn child may pose, plan to destroy it and kill bella. jacob vehemently protests this decision and leaves, forming his own pack with seth and leah clearwater. the fetus in bella's body grows swiftly and bella soon gives birth. the baby breaks many of her bones, including her spine, and she loses massive amounts of blood. in order to save her life, edward changes her into a vampire by injecting his venom into her heart. jacob, thinking that bella is dead, and blaming bella's daughter renesmee as the cause, tries to kill renesmee. instead, he "imprints"—an involuntary response in which a shape-shifter finds his soul mate—on her. the third section shifts back to bella's perspective, describing bella's painful transformation and finding herself changed into a vampire and enjoying her new life and abilities. however, the vampire irina misidentifies renesmee as an "immortal child", a child who has been turned into a vampire. because "immortal children" are uncontrollable, creating them has been outlawed by the volturi. after irina presents her allegation to the volturi, they plan to destroy renesmee and the cullens. in an attempt to survive, the cullens gather other vampire clans from around the world to stand as witnesses and prove to the volturi that renesmee is not an immortal child. upon confronting the gathered cullen allies and witnesses, the volturi discover that they have been misinformed and immediately execute irina for her mistake. however, they remain undecided on whether renesmee should be viewed as a threat to vampires' secret existence. at that time, alice and jasper, who had left prior to the confrontation, return with a mapuche called nahuel, a 150-year-old vampire-human crossbreed like renesmee. nahuel demonstrates that the crossbreeds pose no threat, and the volturi leave. edward, bella, and renesmee return to their home in peace. ||| 7 ||| 2
in rocheworld, a small group of civilian and military personnel crew humanity's first manned exploration of another star system. using a laser-pumped light sail spacecraft, the journey to their destination of barnard's star lasted 40 years. the crew used a drug called "no-die" which slowed their aging process, whilst proportionately lowering their effective i.q., and arrived only a decade physically older than when they left. a fraction of the crew visit the double planet rocheworld, landing on the water-free lobe, dubbed roche (french for rock as well as the name of the french mathematician who worked on roche limits). after exploring roche, they again split up, and one group journeys via the space-plane dragonfly to the other lobe, eau (french for water), which is covered almost entirely by ocean. the crew are caught in a violent storm that causes their plane to experience a crash water-landing. the flooded propulsion systems of the space-plane are unable to provide enough thrust to break free and take off from the ocean surface. the crew decide to use the plane's lift fans as propellers to make their way to the inner pole of the double planet, where the gravitation from the other lobe of the double planet should help them to break free and allow rendezvous with the remaining crew in the lander at the zero point between the two lobes. while making this journey, the space-plane attracts the attention of one of the native species of the planet: the very intelligent, but technologically lacking, flouwen. the flouwen and the artificial intelligence aboard the space-plane establish communications and the two species begin to exchange cultural and scientific knowledge. the flouwen realize the humans are travelling to the pole and warn the humans that they are approaching a period where the configuration of the star and planets of the system allow for a phenomenon where the ocean on the water lobe of rocheworld can partially flow to the rocky lobe, due to the change in the gravitational equipotential. they try to stop the humans from continuing into this violent event by pinning the spacecraft to the ammonia-water ocean floor with ice as ballast (water ice sinks in the less dense ammonia-water solution of the ocean). however, the humans realize that the interplanetary waterfall poses a threat to the crew remaining on roche. fortunately, the tidal stresses cause nearby dormant volcanoes to become active again. this melts an underwater glacier and floods the area with warm water, upon which the ice floats off the plane. the crew manages to get airborne and takes advantage of the changing equipotential to return to roche. they rendezvous with the lander just as water is reaching it. ||| 5 ||| 5

tim purdom is born in 1937 in a small village on the kentish coast as the illegitimate son of a young woman who dies in her early forties. after her death in 1959, purdom decides to move to london as he does not have any sense of belonging to his home town any more. he finds cheap accommodation in bayswater and work in a snack bar in soho. purdom is not only a jazz fanatic (his favourite musician is thelonious monk) but also an intellectual who reads books and who is interested in what is going on in the world, both politically and culturally. his intellectual pursuits do not go together with his lifestyle or his job. however, without any formal education or money, he is reduced to the kind of life he is leading; but, unambitious by nature, he is quite content with it for the time being. very early during his stay in london purdom is confronted with petty crime through his contact with guests and workmates. when he is offered some extra money by one of the older regulars he tags along with him and suddenly finds himself in a place where "dirty pictures"&mdash;which were illegal at the time&mdash;are taken. he is then approached by the owner of some adult bookshops and encouraged to become a pornographic photographer himself. the customers like his pictures, which are sold under the counter, and purdom makes some good money. he is initiated into the world of private parties where old blue movies of foreign origin are shown to middle-aged upper middle class men in the company of young, attractively made up women. at one of those parties, where he works as the projectionist, he meets a man who later turns out to be stephen ward, one of the key figures in what will later be referred to as the profumo affair. ward supplies purdom with a good many "models" for his photographic sessions. eventually purdom buys an 8 mm amateur movie camera and starts shooting pornographic movie shorts himself. his short-lived career is already over in early 1963 when he is told by his employer that the industry has moved on and that cheap scandinavian imports are now in demand, which are also in colour rather than black and white. purdom keeps on working at the snack bar and in addition is commissioned to do some serious photography about london for foreign magazines. he has become a respectable citizen with a new girlfriend who does not know anything about the shady business he has left behind. it is then that he feels he is being haunted by his past. ||| 3 ||| 6
the coopers, a family of christian archaeologists, are recruited by president al-dallam, a greedy oil sheik, to journey to the bottom of the dragon's throat, where many other expeditions have met with gruesome deaths, never having unravelled the mystery of what lurks at the bottom. however, the cooper family have an edge: their unwavering faith in god, which holds up to scrutiny and testing throughout the book. upon arrival, they are greeted by gozan, al-dallam's aide, another fearful and greedy man, who shows them to the dragon's throat. after a stakeout and a few scares, they realise that this 'dragon's throat' is more dangerous than they initially expected, but they journey down anyway. they are met by an earthquake, paranormal activity, and the door, massive and ornate. while the coopers continue trying to open the door, their activities are watched and thwarted from time to time by a chaldean sorcerer. as well as the shaman's efforts, jay's beliefs are challenged by gozan, who wants the 'treasure behind the door' for himself. jay stands firm and makes himself an absolute model of christianity for peretti's young readers. as the coopers realise the door may not be breached by brute force, they hear a rumour of a key, the only thing that can open the colossal doors. as they search the winding eastern city for the 'street of the scorpion,' the key's location, jay and lila are separated and kidnapped by the desert shaman. the sorcerer is converted to christianity, breaking all the curses upon him, and he becomes an ally. as keeper of the door, he shows jay and lila the key, but tells them that it is not treasure behind the door, but a powerful demonic force awaiting its release upon the world. during this conversation, gozan steals the key and rushes it to his president. a desperate chase begins to get to the door before the president. he beats them to it but a last minute action by jay saves the earth. ||| 7 ||| 5

the novel begins with the death of a nun, sister miriam, who apparently starved herself to death in a ruined tower, known as the 'tower of ivory', which adjoins the grounds of the convent of the blessed eleanor, a nunnery and an all-girls school. the tower has specific significance to the order, as it was the original convent building. the tower and the ancient history of the order are recorded in the treasury of the blessed eleanor, a manuscript which is referenced throughout the story. though it is never stated explicitly, blessed eleanor is presumed to be eleanor of aquitaine, the once queen of england. television reporter jemima shore is an old school friend of sister miriam, who was also known as rosabelle powerstock and was heiress to "the powers fortune", one of the largest fortunes in britain. jemima is invited back to the convent by reverend mother ancilla, where she uncovers a number of mysteries, including the suggestion that miriam, whose family owned the convent lands, may have written a second will bequeathing them away from the order, and into the hands of another charity. the tension builds when the girls at the convent school tell jemima that the black nun - a malevolent faceless spectre reputed to appear whenever a death is about to take place within the grounds - was seen just prior to sister miriam's death, and has been sighted again. ||| 1 ||| 6
1633 continues where 1632 left off. most of the novel details various political machinations of the new "united states" and the attempts of cardinal richelieu to nullify the threat posed by the technological advantage the up-timers have given to gustavus adolphus and his "confederated principalities of europe". richelieu completely changes france's foreign policy and forms an alliance aimed squarely at the nus and gustavus called the league of ostend. mike stearns sends emissaries looking for allies, some of whom end up behind enemy lines as they already belong to the secret league of ostend, which announces its presence in the battle of four fleets. the dutch republic nearly falls and stearns' emissary voluntarily stays behind, becoming trapped in the siege of amsterdam. at this point, the newly created timeline start to diverge greatly from the actual history of the 17th century, in no small part because the news of a town from the future brought spies and emissaries, and a fair number of encyclopedias and history textbooks found their way into european courts. one theme of the series is of down-timer leaders trying to change, hasten or head off their histories while the acts of ordinary citizens going about their day to day affairs and of the leaders of grantville effect more fundamental societal and political changes. ||| 5 ||| 5

in the introductory chapter, "three lost travelers", the kits mosskit, adderkit and blossomkit have somehow walked from starclan to rock's home under the earth. rock tells the three that they did not live long enough to learn about their clanmates. he says he will answer their questions "about the cats you left behind." rock describes himself as "the keeper of the world beneath the one your former clanmates walk." the remainder of the book consists of rock's stories about each clan, and various cats (or a group of cats) within the clan. rock describes major events in the cat's life, and often comments on why the cat is special or acted as he/she did. there are also stories about a few cats from the tribe of rushing water, skyclan, and bloodclan in addition to some loners and kittypets. although rock, as the narrator, claims neutrality, the book does not treat each clan equally, devoting more space to thunderclan cats and being highly critical of one of the other clans. this is to be expected since readers get to know more of the thunderclan cats from series than those from the other clans. ||| 2 ||| 4

padishah emperor shaddam iv of house corrino has come to fear house atreides due to the growing popularity of duke leto atreides within the landsraad, the convocation of ruling houses. shaddam decides that house atreides must be destroyed, but cannot risk an overt attack on a single house, as this would not be accepted by the landsraad and could be met with civil war. the emperor instead uses the centuries-old feud between house atreides and house harkonnen to disguise his assault, enlisting the brilliant and power-hungry baron vladimir harkonnen in his plan to trap and eliminate the atreides. to remove them from their fief of caladan, where they are protected by their elite navy, shaddam entices leto to accept the lucrative fief of the "spice planet", arrakis, previously controlled by the harkonnens. leto's control of the only planet capable of spice production would increase the power of house atreides, which has not, historically, been influential or wealthy. complicating the political intrigue is the fact that the duke's son paul atreides is an essential part of the bene gesserit's secret, centuries-old breeding program. leto's concubine, the bene gesserit lady jessica, was ordered to give birth to a daughter. capable of determining her child's sex due to her bene gesserit abilities, she instead bears a boy, to provide an heir for leto. leto correctly believes his rivals and enemies to be plotting against him, and the atreides are able to thwart initial harkonnen traps and complications while simultaneously building trust with the mysterious desert fremen, with whom they hope to ally. however, the atreides are ultimately unable to withstand a devastating harkonnen attack, supported by house corrino's elite corps of sardaukar, disguised as harkonnen troops. the attack is assisted by a traitor within house atreides suk doctor wellington yueh, who is not suspected of disloyalty due to conditioning he underwent to complete his medical training. house atreides' forces are unable to counterattack effectively and the house is scattered, with leto taken captive by yueh and delivered to the harkonnens. of the houses' principal retainers, mentat thufir hawat is captured by the sardaukar; the troubador-soldier gurney halleck escapes with the aid of smugglers, whom he joins; and military commander duncan idaho is killed defending paul and jessica. yueh, who has only betrayed the atreides to further a personal feud with baron harkonnen, plants a poison tooth in leto's mouth, which he hopes will kill the baron when bitten. yueh is executed by the baron, who distrusts him, but leto manages to kill the baron's chief retainer, mentat piter de vries, when he is brought before harkonnen. the baron evades the poison cloud expelled from the tooth, surviving the attack and enlisting atreides mentat thufir hawat into his service. jessica's bene gesserit abilities and paul's developing skills, which have been taught to him by his mother, help them join a band of fremen. paul and his mother quickly learn fremen ways while teaching the fremen the weirding way, a bene gesserit method of fighting. jessica becomes a reverend mother, ingesting the poisonous water of life while pregnant with her second child; this unborn daughter alia is subjected to the same ordeal, acquiring the full abilities of a reverend mother before even being born. paul takes a fremen lover, chani, with whom he fathers a son. years pass, and paul increasingly recognizes the strength of the fremen fighting force and their potential to overtake even the "unstoppable" sardaukar and win back arrakis. the spice diet of the fremen and his own developing mental powers cause paul's prescience to be increase dramatically, allowing his forsight of future "paths" of possible events, and he is regarded by the fremen as their prophesied messiah. as paul grows in influence, he begins a jihad against harkonnen rule of the planet under his new fremen name, muad'dib. however, paul becomes aware through his prescience that, if he is not careful, the fremen will extend that jihad against all the known universe, which paul describes as a humanity-spanning subconscious effort to avoid genetic stagnation. both the emperor and the baron harkonnen show increasing concern at the fervor of religious fanaticism shown on arrakis for this "muad'dib", not guessing that this leader is the presumed-dead paul. harkonnen plots to send his nephew and heir feyd rautha as a replacement for his more brutish nephew glossu rabban — who is in charge of the planet — with the hope of gaining the respect of the population. however, the emperor is highly suspicious of the baron and sends spies to watch his movements. hawat explains the emperor's suspicions: the sardaukar, nearly invincible in battle, are trained on the prison planet salusa secundus, whose inhospitable conditions allow only the best to survive. arrakis serves as a similar crucible, and the emperor fears that the baron could recruit from it a fighting force to rival his sardaukar, just as house atreides had intended before its destruction. paul is reunited with gurney. completely loyal to the atreides, gurney is convinced that jessica is the traitor who caused the house's downfall, and nearly kills her before being stopped by paul. disturbed that his prescience had not predicted this possibility, paul decides to take the water of life, an act which will either confirm his status as the kwisatz haderach or kill him. after three weeks in a near-death state, paul emerges with his powers refined and focused; he is able to see past, present, and future at will. looking into space, he sees that the emperor and the harkonnens have amassed a huge armada to invade the planet and regain control. paul also realizes the way to control spice production on arrakis: saturating spice fields with the water of life would cause a chain reaction that would destroy all spice on the planet. in an imperial attack on a fremen settlement, paul and chani's son leto is killed, and the four-year-old alia is captured by sardaukar and brought to the planet's capital arrakeen, where the baron harkonnen is attempting to thwart the fremen jihad under the close watch of the emperor. the emperor is surprised at alia's defiance of his power and her confidence in her brother, whom she reveals to be paul atreides. at that moment, under cover of a gigantic sandstorm, paul and his army of fremen attack the city riding sandworms; alia kills the baron during the confusion. paul quickly overtakes the city's defenses and confronts the emperor, threatening to destroy the spice, thereby ending space travel and crippling both imperial power and the bene gesserit in one blow. feyd-rautha challenges paul to a knife-duel in a final attempt to stop his overthrow, but is defeated despite an attempt at treachery. realizing that paul is capable of doing all he has threatened, the emperor is forced to abdicate and to promise his daughter princess irulan in marriage to paul. chani is not happy with this decision, and paul describes that chani will always be the one he loves. paul ascends the throne, his control of arrakis and the spice establishing a new kind of power over the empire that will change the face of the known universe. however, despite being emperor of the known universe, paul realizes that he will not be able to stop the jihad he has seen in his visions, his legendary status among the fremen having grown past the point where he can control it. ||| 5 ||| 2

and tell her what they had learned from megan. elsa is at the apartment, tormenting helen about the attack on barry and reluctantly leaves after julie and ray arrive. julie suggests it may be elsa responsible for the threats and the shooting, as she has always resented helen, and may have learned about it by accident, as helen used to share a room with her. ray calls the cox family at the hospital. he finds out that since barry was shot in the spine, he has paralysis and it may be permanent. ray then goes to the hospital and sneaks in to see barry. while there, ray tries to talk barry into dissolving the pact of keeping the accident a secret. after barry says no and lies that the shooting was a robbery and nothing to do with the accident, ray leaves the hospital. barry, however, thinks back to the night of the shooting, where he was lured out by an anonymous caller that supposedly had photographic evidence of the accident and would give the photos to barry in exchange for money. barry fell for it, agreed to meet the anonymous person at the university athletic field, and was shot. on the way out of the hospital, ray sees bud and they decide to go have coffee together. while they talk over coffee, ray says that he will get julie back. bud challenges him then says julie will not go to smith because of him. later, helen unexpectedly meets collie in her apartment, who solemnly reveals himself to be david's older brother. he, darkly remembering, tells helen that he was the one that shot barry and is the one that left the picture on her door. he then tells her that he is going to kill her and the girl he is going out with later tonight. panicking, she immediately runs to the bathroom and locks the door. when collie begins to take the door off the hinges so that he can get in, helen breaks the glass of the bathroom window and desperately escapes. julie prepares to go on a date with bud, but then decides not to when her mother says she is worried and would like her to stay home. when she tells bud, he convinces her to at least walk him to his car so they can talk. to julie, buds seems impatient and she realizes that she has never seen him act so angry. she remembers the first moment she saw ray, after he came back from california, and realizes she doesn't want to date bud anymore because she will always have feelings for ray. when they get to bud's car, he reveals that his name is really collingsworth wilson and that he was david gregg's half brother. he tells julie that he found out who had run down his little brother by asking a man who sold julie the flowers she sent to david's funeral. he then starts to choke her. julie is to the point of passing out when ray saves her by beating bud (collie) with a flashlight. when the paramedics show up, they tell julie and ray about helen's accident. helen sent them to julie's house, saying there would be someone trying to kill her. julie then asks ray how he knew of bud intending to kill her and he tells her that barry called him earlier and released him from the pact. after the phone call, he realized who bud was. then julie asks ray why bud never tried to hurt him. ray answers, "he did, tonight. he knew the worst thing for me would be to stay alive in a world without you." ||| 7 ||| 6
jack tagger, aged forty-six, is an obituary writer for the union-register (a fictitious south florida newspaper). he becomes excited on seeing a death notice for james bradley stomarti aka jimmy stoma, lead man of the rock band jimmy and the slut puppies. jack interviews jimmy’s widow, pop singer cleo rio (her stage name comes from the rumor that she flashed a sight of her pubic area during one of her music videos), who says that jimmy died in a diving accident in the bahamas. cleo also plugs her new upcoming album, with a title song co-written by jimmy and herself. jimmy's sister janet tells him cleo lied: jimmy was working on his own comeback album. jack gets more suspicious when he visits jimmy’s corpse in a funeral home and find that no autopsy was performed on his body. however, before jack can call for an official autopsy, jimmy’s body is cremated. jack used to be an investigative reporter, but was demoted to the obituary beat after publicly insulting race maggad iii, the ceo of the newspaper’s publishing company. his ambition is to climb back onto the front page by “yoking my byline to some famous stiff.” he tries to convince his editor, the “impossible” emma to let him investigate jimmy’s death, but she refuses. jack’s current job has taken its toll on his life; writing obituaries all day long, he has become morbidly obsessed with death, especially his own. each year, jack obsesses about people who died at his age, and about the fate of his deceased father, who disappeared when jack was young. these obsessions cost him his favorite girlfriend, anne. parked outside cleo’s condominium one night, jack sees her with a young man, an obvious sex partner. emma relents and gives jack a week to investigate jimmy's death. jack tracks down jay burns, the slut puppies’ old keyboardist, and jimmy’s dive partner. jay is heavily stoned, but to jack it is obvious he is lying about something. later that night, a burglar breaks into jack’s apartment. jack attacks him with the frozen corpse of a dead savannah monitor lizard which he keeps in his freezer. jack is beaten unconscious, but the burglar disappears. a few hours later, two police detectives show up and tell him jay burns has been found murdered. his apartment trashed, jack goes to stay with emma. they decide to search the boat where he interviewed jay. after careful searching, they find an external hard drive concealed inside the false bottom of a scuba tank. jack is depressed to hear from his friend carla candilla, anne’s teenaged daughter, that anne is getting married again — worse, to a hack spy novelist. meeting her at a club, he catches sight of cleo's boyfriend, a man who calls himself "loreal" and claims to be her record producer. jack and emma are alarmed when janet disappears from her home. jack finds a small patch of blood on her carpet. with the help of jack's best friend, sports writer juan rodriguez, jack decrypts the hard drive and finds it contains master recordings for jimmy’s unfinished new album. listening to it, jack is still baffled in looking for a motive for jimmy’s murder, if he was murdered. the cruel fact is, to most of the music industry jimmy was a has-been. to jack’s surprise, emma spends the night with him at his apartment. a few days later, she excitedly tells him that another former slut puppy, tito negroponte, was shot but not killed in los angeles. jack flies to california and interviews the bass player, who puts his finger on why cleo killed jimmy: she wanted a song from his album, “shipwrecked heart” for herself. jack listens to the song, telling emma that cleo’s desperate to put out another hit before she fades from the scene, and jimmy’s song is better than anything she can write. still, jack admits that he can’t prove that cleo killed jimmy. cleo's bodyguard kidnaps emma, and she demands the master in exchange for her. at the climactic confrontation on lake okeechobee, jack and juan meet the bodyguard and loreal, and trade the master for emma. then the bodyguard tries to kill all of them, but ends up upending the airboat he’s driving, with fatal results. the day after the rescue is jack’s 47th birthday. carla calls from anne's wedding to wish him a happy one. jack’s mother sends him a card with a copy of his father’s obituary; she confesses that he died at age 46. (“see? you made it!”) janet resurfaces, saying she skipped town when cleo’s goons broke into her house. she confesses to jack that she switched the tags on a pair of coffins at the funeral home, meaning jimmy’s body wasn’t cremated, but is buried in the wrong man’s grave. at her request, the body is exhumed, and autopsied, and the pathologist finds that jimmy was drugged before diving off the boat, causing him to pass out underwater and drown. cleo is arrested, tried, and convicted of murder; jack sails back onto the front page covering the story. jimmy’s posthumous album is a hit. a subplot focuses on jack’s ongoing feud with race maggad iii, and the ailing state of the union-register since maggad bought it. maggad’s policy has been to increase the newspaper’s profits to the maximum by cutting down as much as possible on the actual gathering and reporting of news – less space in the paper devoted to news and more to advertisements, fewer reporters and editors employed, and stories that are deferential to business interests and lacking in depth. after jack insulted him at a shareholders’ meeting, maggad demoted jack to the obituary page, expecting him to quit in humiliation. instead, jack finds an ally in macarthur polk, the newspaper's former publisher. like jack, polk is furious about what maggad has done to his newspaper, and now holds a position of power, because he owns a large number of shares in maggad’s publicly-traded company, which maggad is desperate to buy back before two foreign companies initiate a hostile takeover. polk dies on the same night jack rescues emma. his will names jack trustee of his shares, with instructions that maggad can have the stock back, but only if he sells the union-register back to polk’s family. maggad reluctantly agrees. the new publisher, polk’s widow, restores the paper to its former glory. emma is promoted, and the novel ends as she is trying to talk jack back from his leave of absence from journalism. ||| 1 ||| 6
the story is set nine years after the failure of the discovery one mission to jupiter. a joint soviet-american crew, including heywood floyd from 2001, on the soviet spaceship alexei leonov (named after the famous cosmonaut) arrives to discover what went wrong with the earlier mission, to investigate the monolith in orbit around the planet, and to resolve the disappearance of david bowman. they hypothesize that much of this information is locked away on the now-abandoned discovery one. the soviets have an advanced new "sakharov" drive which will propel them to jupiter ahead of the american discovery two, so floyd is assigned to the leonov crew. however, a chinese space station rockets out of earth orbit, revealing itself to be the interplanetary spacecraft tsien, also aimed at jupiter. the leonov crewmembers think the chinese are on a one-way trip due to its speed, but floyd surmises that due to the large water content of europa they intend to land there and use the water content to refuel. the tsien's daring mission ends in failure, when it is destroyed by an indigenous life-form on europa. the only survivor radios the story to the leonov; it is presumed that he dies when his spacesuit air supply runs out. the leonov survives a dangerous aerobraking around jupiter and arrives at discovery. mission crewmember and hal 9000's creator, dr. chandra, reactivates the computer to ascertain the cause of his earlier aberrant behavior. after some time, floyd is speaking to a russian on board, who, for an instant, sees the monolith open again, into a stargate, as david bowman escapes from the monolith's universe back into ours. a sequence of scenes follows the explorations of david bowman, who has been transformed into a non-corporeal, energy-based life-form, much like the aliens controlling the monoliths. during his journey, the avatar of bowman travels to earth, making contact with significant individuals from his human past: he visits his mother and brushes her hair (shortly before she dies), and he appears to his ex-girlfriend on her television screen. in the novel, the aliens are using bowman as a probe to learn about humankind. he then returns to the jupiter system to explore beneath the ice of europa, where he finds aquatic life-forms, and under the clouds of jupiter, where he discovers gaseous life-forms. both are primitive, but the aliens deem the europan creatures to have evolutionary potential. an apparition of bowman appears before floyd, warning him that they must leave jupiter within 15 days. floyd has difficulty convincing the rest of the crew at first, but then the monolith vanishes from orbit and a mysterious dark spot appears on jupiter and begins to grow. hal's telescope observations reveal that the "great black spot" is, in fact, a vast population of monoliths, increasing at an exponential rate, which appear to be eating the planet. the leonov crew devises a plan to use the discovery as a "booster rocket", enabling them to return to earth ahead of schedule. unfortunately, hal and the discovery will be trapped in jupiter's orbit, with insufficient fuel to escape. the crew are worried that hal will have the same neuroses on discovering that he will be abandoned yet again, so chandra must convince hal that the human crew is in danger. the leonov crew flees jupiter as the swarm of monoliths spread to engulf the planet. by acting as self-replicating 'von neumann' machines, these monoliths increase jupiter's density until the planet achieves nuclear fusion, becoming a small star. in the novel, this obliterates the primitive life forms inhabiting the jovian atmosphere, which the monoliths' controllers had deemed less worthy than the aquatic life of europa. as jupiter is about to transform, bowman returns to discovery to give hal a last order to carry out. hal begins repeatedly broadcasting the message the creation of the new star, which earth eventually names lucifer, destroys discovery. however, in appreciation for hal's help, bowman has the aliens which control the monoliths remove hal's artificial intelligence from discoverys computer core and transform him into the same kind of life form as david bowman, and becomes his companion. the book ends with a brief epilogue, which takes place in ad 20,001. by this time, the europans have evolved into a species that has developed a primitive civilization, most likely with assistance from a monolith. they are not described in detail, though they are said to have "tendril"-like limbs. they regard the star lucifer (formerly the planet jupiter) as their primary sun, referring to ours as "the cold sun". though their settlements are concentrated primarily in the hemisphere of europa which is constantly bathed in lucifer's rays, some europans have begun in recent generations to explore the farside, the hemisphere facing away from lucifer, which is still covered in ice. there they may witness the spectacle of night, unknown on the other side of europa, when the cold sun sets. the europans who explore the farside have been carefully observing the night sky and have begun to develop a mythology based on their observations. they correctly believe that lucifer was not always there. they believe that the cold sun was its brother and was condemned to march around the sky for a crime. the europans also see three other major bodies in the sky. one seems to be constantly engulfed in fire, and the other two have lights on them which are gradually spreading. these three bodies are the moons io, callisto, and ganymede, the latter two of which are presently being colonized by humans. humans have been attempting to explore europa ever since lucifer was created in 2010. however, none of these attempts has been successful. every probe that has attempted to land on europa has been destroyed in the atmosphere; as it is later shown in 2061 and 3001 manned spacecraft that attempt to land have been instead diverted by an external force. the debris from every probe falls to the surface of the planet, and the debris from some of the first ships to be destroyed is venerated by the europans. finally, there is a monolith on the planet, which is worshipped by the europans more than anything else. the europans assume, correctly, that the monolith is what keeps humans at bay. dave bowman and hal lie dormant in this monolith. the monolith is the guardian of europa, and will continue to prevent contact between humans and europans for as long as it sees fit. ||| 5 ||| 5

the story is told by the 10-year old protagonist, johnny briggs, who receives an army of toy nutcracker men from his father, a toymaker. the battles that take place during the first world war seem eerily similar to the battles that johnny enacts with his nutcracker soldiers, and johnny eventually comes to think that he is controlling the outcome of the war with every battle that he plays out. the part of the story taking place in france where johnny's father has enlisted is told mainly through letters sent back home to his family. through the letters it is possible to tell that the novel takes place from around october 25 until december 26, 1914. at the beginning of the book johnny and his family live in london, however johnny is sent to live with his aunt ivy in the town of cliffe soon after his father enlists. his mother moves to the town of woolwich, also sending letters to johnny every chapter, to help support the war by getting a job making weaponry in a factory. a main theme of the book is the pointlessness and irrationality of war. after the protagonist, johnny briggs, misses school for two days in order to have more time to build his guy fawkes, he is forced to spend every wednesday and saturday afternoon at his teacher's house. there, his teacher, mr. tuttle, tutors him on classic literature, mainly the iliad. they both draw direct parallels between the events of world war i and the events of homer's novel. it is during the beginning of the book that he is bullied, but when saved by sarah is entirely ungrateful and says "a girl for a friend is like no friend at all." this is why he leaves the school. when she saves him from being thrown in the fire he starts to see her as a friend. at the beginning of the book, johnny's father appears enthusiastic about going to war, so much that at the beginning he is frustrated that he lacks the half-inch of height required to enlist. after the required height is lowered, he joins the war and is moved to the front line afterward. as the war continues, it takes its toll on johnny's father's health, physique, and mentality. johnny's father sends his son a newly whittled and painted soldier with every letter, but his creations appear increasingly grotesque throughout the book. this is reflected in the model of himself that he had sent. the brown paint of his clothes turns a moldy green, the wide grin on its face fades to a grim, mournful expression, a hairline crack comes down his chest, and a knothole begins to form in its chest. the book comes to a close when johnny stops playing with his nutcracker soldiers, and brings them together for the christmas truce of 1914. the war continues without johnny's interference, and his father returns four years later in 1918. johnny's mother dies from sulfur poisoning in 1923, demonstrating that some of the most valiant sacrifices of world war i came not from the front lines, but from the work force at home. ||| 0 ||| 0

the novel is set in 1963, eighteen years following the end of the alternate world war ii shown in the worldwar series. earl warren is president of the united states, vyacheslav molotov is the premier of the soviet union, and heinrich himmler leads nazi germany. smaller countries remain independent, such as the republic of ireland and imperial japan, which still controls portions of its world war ii-era empire. a few isolated areas are still held by charles de gaulle's free france, and in german-occupied france the french resistance remains active. at the start of the novel, the colonization fleet of the race enters the solar system, bringing with them eighty to one hundred million colonists for settling on earth. as the fleet enters earth orbit, a human satellite unleashes a nuclear attack that kills millions. as germany, the ussr, and the united states each have large-scale space capability, any of the three nations may have been responsible for the attack. all three deny it when furious race leaders demand answers, but in truth two of the three human nations are as much unaware of the attacker's identity as the race. in addition, while there is peace between the independent human nations and the race- albeit an uneasy one- mao zedong and ruhollah khomeini continue to lead popular resistance to the invaders in china and the middle east, respectively. race efforts to wage a counter-insurgency war in those regions are frustrated by their lack of familiarity with such warfare and a near-total lack of support from the human population. the race also becomes aware of subtle support of these resistance movements by germany, the united states, and the ussr, but as the race are unable to prove it nothing can be done to stop them. meanwhile, the race colonists, who expected to encounter an earth that was already conquered with the natives still at medieval levels of advancement, have to deal with the consequences of the cold war with the humans. the fleet brings with it not only the first civilians, but also the first race females, both of which cause tension among the male soldiers who formed the invasion force. to the race males, ginger is a euphoric drug; to the females, it causes them to go into estrus, throwing race forces on earth into social chaos. worse still for the commanding fleetlord of the race forces on earth is a sharp upswing in armed revolts in the middle east and in china; at the novel's end khomeini's guerrillas have staged several successful ambushes against race patrols, while resistance forces under mao zedong storm the forbidden city. ||| 5 ||| 5

a canticle for leibowitz opens 600 years after 20th&nbsp;century civilization has been destroyed by a global nuclear war, known as the "flame deluge". the text reveals that as a result of the war there was a violent backlash against the culture of advanced knowledge and technology that had led to the development of nuclear weapons. during this backlash, called the "simplification," anyone of learning, and eventually anyone who could even read, was likely to be killed by rampaging mobs, who proudly took on the name of "simpletons". illiteracy became almost universal, and books were destroyed en masse. isaac edward leibowitz had been a jewish electrical engineer working for the united states military. surviving the war, he converted to roman catholicism and founded a monastic order, the "albertian order of leibowitz", dedicated to preserving knowledge by hiding books, smuggling them to safety (booklegging), memorizing, and copying them. the order's abbey is located in the american southwestern desert, near the military base where leibowitz had worked before the war, on an old road that may have been "a portion of the shortest route from the great salt lake to old el paso." leibowitz was eventually betrayed and martyred. later beatified by the roman catholic church, he became a candidate for sainthood. centuries after his death, the abbey is still preserving the "memorabilia", the collected writings that have survived the flame deluge and the simplification, in the hope that they will help future generations reclaim forgotten science. the story is structured in three parts titled: "fiat homo", "fiat lux", and "fiat voluntas tua". the parts are separated by periods of six centuries each. in the 26th&nbsp;century, a 17-year-old novice named brother francis gerard is on a vigil in the desert. while searching for a rock to complete a shelter brother francis encounters a wanderer, apparently looking for the abbey, who inscribes hebrew on a rock that appears the perfect fit for the shelter. when brother francis removes the rock he discovers the entrance to an ancient fallout shelter containing "relics", such as handwritten notes on crumbling memo pads bearing cryptic texts resembling a 20th-century shopping list. he soon realizes that these notes appear to have been written by leibowitz, his order's founder. the discovery of the ancient documents causes an uproar at the monastery, as the other monks speculate that the relics once belonged to leibowitz. brother francis' account of the wanderer, who ultimately never turned up at the abbey, is also greatly embellished by the other monks amid rumours that he was an apparition of leibowitz himself; francis strenuously denies the embellishments, but equally persistently refuses to deny that the encounter occurred, despite the lack of other witnesses. abbot arkos, the head of the monastery, worries that the discovery of so many potentially holy relics in such a short period may cause delays in leibowitz's canonization process. francis is banished back to the desert to complete his vigil and defuse the sensationalism. many years later the abbey is visited by monsignors aguerra (god's advocate) and flaught (the devil's advocate), the church's investigators in the case for leibowitz's sainthood. leibowitz is eventually canonized as saint leibowitz &ndash; based partly on the evidence francis discovered in the shelter &ndash; and brother francis is sent to new rome to represent the order at the canonization mass. he takes the documents found in the shelter and an illumination of one of the documents on which he has spent years working, a gift to the pope. on route, he is robbed and his illumination taken. francis completes the journey to new rome and is granted an audience with the pope. francis presents the pope with the remaining documents and the pope comforts francis by giving him gold with which to ransom back the illumination; however, francis is murdered during his return trip by "misborn" people (the "pope's children"), receiving an arrow in the face. the wanderer discovers and buries francis's body. (the book then focuses on the vultures who were denied their meal; they fly over the great plains and find much food near the red river until a city-state, based in texarkana, rises). in 3174, the albertian order of st. leibowitz is still preserving the half-understood knowledge from before the flame deluge and the subsequent age of simplification. the new dark age is ending, however, and a new renaissance is beginning. thon taddeo pfardentrott, a highly regarded secular scholar, is sent by his cousin hannegan, mayor of texarkana, to the abbey. thon taddeo, frequently compared to albert einstein, is interested in the order's preserved collection of memorabilia. at the abbey, brother kornhoer, a talented engineer, has just finished work on a "generator of electrical essences", a treadmill-powered electrical generator that powers an arc lamp. he gives credit for the generator to work done by thon taddeo. after arriving at the monastery, thon taddeo, by studying the memorabilia, makes several major "discoveries", and asks the abbot to allow the memorabilia to be removed to texarkana. the abbot dom paulo refuses, stating he can continue his research at the abbey. before departing, the thon comments that it could take decades to finish analyzing the memorabilia. meanwhile, hannegan makes an alliance with the kingdom of laredo and the neighboring, relatively civilized city-states against the threat of attack from the nomadic warriors. hannegan, however, is manipulating the regional politics to effectively neutralize all of his enemies, leaving him in control of the entire region. monsignor apollo, the papal nuncio to hannegan's court, sends word to new rome that hannegan intends to attack the empire of denver next, and that he intends to use the abbey as a base of operations from which to conduct the campaign. for his actions, apollo is executed, and hannegan initiates a church schism, declaring loyalty to the pope to be punishable by death. the church excommunicates hannegan. it is the year 3781, and mankind has nuclear energy and weapons again, as well as starships and extra-solar colonies. two world superpowers, the asian coalition and the atlantic confederacy, have been embroiled in a cold war for 50 years. the leibowitzan order's mission of preserving the memorabilia has expanded to the preservation of all knowledge. rumors that both sides are assembling nuclear weapons in space and that a nuclear weapon has been detonated increase public and international tensions. at the abbey, the current abbot, dom jethras zerchi, recommends to new rome that the church reactivate the quo peregrinatur grex pastor secum ("whither wanders the flock, the shepherd is with them") contingency plans involving "certain vehicles" the church has had since 3756. a "nuclear incident" occurs in the asian coalition city of itu wan: an underground nuclear explosion has destroyed the city, and the atlantic confederacy counters by firing a "warning shot" over the south pacific. new rome tells zerchi to proceed with quo peregrinatur and plan for departure within three days. he appoints brother joshua as mission leader, telling him that this is an emergency plan for perpetuating the church on the colony planets in the event of a nuclear war on earth. the order's memorabilia will also accompany the mission. that night the atlantic confederacy launches an assault against asian coalition space platforms. the asian coalition responds by using a nuclear weapon against the confederacy capital city of texarkana. a ten-day cease-fire is issued by the world court. brother joshua and the space-trained monks and priests depart on a secret, chartered flight for new rome, hoping to leave earth on the starship before the cease-fire ends. during the cease-fire, the abbey offers shelter to refugees fleeing the regions affected by fallout, which results in a battle of wills over euthanasia between the abbot and a doctor from a government emergency response camp. the war resumes and a nuclear explosion occurs near the abbey. abbot zerchi tries to flee to safety, bringing with him the abbey's ciborium containing consecrated hosts, but it is too late. he is trapped by the falling walls of the abbey and finds himself lying under tons of rock and bones as the abbey's ancient crypts disgorge their contents. among them is a skull with an arrow's shaft protruding from its forehead (presumably that of brother francis gerard from the first section of the book). as he lies dying under the abbey's rubble, zerchi is startled to encounter mrs grales/rachel, a bicephalous tomato peddler and mutant. however, mrs. grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, and may be dying herself. as zerchi tries to conditionally baptize rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the eucharist to him. it is implied that she is, like the virgin mary, exempt from original sin. zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle. after the abbot's death, the scene flashes to joshua and the quo peregrinatur crew launching as the nuclear explosions begin. joshua, the last crew member to board the starship, knocks the dirt from his sandals, murmuring "sic transit mundus" ("thus passes the world"). as a coda, there is a final vignette depicting the ecological aspects of the war: seabirds and fish succumb to the poisonous fallout, and a shark evades death only through moving to particularly deep water, where, it is noted, the shark was "very hungry that season." ||| 2 ||| 5
the story starts with the del valle family, focusing upon the youngest and the oldest daughters of the family, clara and rosa. the youngest daughter, clara del valle, has paranormal powers and keeps a detailed diary of her life. using her powers, clara predicts a death in the family. shortly after this, clara's green-haired sister, rosa the beautiful, is accidentally killed by poison intended for her father who is running for the senate. the young clara stumbles upon her sister's autopsy and afterwards, terrified, stops speaking, believing her premonition had caused her sister's death. rosa's fiancé, a poor miner named esteban trueba, is devastated and attempts to mend his broken heart by devoting his life to uplifting his family hacienda, tres marías. through a combination of intimidation and reward systems, he quickly earns/forces respect and labor from the fearful peasants and turns tres marías into a "model hacienda". he turns the first peasant who spoke to him upon arrival, pedro segundo, into his foreman, who quickly becomes the closest thing that trueba ever has to an actual friend during his life. however, unable to control himself, he rapes many of the peasant women, and his first victim, pancha garcía, becomes the mother of his bastard son, who would eventually become esteban garcía. esteban returns to the city to see his dying mother. after her death, esteban decides to fulfill her dying wish: for him to marry and have legitimate children. he goes to the del valle family to ask for clara's hand in marriage. clara accepts esteban's proposal; she herself has predicted her engagement two months prior, speaking for the first time in nine years. during the period of their engagement, esteban builds what everyone calls "the big house on the corner," a large mansion in the city where the trueba family will live for generations. after their wedding, esteban's sister férula comes to live with the newlyweds in the big house on the corner. férula develops a strong dedication to clara, which fulfills her need to serve others. however, esteban's wild desire to possess clara and to monopolize her love causes him to throw férula out of the house. she curses him, telling him that he will shrink in body and soul, and die like a dog. although she misses her sister-in-law, a passive and dreamy clara finds happiness in developing her psychic powers. spirits, artists, and spiritualists flock to the truebas' house. clara gives birth to a daughter named blanca and later, to twin boys jaime and nicolás. the family, which resides in the capital, stays at the hacienda during the summertime. upon arriving at tres marías for the first time, blanca immediately befriends a young boy named pedro tercero, who is the son of her father's foreman. during their teenage years, blanca and pedro tercero eventually become lovers. after an earthquake that destroys part of the hacienda and leaves esteban injured, the truebas move permanently to las tres marías. clara spends her time teaching and helping peasant children, while blanca is sent to a convent school and the twin boys back to an english boarding school, both of which are located in the city. blanca fakes an illness so as to be sent back to las tres marías, where she can be with pedro tercero. life runs smoothly until pedro tercero is banished from the hacienda by esteban, on account of his revolutionary communist/socialist ideas. a visiting french count to the hacienda, jean de satigny, reveals blanca's nightly romps with pedro tercero to her father. esteban furiously goes after his daughter and brutally whips her. when clara expresses horror at his actions, esteban slaps her, knocking out her front teeth. clara decides to never speak to him again, reclaims her maiden name and moves out of tres marías and back to the city, taking blanca with her. esteban, furious and lonely, blames pedro tercero for the whole matter; putting a price on the boy's head with the local corrupt police. at this point, pedro segundo deserts esteban, telling him he does not want to be around when trueba inevitably catches his son. enraged by pedro segundo's departure, trueba begins hunting for pedro tercero himself, eventually tracking him down to a small shack near his hacienda. he only succeeds in cutting off three of pedro's fingers, and is filled with regret for his uncontrollable furies. jaime becomes an empathetic doctor while crafty nicolás concocts money-making schemes. the two develop a strange relationship with a woman named amanda. nicolas and amanda are originally introduced to the story together, but split later on due to her pregnancy. jaime loves amanda dearly at this point but will never admit to his feelings around her. he agrees to help terminate her pregnancy not because his cowardly brother asked him to, but for the woman he cannot have. years later jaime and amanda meet again and jaime saves her from near death. amanda remembers jaime as the tender doctor and falls in love with him, but he realizes that she is not the same beautiful woman that bewitched him originally. he continues to have a relationship with amanda though he does not love her. blanca finds out she is pregnant with pedro tercero's child. esteban, desperate to save the family honor, gets blanca to marry the french count by telling her that he has killed pedro tercero. at first, blanca gets along with her new husband, but she leaves him when she discovers his participation in sexual fantasies with the servants. blanca quietly returns to the trueba household and names her daughter, who has rosa's green hair, alba. clara predicts that alba will have a very happy future and good luck. her future lover, miguel, happens to watch her birth, as he had been living in the trueba house with his sister, amanda. they move out shortly after alba's birth. esteban trueba eventually moves to the trueba house in the capital as well, although he continues to spend periods of time in tres marías. he becomes isolated from every member of his family except for little alba, whom he is very fond of. esteban runs as a senator for the conservative party but is nervous about whether or not he will win. clara speaks to him, through signs, informing him that "those who have always won will win again" - this becomes his motto. clara then begins to speak to esteban through signs, although she keeps her promise and never actually speaks to him again. a few years later, clara dies peacefully and esteban is overwhelmed with grief. alba is a solitary child who enjoys playing make-believe in the basement of the house and painting the walls of her room. blanca has become very poor since leaving jean de satigny's house, getting a small income out of selling pottery and giving pottery classes to mentally handicapped children, and is once again dating pedro tercero, now a revolutionary singer/songwriter. alba and pedro are fond of each other, but do not know they are father and daughter, although pedro suspects this. alba is also fond of her uncles. nicolás is eventually kicked out by his father, moving, supposedly, to north america. when she is older, alba attends a local college where she meets miguel, now a grown man, and becomes his lover. miguel is a revolutionary, and out of love for him, alba involves herself in student protests against the conservative government. after the victory of the people's party (a socialist movement), alba celebrates with miguel. fearing a communist dictatorship, esteban trueba and his fellow politicians plan a military coup of the socialist government. however, when the military coup is set into action, the military men relish their power and grow out of control. esteban's son jaime is killed by power-driven soldiers along with other supporters of the government. after the coup, people are regularly kidnapped and tortured. esteban helps blanca and pedro tercero flee to canada, where the couple finally find their happiness. the military regime attempts to eliminate all traces of opposition and eventually comes for alba. she is made the prisoner of colonel esteban garcía, the son of esteban trueba and pancha garcía's illegitimate son, and therefore grandson to esteban trueba. during an earlier visit to the trueba house, garcía molests alba as a child. in pure hatred of her privileged life and eventual inheritance, garcía tortures alba repeatedly, looking for information on miguel. he rapes her, thus completing the cycle that esteban trueba put into motion when he raped pancha garcía. when alba loses her will to live, she is visited by clara's spirit who tells her not to wish for death, since it can easily come, but to wish to live. esteban trueba manages to free alba with the help of miguel and tránsito soto, an old friend/prostitute from his days as a young man. after helping alba write their memoir, esteban trueba dies in the arms of alba, accompanied by clara's spirit; he is smiling, having avoided férula's prophecy that he will die like a dog. alba explains that she will not seek vengeance on those who have injured her, suggesting a hope that one day the human cycle of hate and revenge can be broken. alba writes the book to pass time while she waits for miguel and for the birth of her child. ||| 2 ||| 2
jim qwilleran is attempting to get his life back on track, starting with a new job; his old acquaintance, arch riker, is taking a chance. qwilleran became known as a journalist for covering crime, but his new job at the flux is hardly so glamorous: he's working on the art beat. the paper's resident art critic is the reclusive and decidedly unpopular one-handed man named george bonifield mountclemens iii. qwill visits mountclemens and meets koko, a male siamese cat who appears to be able to read, but only backwards. qwilleran rents a room from mountclemens and starts to take care of koko, who has rather delicate taste in eating. mountclemens adores some local artists and despises others. one of the former is a young woman, zoe lambreth, whose husband owns the lambreth gallery, which showcases her works among others, including scrano, and zoe's protégé, nino. mountclemens has an argument with noel farhar, the director of an art museum; the museum lost a million-dollar deal after a bad review from mountclemens, and as a result farhar is retiring. one evening, qwill is relaxing in the press club with his friend, the flux photographer odd bunsen, when bunsen is paged: there's been a murder at the lambreth gallery. specifically, it's the owner, earl lambreth, and the gallery was left in disarray, with paintings destroyed and furniture tossed about. qwill notices that a ghirotto painting, or rather half of one, is missing; intact, the painting of a ballerina and monkey would be worth $150,000, but lambreth's half, the ballerina, has disappeared. qwill attempts to comfort the attractive widow lambreth, who is being protected and cared for by a friend named butchy, also an artist and a teacher. a dagger goes missing from the art museum. mountclemens, just returned from a trip, does not seem very interested in earl's death. as an art writer, qwill goes to a "happening" featuring nino. nino's creations are made from things that people throw away, things that have meaning to him that others may not necessarily understand. the show ends disastrously, when one of nino's creations is knocked from its scaffolding, and nino falls to his death attempting to save it. qwill has more theories than real sympathy for the recently deceased. nino didn't like earl lambreth. butchy didn't like the friendship between zoe and nino. could butchy have pushed nino to his death? meanwhile, the dagger and the ghirotto are both found. defeated in possible conspiracy theories, qwill returns home to koko. koko leads qwill upstairs to mountclemens' flat, where they find mountclemens lying dead at the bottom of his fire escape. qwill continues to take care of the siamese, and the next day, koko leads him upstairs to retrieve his blue cushion and his favorite "mousie" toy. in the course of searching for the "mousie", qwill finds mountclemens' stash of paintings, which includes a half-painting of a monkey. it is the match to the ghirotto ballerina that earl lambreth owned. mountclemens had offered to buy earl's half from him, not letting on that he owned the other half. however, earl had something else mountclemens wanted, or rather someone—zoe had been leading the critic on by flirting with him in order to stay in his good graces. mountclemens might have killed earl, but his name is on the airline's list of passengers, and qwill believes this proves he was out of town. zoe interrupts qwill's contemplation, and he invites her to the press club for lunch. at the press club, zoe gives credence to qwill's theories. she tells him mountclemens owned the lambreth gallery, and earl had been maintaining two sets of books, one real and one falsified. earl had threatened to expose mountclemens in order to stop his relationship with zoe. this would have put mountclemens in jail. zoe believes mountclemens killed earl, and had someone fly under his name to provide himself with an alibi. returning to the apartment, qwill is in a quiet mood. could zoe have killed mountclemens? she didn't seem unhappy to see the art critic dead. koko leads qwill to the old apartment again, where he knocks a knife off the counter. in the broom closet is a flashlight, but why wasn't there one by mountclemens' body? unless in being one handed, mountclemens chose a knife over a flashlight? yet he wasn't wearing his false hand, and the art critic was vain enough to wear it if he had an assignation with zoe. koko growls at the door of the abandoned studio, and qwill enters to find that several of the paintings have vanished, and the remaining ones are highly valuable scranos. as koko runs his nose over the signature backwards (onarcs), the painter qwill knew as narx entered. narx reached for the knife lying on the table, but koko deflects his attack by leaping upon him and qwill hits narx with the flashlight. back at the press club, qwill recounted the adventure, pointing out that narx drew robotic drawings that resembled himself, and was clearly also o. narx since the paintings' texture was so similar. koko's reading the signature backwards merely confirmed this. though mountclemens could no longer paint or draw when he lost his hand, he could still instruct others, and scrano had painted for him.in the art critic's last review, he said there would be no more art coming from scrano which led qwill to think that mountclemens had intended on killing him, but narx killed mountclemens. once scrano woke up, he confirmed qwill's story. qwill had, however, guessed wrong about butchy and zoe. butchy had tried to save nino and hurt herself in the process. zoe had had murderous intent but never followed up on it. upon his return to the apartment, qwill asked koko: had it been all a coincidence, when koko led him up to the closet with the monkey painting was it simply for a lost toy? koko gave the man no answers, just removed an itch with a hind paw and a contented look. ||| 3 ||| 6
*chapter 1 - eric john stark, outland mercenary, and his companion camar the thief, are travelling in the wilderness that surrounds the northern polar cap of mars, trying to get to camar's home city of kushat. camar has been mortally wounded in a guerrilla campaign and wants to return home before he dies. unable to make it, he confesses that he has stolen the holy talisman of ban cruach from kushat, which keeps the city safe. it is hidden inside a boss on his belt. stark promises to take the talisman back to kushat for camar. examining the talisman, he presses it to his forehead and receives visions of a tower, a city in the ice, and a pass - the memories of ban cruach. soon after he puts the talisman back in the belt, he is approached by the riders of mekh, a barbarian tribe that lives in the hills between him and kushat. *chapter 2 - the riders of mekh arrest and plunder stark, except for his clothes and camar's belt. they lead him to their camp in a valley several days northward. there they bring him before the masked and fully armored lord ciaran. ciaran interrogates stark and announces his plan to besiege kushat. stark is uncooperative and demands to see ciaran's face. ciaran turns him over to thord, his previous capturer. *chapter 3 - stark is tied to a scaffold and scourged by thord. when thord comes near him, stark bits his hand hard enough to break his thumb. when thord tries to kill stark for this, ciaran kills thord for disobedience. stark feigns unconsciousness, despite being prodded by spears. when he is cut down, stark gets a spear, kills several riders, and escapes on a mount. after riding for three days through a snowy wasteland marked by a series of towers, he reaches kushat, a city standing in front of a pass through a scarp. *chapter 4 - stark enters kushat and meets thanis. he his challenged by lugh, whom he warns about the imminent attack by mekh. lugh leads stark to the guard captain, who dismisses stark's claims, but is persuaded to pass the warning on to the nobility. he gives stark into the custody of thanis, who takes him to her home. stark sleeps, only to be wakened by thanis' brother balin, who tells him that soldiers have come, and warns him not to speak of the talisman. a nobleman, rogain, enters with a group of soldiers and questions stark about the invasion. rogain at last agrees to put kushat in arms. after rogain and his men leave, balin and thanis explain that they found the talisman in camar's belt, and they agree not to return it to the men of kushat. stark goes to sleep again. just before dawn he wakes and goes up on kushat's wall. *chapter 5 - in the morning, the clans of mekh, led by ciaran, attack kushat. despite resistance, mekh takes the wall and breaches its gate. stark, who had been fighting on the wall, goes down to face ciaran in single combat. as they fight, stark tears ciaran's mask off, revealing her to be a red-haired woman. *chapter 6 - despite this revelation, in the moment of victory, ciaran is able to retain the loyalty of her followers. as the soldiers of kushat charge and are beaten back, stark manages to escape the mêlée. stark hides in kushat until the looting commences. *chapter 7 - *chapter 8 - *chapter 9 - *chapter 1 - eric john stark, outland mercenary, and his companion camar the thief, are travelling in the wilderness that surrounds the northern polar cap of mars, trying to get to camar's home city of kushat. camar has been mortally wounded in a guerrilla campaign and wants to return home before he dies. unable to make it, he confesses that he has stolen the holy talisman of ban cruach from kushat, which keeps the city safe. it is hidden inside a boss on his belt. stark promises to take the talisman back to kushat for camar. examining the talisman, he hears tiny, unintelligible voices that alarm him. soon after he puts the talisman back in the belt, he is approached by the riders of mekh, a barbarian tribe that lives in the hills between him and kushat. *chapter 2 - *chapter 3 - *chapter 4 - *chapter 5 - *chapter 6 - *chapter 7 - *chapter 8 - *chapter 9 - *chapter 10 - *chapter 11 - *chapter 12 - *chapter 13 - *chapter 14 - *chapter 15 - the talisman expansion is far more ambitious than the one of the secret of sinharat; for one thing, the resulting story is about a third longer than sinharat. despite the comprehensiveness of the revision, the treatment of the earlier chapters, where more of the original text is retained, is sometimes clumsy and the motivation of the changes is sometimes unclear. in at least one place there is a significant editorial faux pas -- a passage in which an important character is introduced is omitted, and the character is later referred to by name without the connection between name and person having ever been made explicit. the murderously insane aliens of talisman are a very unusual invention for brackett, and it may be that the hand of hamilton is seen at work here. ban cruach also loses much of his mythical glamor in talisman, which is something of a let-down, though it does work as a "twist" conclusion. ||| 2 ||| 2
abarrach, the world of stone is just that: lava, stone, poisonous fumes, and precious little food that can be grown. the peoples of abarrach rely on giant rune-inscribed stone pillars called colossi to provide warmth and breathable atmosphere, but the colossi have been failing slowly for many years. the mensch have all died out, and the only remaining people &mdash; all of them sartan &mdash; are far reduced in power; most of their innate magic is consumed with simply keeping them alive. to bolster their numbers, they have taken to the forbidden art of necromancy: the raising of the dead. these reanimated corpses are not very smart, but they're better than nothing. haplo is sent to this world and discovers, much to his alarm, that alfred has somehow infiltrated the nexus and stowed away on his ship. before he can do anything, however, the vessel passes through death's gate, and their consciousnesses switch; the two are forced to relive each other's most painful memories: haplo, as a boy of seven, seeing the slaughtered bodies of his parents and being taught that it is all the fault of the sartan; and alfred, waking up to find that he is the only sartan left alive on arianus... for all he knows, the only one in all the worlds. they have been forced to walk in each other's shoes, and the two are never able to look at each other with quite the same hatred (in haplo's case) or fear (in alfred's) as before. on abarrach, alfred is initially overjoyed to meet living sartan, even bastardized ones, but is appalled at the state of things; the sartan rune-language, highly evocative, is laden with images of death when spoken by abarrach natives. he is even more horrified that they practice necromancy. it was taught that, when one is revived untimely, another dies untimely, and (though the series never spells it out) it is implied that abarrach's necromancy is the reason most sartan died during stasis. and the sartan here regard alfred with hungry eyes: he has powers, magics, abilities that they had long forgotten existed, and they want what he has. even his simplest magic is beyond them. haplo and alfred make the acquaintance of prince edmund, who is leading his ragged band of people to the "greener" pastures around abarrach's capital city (necropolis), and his chief necromancer, baltazar. in the realm of kairn necros, they meet minor nobles and necromancers jonathan and jera, just married and very clearly in love with each other. haplo and edmund meet with the dynast kleitus xiv, who is not a pleasant man; he orders edmund executed on a whim, and imprisons haplo when it becomes clear that he, too, still knows the secrets of rune-magic. kleitus poisons haplo so that the corpse will be left undamaged, the runes free to be studied at kleitus's leisure. alfred, jonathan, and jera manage to free haplo, but jera is killed, and jonathan revives her immediately without waiting the customary three days to let her soul depart entirely. jera now becomes a lazar (a reference to lazarus of the bible), a revived dead who still retains her intelligence and personality because her soul is so closely bound to the body... and whose existence is endless torment, caught between life and death. haplo, alfred, and jonathan flee with the dead edmund and jera from kleitus and his dead soldiers, and end up in a curious chamber: heavily warded, full of the skeletal remains of people who apparently killed each other or even themselves, with seven sealed doors spaced evenly around its perimeter and a white wooden table in the middle. it is called the chamber of the damned. once rebels gathered here, and were ambushed and killed here by an ancestor of kleitus, but he and all his forces were struck down by an unseen hand on the very spot. the chamber is entirely peaceful and seems to resist violence, and alfred (and haplo too, though he will not admit it) feels for a moment as if in the presence of a higher power. while alfred and haplo view this ancient scene, jera is calling to the dead soldiers that kleitus brings with him. he arrives at the chamber, only to be killed and resurrected as a lazar by jera. she begins to reanimate many new lazar, culminating in a slaughter of nearly the entire population of the city. the living (and edmund) are forced to run again, trying to reach haplo's ship to flee abarrach, as well as stop the dead from breaking through its runes to enter the other worlds and kill all the living. jonathan sacrifices himself to aid their escape, and is murdered and turned into a lazar at his wife's hands; prince edmund, on the other hand, demonstrates how a lazar can surrender his/her anger and find true death by doing so. baltazar gathers his remaining people on the outskirts of the city, in for the long haul, though the new army of lazar will make life difficult. haplo and alfred escape in haplo's ship, and haplo, driven by odd impulses, gives alfred a chance to jump ship before he returns to the nexus and his lord. ||| 2 ||| 2
intelligence analyst rachel sexton works for the nro (national reconnaissance office). her father, senator sedgewick sexton, is a presidential candidate who is more popular than incumbent president of the united states zachary herney. the president sends her to the arctic as part of a team of experts to confirm and authenticate findings made by nasa deep within the milne ice shelf on ellesmere island. nasa's new polar orbiting density scanner (pods), part of the earth observation system (eos), a collection of satellites monitoring the globe for signs of large-scale change, has found an extremely dense spot in the milne ice shelf. at this spot nasa discovers a very dense meteorite. in it are insect fossils very similar to, but not the same as, species on earth. nasa claims this as proof of extraterrestrial life. the find is something nasa needs in the light of recent failures. senator sexton uses these failures as an example of government overspending to further his campaign; he wants to abolish nasa and direct the funding toward public schools instead. in order to ensure that the discovery is not tarnished by the reputation that nasa has developed, the president sends four leading civilian scientists (michael tolland, a famous oceanographer and tv personality; corky marlinson, a brilliant but eccentric astrophysicist; norah mangor, a prickly glaciologist and wailee ming, a palaeontologist) to the arctic to verify the meteorite's authenticity. a delta force team is also observing the discovery, monitoring the nasa staff for an unknown commander. ming observes an irregularity within the pit from which the meteorite was extracted. he reaches into the water to obtain a sample and falls in due to an attack by microbots operated by the delta force team. he soon drowns at the bottom of the pit. when tolland sees the irregularity, he shares it with corky marlinson and rachel sexton. they report it to mangor, who confirms that there is sea water in what should be a closed area with only freshwater. the four go outside to scan the ice from a distance. the scan shows ming's body in the water and a column of frozen sea ice beneath the meteorite where it was drilled up into the glacier. upon discovering this, the four are attacked by the delta force team, leaving norah mangor dead. sexton, tolland and marlinson escape and are picked up by the navy submarine uss charlotte. the delta force team believes them to be dead, leaving the scientists a chance to tell the president's advisor and rachel's boss at the nro about their discovery, and the subsequent attack. rachel's boss, nro director william pickering, has them airlifted from the sub to a chopper which escorts them away from the meteorite discovery site. senator sexton's true motive for wanting to abolish nasa is revealed to be his work for the interests of private corporations from the space frontier foundation, who wish to profit off of space exploration in the event that nasa is dismantled. rachel is unaware of this, and believes that the president and nasa are part of the conspiracy to kill them. if so, their motive would be to cover up evidence that the meteorite is fake and solely designed to gain support for the incumbent president in the upcoming election. aboard tolland's ship off the new jersey coast, where the delta force arrives via helicopter to kill them, rachel sends a fax message to her father asking for help. sexton, tolland, and marlinson work together to kill the delta force squad in self-defense. rachel is surprised to see pickering emerging from the helicopter, revealing that he is the commander of the delta force squad. he tells rachel about her father's true motivations for becoming president, and that he (pickering) masterminded the fake meteorite to hurt senator sexton's campaign, protecting the american people in his eyes. when the president sent the civilian team to verify the authenticity of the meteorite, pickering realized that they would discover his plot and that they needed to be eliminated at all costs. rachel attempts to reason with pickering, saying that murder is not a justifiable way of solving the problem. pickering, however, says that he is "sacrificing a few to save many", and that he will finish the job personally. pickering shoots at the three with a machine gun, but they manage to get off of the ship. the helicopter slides off the ship into the sea, sinking to the bottom. the intense heat at the bottom ignites the hellfire missiles still on the helicopter, tearing the existent magma plume at the bottom of the sea, creating a water vortex. the ship is sucked in by the vortex, and pickering is implied to have been killed in the wreck. senator sexton then reads the fax message his daughter sent him to the public, possibly incriminating the president and nasa. however, the truth eventually comes to light about senator sexton's ulterior motives and pickering's meteorite plot, securing zachary herney a second term as president. by the end of the story, michael and rachel have developed a romantic relationship. ||| 5 ||| 5

jody baxter lives with his parents, ory and ezra "penny" baxter, in the animal-filled central florida backwoods at the end of the 19th century. his parents had six other children prior to jody, but they died in infancy which makes it difficult for ma baxter to bond with jody. jody loves the outdoors and loves his family. he has wanted a pet for as long as he can remember, yet his mother ory says they only have enough food to feed themselves. a subplot involves the hunt for an old bear named slewfoot that randomly attacks the baxter livestock. later the baxters and forresters get in a fight about the bear, and continue to fight about nearly anything. the forresters steal the baxters' pigs and while penny and jody are out searching for their stolen pigs, penny is bitten by a rattlesnake in the arm. penny shoots a doe to use its liver to draw out the snake's poison. penny recovers, but the doe leaves behind a fawn. jody adopts the fawn, whom he names flag, and it becomes his constant companion. the story revolves around the life of jody as he grows to adolescence along with the fawn. the plot also centers on the conflicts of the young boy as he struggles with strained relationships, hunger, death (of his childhood companion, fodder-wing forrester, due to sickness), and the capriciousness of nature through a catastrophic flood. throughout, the baxter family is in contrast to their uncouth neighbors the forresters, and the baxters' more refined relatives in the village of volusia. jody experiences tender moments with his family, his fawn, and their neighbors and relatives. along with his father, he comes face-to-face with the rough life of a farmer and hunter. as jody takes his final steps into maturity, he is forced to make a desperate choice between his pet flag and his family. the parents realize that the now-adult flag is endangering their very survival, as he persists in eating the corn crop which the family is relying on for their food the next winter. jody's father orders him to take flag into the woods and shoot him, but jody cannot bring himself to do it. when his mother shoots the deer and wounds him, jody is then forced to shoot flag in the neck himself. in anger at his mother, jody runs away, only to come face-to-face with the true meaning of hunger, loneliness, and fear. after a failed attempt to run away in a broken-down canoe, he is picked up by a mail ship and dropped off in volusia. in the end, jody returns home and assumes his role as the emerging caregiver to his family and their land. ||| 0 ||| 2
although the plot of the story is modelled on the classic ratiocination stories of doyle, there are two separate mysteries in the book, only one of which the holmes character is able to solve by the end. the story opens with the description of a chance encounter between the old man and the young boy linus steinman, who, we find out moments later, is a german-jewish refugee staying with a local anglican priest and his family. because the parrot sitting on the boy's shoulder is in the habit of rattling off german numbers in no obvious order — "zwei eins sieben fünf vier sieben drei" ("two one seven five four seven three") — the old man quickly deduces the boy's reason for being in england. after we are introduced to the priest, his wife, son and two lodgers sitting at dinner, we find out that the numbers may have some significance. one lodger speculates that the numbers are a military code of some kind and seeks to crack it. the other lodger, a mr. shane, from the british foreign office, pretends at dinner not to even notice the bird, which the family and linus call bruno. but because everyone else around the table is intensely interested in it, shane's behavior only heightens their suspicions. after mr. shane is found murdered the next morning and the parrot bruno has gone missing, the local inspector, michael bellows, recruits the old man to help solve the mystery. the old man, his interest piqued by the boy's strange attachment to his bird, agrees only to find the parrot — "if we should encounter the actual murderer along the way, well, then it will be so much the better for you," he says (ending chapter 3). although the holmes character succeeds in that endeavor, neither he nor anyone else in the book discovers what the true meaning of the numbers are, though there are clear implications of a solution. one hint, given by the author chabon, is that the numbers are often recited in the presence of trains, and indeed, the parrot calls it "the train song". another hint, revealed in the book's penultimate chapter, which is told from the perspective of bruno, is that the boy and his parrot used to visit an obergruppenführer while still in germany, where it is implied he learned the song. but the biggest hint of all is the book's title and the boy's dumbness. added to that, neither the parrot nor the boy ever voice the german numeral "null". ||| 6 ||| 6

the novel is set in a parallel world in which the existence of psychic powers has permitted the development of witchcraft into a science; in contrast, that of the physical sciences has languished, resulting in a modern culture reminiscent of our eighteenth century. witchcraft is hereditary but the ability to use it can be held by only one member of a family line at a time, being passed from mother to daughter at the daughter's loss of virginity. the daughter's lover then gains possession of her magical talisman, a jewel known as the blue star, which enables him to read the mind of anyone he looks in the eye. the catch is that he retains access to this power only so long as he keeps faith with his witch lover. the empire in which the action is set is comparable to the austrian one in our own history. the government bans witchcraft, which merely serves to drive its practitioners underground, where they can fall prey to the use and abuse of unscrupulous powerful or ambitious individuals. the protagonists are lalette asterhax, a hereditary witch, and rodvard bergelin, an ordinary government clerk who has been recruited into the radical conspiracy of the sons of the new day. rodvard, though attracted to the daughter of a baron, is commanded by his superiors to seduce lalette instead to gain the use of her blue star in the furtherance of their revolutionary aims. the witch is no more truly enamored of him than he is of her, but both fall in with the scheme for their own reasons, unaware of how much they are simply pawns in the larger scheme of things. everything soon goes bad, and the couple is forced to flee the empire. various adventures and complications ensue as they stray into one cause or acquaintance after another, gradually growing beyond their shallow, selfish roots into a greater understanding. ||| 2 ||| 2

the occupation authorities declared nagasaki (and hiroshima) off-limits to reporters. weller reports that he was the first outside observer to reach nagasaki, on september 6, 1945, four weeks following the u.s. atomic bombing of the city. he spent a total of three weeks in nagasaki and in the nearby allied p.o.w. camps — some of which he "opened", and revisits the series of news reports he published at the time about his experiences. the first dispatches by non-japanese reporters were filed by associated press correspondent vern haugland and new york times lawrence who visited nagasaki september 9, 1945. captain joe snyder, press officer with macarthur headquarters, in his book para(graph) trooper for macarthur: from the horse cavalry to the uss missouri 1997 chapter 16 "nagasaki inferno" pp199–209 describes "boarding a transport plane packed with reporters headed for nagasaki.[for example: photographers 1. see google image search nagasaki bernard hoffman (life magazine) 2. bettmann/corbis september 13, 1945 stanley troutman (acme war pool) 3. nagasaki and verso ]other officers and correspondents headed for hiroshima about the same time, so the world would soon know more than it was prepared to digest about the horrors of the atomic bomb. ... i toured the city with the ap's jim hutcheson, among others. he and i had become good friends since our narrow escape on corregidor. ... there were thousands of stories in nagasaki and our group saw many pitiful sights of people with radiation burns who, in dreadful agony, were slowly dying. the first thing japanese doctors asked was if american doctors had a cure for the bomb's effects on the human body. ... we received a report from ghq that american doctors were coming to nagasaki soon...." snyder acknowledges what he calls wilfrid burchett's "ingenuity" in successfully reporting from hiroshima. snyder does not mention george weller or any dispatches of george weller's from nagasaki. joe snyder [1983; owner and editor of the north missourian] and walter cronkite [1964; cbs] are both recipients of the missouri school of journalism honor medal. from the first days of the occupation reporters were cleared to cover freeing and rescue operations on behalf of these prisoners. weller comments: "what the command wanted covered was the prison camps of northern japan. the dam was to be opened to one last orgy of home town stories, more mindless and more alike than the slow molasses drippings of four years of sloppy, apolitical, dear-mom war....i did not feel that the right way to end this war was to...chew more fodder about what-beasts-the-japs-are and jimmy-looks-skinnier-today." the u.s. military in tokyo censored approximately 55,000 words of his dispatches, along with more than 100 photographs. however, weller does not refer to governmental censorship of any photographs of his related to nagasaki. on 07/01/2009 the telegraph.co.uk published nagasaki photographs dated september 5, 1945: "after we asked readers for stories and photographs relating to britain at war, we received these fascinating photographs of nagasaki and hiroshima from cecil a. creber, who took them less than a month [nagasaki = september 5, 1945] after the atom bombs were dropped on both cities [august 6 and 9 1945]." the linlithgow gazette 28 november 2008 "amazing atomic aftermath pics set for key war archives" features a photo of creber captioned "life through a lens: cecil with his faithful ensign box camera." on 02/13/2010 mainichi published "new color footage of nagasaki a-bomb devastation shows need for greater research resources" plus a 01/05/2010 photo special [film circa september 11, 1945 found at the united states national archives in washington d.c. by professor burke-gaffney]. weller writes these correspondents "looked like yacht passengers who have stopped to buy basketry on an island." he writes that colonel mccrary "offered to take carbons of my stories and file them when airborne." the reporters under mccrary's leadership were not subject to censorship, making their dispatches especially valuable. weller writes: "i refused."

fallen dragon takes place during the 25th century. in the preceding centuries, a means of faster-than-light (ftl) space travel was discovered, allowing a speed of one-half of a light-year per day. this led to a series of colonization efforts in a globe about 70 light years around earth, but these ended as their costs proved prohibitive. the only major ongoing starflight efforts are carried out by the zantiu-braun megacorporation, who use their fleet of starships to periodically plunder their colonies in technically legal "asset realization" raids, typically involving military occupation of the planet in question. as it is cheaper to copy technology than ship it, these efforts normally collect single samples of interesting goods, or raw materials that are expensive on earth. zantiu-braun is controlled by clones of simon roderick, who is motivated by the idea of uplifting the entire human race to his ideal. the story follows the life of lawrence newton from the colony planet amethi, both in the current time and in a series of flashbacks. in the current time, newton is a mercenary in the zantiu-braun strategic security forces, who leads a squad of troopers wearing organic armor suits called "skin" that render them practically invulnerable. as a teenager, newton lived on the planet amethi and is the oldest son of one of the most powerful members of the board of the corporation which controls the planet. lawrence dreams about being a starship pilot, despite being told by his father that starship exploration is finished. lawrence loses interest in school work and withdraws socially. his father takes him to a holiday resort, where a gorgeous girl named roselyn breaks through lawrence's isolation, and the two develop a passionate relationship. roselyn eventually informs lawrence that there actually are space exploration missions through companies on earth. never having given up on his dream, he prepares to tell his father of his decision to leave school and overhears his father mentioning that roselyn was paid to meet and seduce him. in a furious rage, he decides to leave amethi immediately, and avoids detection by his father through the use of advanced quasi-sentient software called "prime", given to him by his friend vinnie. lawrence makes it to earth and scores well on the zantiu-braun officer candidacy exams, but lacking sufficient shares in the company, he is limited his strategic security job, instead of his dream of being a starship captain. as a skin, he takes part on two missions of note, which are told over a series of short vignettes. one was on the planet thallspring, which is fairly earth-like. he is stationed in the town memu bay, but takes a journey through the hinterlands to the arnoon province. during his time there he stops a trio of squaddies from a different platoon from gang-raping one of the villagers. throughout his stay, newton is bothered by something odd about the village, which seems to have a quality of living that is well beyond what one would expect given the surroundings. he is convinced they are hiding something, but can't find out what it is. the other was on the planet santa chico, where the founders modified themselves at a genetic level to coexist with the planet's biota. the mission goes disastrously wrong. as the colonists are no longer fully human, zantiu-braun's soldiers have trouble communicating with them, unable to fully comprehend their new lifestyle. the civilization has little in the way of centralized industry or anything of value to earth, and remains extremely hostile to the zantiu-braun forces. their biological augmentations make them an equal match for the skins, which they invented years ago, and inflict severe casualties on the asset realization force. they eventually destroy a captured asteroid in orbit in order to create a kessler syndrome that closes the sky, making further trips to the planet impossible. newton concludes that the asset realization concept is no longer workable; the technology levels of the colony planets are growing so quickly that future missions will be too dangerous to be worthwhile. but it is this mission that apparently solves the mystery of arnoon. arnoon had, in plain sight, alien plants living on unsterilized soil bearing edible fruits. this would be impossible for thallspring technology to create, and he concludes it was provided by santa chico geneticists. lawrence plans to "realize" their unknown wealth for himself, and to use it to buy his retirement. when he learns of another mission to thallspring, he ensures his team is part of the contingent. in the time since the first mission, thallspring has advanced greatly. a small group has formed an effective resistance movement in preparation for the next asset realization mission, led by denise ebourn from arnoon. as a cover, denise works in a kindergarten, where she tells the kids supposedly fictional stories about an ancient alien galaxy-wide civilization and an alien prince named mozark. denise uses an advanced alien intelligence known as a "dragon" to enhance herself, her resistance-cell mates, and the villagers in arnoon. when the z-b mission arrives, her team uses their prime software to sabotage the zantiu-braun efforts with some effect. however, newton, now a sergent, also has prime, and uses it to return his platoon to arnoon in search of its treasure. as denise learns that lawrence is headed for arnoon village she races to intercept him. a violent confrontation takes place between lawrence's platoon and a group of arnoon villagers, ending with a wounded lawrence staggering alone towards arnoon village. when he gets there he and his skin suit are spent, and he is near death. the villagers, one of whom (denise's sister) is the girl he previously saved from being raped, revives him. they reveal that their wealth comes from a damaged alien dragon with greatly advanced technological knowledge such as the nanotechnology used to enhance the resistance movement. the dragon is a spaceliving creature, which is damaged and has lost much of its memory. to repay the dragon for its help, the villagers plan to use steal one of zantiu-braun's starships to travel to a red sun, where the dragon says its species lives. after meeting the dragon and learning its story, lawrence decides to join them, and helps them to hijack a spaceship. but they are followed by a damaged simon roderick clone, who is determined to use all means to capture the technology for himself, not even trusting his clone brothers. another simon roderick clone follows, to get the technology and to stop his clone brother from becoming the only human to possess the powerful knowledge. denise and lawrence arrive at the red star and quickly find the dragons. they learn that the dragons are a disengaged race who do nothing but amass knowledge, sharing it freely with others. the arnoon dragon was simply a seed, one out of billions, and no more important to them than a single sperm cell is to humans. since they arrived first, denise and lawrence convince the red star dragon that the deranged simon roderick will misuse their knowledge, and the dragon disables his ship. the dragon civilization gives their patternform construction knowledge to lawrence, denise and to the other simon roderick, in an agreement arranged by denise and lawrence so that the knowledge will be shared freely on earth, and not monopolized by zantiu-braun. lawrence uses the technology to construct the spaceship he has wanted since he was a teenager. he flies back in time through an ancient time portal, mentioned in denise's kindergarten story, and then travels to amethi. there he uses the technology to transform into vinnie, one of young lawrence's closest friends. after giving young lawrence the prime program so he can travel to earth, "vinnie" changes into young lawrence, and goes to make up with roselyn. the book has four separate story threads. the threads are told in parallel in the book, merging at the end. *young lawrence newton's life on amethi and becoming a zantiu-braun squaddie sergeant. *adult lawrence newton's life as a zantiu-braun squaddie sergeant preparing for the asset realization expedition to thallspring. *denise ebourn from arnoon village and her resistance group's preparation for and battle against the thallspring asset realization expedition. *the alien prince mozark's journey in the galaxy-wide ring empire, a story told by denise ebourn to the kindergarten children. *limited perspective and narrative view point from simon roderick;

the story starts with the philologist elwin ransom, some years after his return from mars at the end of out of the silent planet, receiving a new mission from oyarsa, the angelic ruler of mars. after summoning lewis, the first person narrator, to his country home, ransom explains to lewis that he (ransom) is to travel to perelandra (venus), where is located a new garden of eden and a new adam and eve, to oppose the diabolically-possessed human physicist professor weston, who has been sent to corrupt the eve figure. he is transported in a boxlike vessel seemingly made of ice, which contains only himself. he gets lewis to blindfold him so the sunlight will not blind him once he travels beyond the earth's atmosphere. he does not wear any clothes on the journey as oyarsa tells him clothes are unnecessary on venus. he returns to earth about a year later and is met by lewis and another friend: the remainder of the story is told from ransom's point of view, with lewis acting as interlocutor and occasional commentator. ransom arrives in venus after a journey in which he is surrounded by bright colours; the box dissolves leaving ransom on what appears to be an oceanic paradise. one day is about 23 earth hours, in contrast to the (roughly) 24 and 25-hour days of earth and mars. the sky is golden and very bright but opaque. hence the sun cannot be seen, and the night is pitch black with no stars visible. strange, mythical creatures resembling small dragons roam the planetary sweet-water ocean, which is dotted with floating rafts of vegetation. these rafts resemble islands, to the extent of having plant and animal life upon them; however, having no geologic foundations, they are in a constant state of motion. the planet's sole observable geological feature is a mountain called the fixed land. ransom meets tinidril, the queen of the planet; a cheerful being who soon accepts him as a friend. unlike the inhabitants of mars in out of the silent planet, she resembles a human in physical appearance with the exception of her skin color, green; this is said to be the preferred form assumed by sentient creatures as a result of the manifestation of maleldil, the second person of god, in human form. she and the king of the planet, who is largely unseen until the end, are the only human inhabitants and are the eve and adam of their world. they live on the floating raft-islands and are forbidden to sleep on the "fixed land". the rafts or floating islands are indeed paradise, not only in the sense that they provide a pleasant and care-free life (until the arrival of weston) but also in the sense that ransom is for weeks and months naked in the presence of a beautiful naked woman without once lusting after her or being tempted to seduce her. the plot thickens when professor weston arrives in a spaceship and lands in a part of the ocean quite close to the fixed land. he at first announces that he is a reformed man, but appears to still be in search of power. he pledges allegiance to what he calls the "life-force", and subsequently shows signs of demonic possession. weston finds the queen and tries to tempt her into defying maleldil's orders by spending a night on the fixed land. ransom, perceiving this, believes that he must act as a counter-tempter. well versed in the bible and christian theology, ransom realises that if the pristine queen, who has never heard of evil, succumbs to weston's arguments, the fall of man will be re-enacted on perelandra. he struggles through day after day of lengthy arguments illustrating various approaches to temptation, but the demonic weston shows super-human brilliance in debate (though when "off-duty" he displays moronic, asinine behaviour and small-minded viciousness) and moreover appears never to need sleep. with the demonic weston on the verge of winning, the desperate ransom hears in the night what he gradually realises is a divine voice, commanding him to physically attack the tempter. ransom is reluctant, and debates with the divine (inner) voice for the entire duration of the night. a curious twist is introduced here; whereas the name "ransom" is said to be derived from the title "ranolf's son", it can also refer to a reward given in exchange for a treasured life. recalling this, and recalling that his god would (and has) sacrificed himself in a similar situation, ransom decides to confront the tempter outright. ransom attacks his opponent bare-handed, using only physical force. the tempter, unable to withstand this despite his superior abilities of rhetoric, flees, whereupon ransom chases him over the ocean, weston fleeing and ransom chasing on the backs of giant and friendly fish. during a fleeting truce, the 'real' weston momentarily re-inhabits his body, and recounts his experience of hell, wherein the damned soul is not consigned to pain or fire, as supposed by popular eschatology, but is absorbed into the devil, losing all independent existence. while ransom is distracted by his horror and his feelings of pity and compassion for weston, the demon takes control of the body, surprises ransom, and tries to drown him. the chase continues into a subterranean cavern, where ransom seemingly kills weston and, believing his quest to be over, searches for a route to the surface. weston's body, horribly injured but still animated by the devil, follows him. when they meet for the last time in another cavern, ransom "hurls" at weston's head a stone and consigns the body to volcanic flames. returning to the planet's surface after a long travail through the caverns of perelandra, ransom recuperates from his injuries, all of which heal fully except for a bite on his heel which he sustained at some point in the battle; this bite continues bleeding for the rest of his time on perelandra and is remains unhealed when he returns to earth. ransom meets the king and queen together with the oyéresu of mars and venus, the latter of whom transfers its divinely ordained dominion over the planet to the king and queen. all the characters celebrate the prevention of a second biblical "fall" and the beginning of a utopian paradise in this new world. the story climaxes with ransom's vision of the essential truth of life in the solar system, and possibly of the nature of god: strongly paralleling the journeys of dante in the divine comedy. his mission on venus accomplished, he returns, rather reluctantly, to earth in the same manner in which he made the outward journey; his new mission is to continue the fight against the forces of evil on their own territory. ||| 5 ||| 5
caith mac sliabhin, condemned by the sidhe in the brothers for committing patricide, wanders along the river guagach, accompanied and tormented by dubhain, a mischievous pooka. their journey takes them to gleann fiain where a beast from the river chases caith up a hill to an isolated cottage. the occupants, twins ceannann and firinne, let caith and dubhain in and allow them to spend the night. unbeknown to caith, the birth of the twins 21 years ago set in motion a sequence of events that damned gleann fiain and cast a shadow over faery. the twins were born to fianna, queen of gleann fiain in dun glas. but unbeknown to her husband, ceannann mac ceannann, fianna was unable to conceive and had sought help from a wise-women, moragacht. moragacht struck a bargain with her, promising her twins if she lay down with a selkie, in exchange for one of the twins when they were born. but when the twins arrived (a human and a selkie) and moragacht came to claim one of them, fianna denied any knowledge of her, and mac ceannann turned moragacht away. from that day onwards, grief and misery struck the family, and mac ceannann and fianna were forced to vacate dun glas and flee with the twins to an abandoned hilltop fortress. but the loch beast, under moragacht's control, found them there and killed them all, except the twins, now aged 14, who escaped to the cottage. the witch then seized control of dun glas from where she damned all of gleann fiain. but the wards that had protected the cottage from moragacht fall when caith and dubhain arrive. riders from dun glas come and capture the twins. caith and dubhain (as a horse) give chase, but as they approach the riders, dubhain is overcome by the witch's magic and falls into the loch, abandoning caith. caith and the twins are taken to dun glas where they are locked in cells bordering the loch. caith lapses into a dream where he enters the loch to find dubhain duelling with the loch beast. he draws dubhain back to his cell, who in turn calls nuallan from faery, the bright sidhe controlling their destinies. nuallan gives caith a silver key to unlock the iron cells and so lifts a spell enabling nuallan to cast caith, dubhain and the twins out of dun glas. moragacht allows her prisoners to escape because with her magic she now holds nuallan, a bigger catch and her means to controlling faery. the twins lead caith and dubhain to the ruins of the hilltop fortress, their former home. there they make a fire with the remains of a staircase, but a ghost appears out of the smoke that transports caith back to the night of the fall of the fortress and into the body of padraic, head of mac ceannann's household. there he relives the last few hours of the family until he is killed by the beast. firinne retrieves one of the burning timbers from the fire as a keepsake, and the twins set off for the sea to search for their selkie father, with caith and dubhain in pursuit. caith finds the selkie first, a whale floundering on the beach. but when the selkie shapeshifts to a man, he is killed by one of moragacht's pursuing riders. in the ensuing confusion, caith accidentally kills ceannann. firinne is devastated by the loss of her twin brother and gives caith her keepsake from the fortress. then, revealing her selkie birth, she changes into a whale and heads out to sea. caith rides dubhain back to dun glas to free nuallan. once again dubhain is weakened by the witch's spells and caith has to enter the keep on his own. he sees nuallan helpless in his cell, but nuallan asks him to unlock it with the silver key caith unknowingly still had all this time, the key that would have given moragacht access to faery. nuallan takes the key and flees the keep, leaving caith to fend for himself. moragacht, furious at the loss of the sidhe, prepares to deal with caith, but he throws the charred piece of wood firinne gave him into the fireplace which releases padraic, the ghost from the hilltop fortress. in an act of revenge, it begins destroying dun glas and all in it. with the witch's spell now diminishing, dubhain rescues caith from the keep, while in the loch a whale from the sea turns on the beast. the shadow over faery lifts and caith and dubhain resume their travels. ||| 2 ||| 2
mr. hoppy is a shy old man who lives alone in an apartment. for many years, he has been secretly in love with mrs. silver, a woman who lives below him. mr. hoppy frequently leans over his balcony and exchanges a polite conversation with mrs. silver, but he is too shy to disclose how he feels. mrs. silver has a small pet tortoise, alfie, whom she loves very much. one morning, mrs. silver mentions to mr. hoppy that even though she has had alfie for many years, he weighs only thirteen ounces, and she desires that he become a more attractive weight. this inspires mr. hoppy to claim that he can make tortoises grow bigger with a magic spell, which he tells mrs. silver will make alfie grow if it is whispered into his ear three times a day. the title of the book comes from this spell, a simple invocation for a tortoise to grow, but with each word written backwards and some spaced unusually, such as "esio trot" (tortoise). mrs. silver is doubtful, but agrees to try. mr. hoppy then buys many tortoises of various sizes from various pet shops, none that weigh less than thirteen ounces. he houses them in a corral within the living room of his apartment, and with the help of a special long claw, can grab one tortoise from mrs. silver's balcony and replace it with a slightly larger one while she is away at work. all of the tortoises are similar enough in appearance to alfie that mrs. silver never notices that an exchange has been made. due to the gradual nature of the change, mrs. silver does not notice that her pet tortoise is growing until he can no longer fit into his house. she exclaims to mr. hoppy that his spell has been effective, and verifies that alfie now weighs twenty-seven ounces. he asks to see and runs down the stairs to do so. mrs. silver embraces him in admiration of his spell and, emboldened by this gesture, mr. hoppy proposes to her, which she accepts, having been expecting that he would for some time. mr. hoppy secretly returns all the tortoises in his living room back to their respective pet shops, and mr. hoppy and mrs. silver are married a few weeks later. it is then revealed that the real alfie was among those returned to the pet stores. a short time later, he was bought by a young girl who kept him in her backyard where, twenty years later, by the time she has children of her own, alfie has finally grown to twenty-seven ounces. ||| 0 ||| 0

peter l. moran, the narrator, is agent to lord arner. driving home after a dinner in winchester, he picks up maurice lenden, who in 1917 had been a fellow pilot in the royal flying corps. the story tells how lenden had been flying a photographic espionage mission for the russians, how he came to be doing that, and discusses the morality of acting as a traitor to his country. as in marazan the book expresses respect for the italian fascist movement of the time. the validity, or otherwise, of that political position requires considerable historical perspective. philip stenning (the first person narrator of marazan) appears again in this novel, once again portrayed as a 'rough diamond' with a debatable sense of moral justice. ||| 6 ||| 6

in the aftermath of hunting party, the prince was found engaged in the highly illegal and immoral sport of man-hunting. in an attempt to cover this up, lady cecelia and captain heris serrano are enlisted by the crown into quietly returning the prince to the capital. during the otherwise uneventful voyage, ron notices something surprising: the prince is far stupider than he should be as the cosseted and genengineered registered embryo he is, and considerably stupider than ron remembered him being as a child. clearly something is wrong, and poison is suggested. on rockhouse major, cecelia confronts the king. he blithely dismisses her warning. later, he mentions her discovery to one of his ministers, who repeats it to his sister, lorenza, who hates cecelia for following her dreams and has always wanted to get revenge; she uses the possibility of cecelia making the poisoning of the prince as an excuse to finally carry it out. as a skilled poisoner, she is fully capable of the deed. on the space station, heris is having the yacht overhauled and redecorated, whilst her new ex-fleet personnel are quietly engaged procuring military-grade equipment and installing it. brigdis sirkin, meanwhile, has induced her lover (amalie yrilan) into taking up a temporary environmental tech job while serrano decides whether to hire her or not. towards the end of the allotted month, the smugglers balked in hunting party attack the two when sirkin refuses to become their agent on the sweet delight, and are revealed to be benignity agents. before the badly injured sirkin is rescued by oblo and methlin meharry, yrilan is killed by a sonic weapon. no sooner had this mess been cleaned up and the ship turned over to spacenhance's redecorator than horrible news arrives from the planet: lady cecelia has suffered a "massive stroke". heris is skeptical of this diagnosis, as is brun. they maneuver to link up and begin planning how to rescue cecelia. cecelia in the mean time has been occasionally drifting to consciousness, and for increasing periods of time. what she hears is sufficient to prove that she is being deliberately prevented from recovering, her visual sense deliberately impaired and even worse, that she had been poisoned. unfortunately for cecelia, while she is not dead, she has been deemed sufficiently incapacitated that her will is being executed. in her will she had recently made a change to give the sweet delight to heris, both because she was a good friend and because heris had saved cecelia from admiral lepescu on sirialis in hunting party. berenice, cecelia's sister, had always envied her her yacht, and given the suspicious nature of cecelia's stroke and the amendment to the will, decides to sue heris for the yacht. with the yacht tied up in probate, heris's options are limited. they are further limited when the king summons heris to an audience, and quite firmly insists that she and her crew steal the sweet delight, and while avoiding arrest by the fleet, discovery of their identity and also any attacks by the benignity and their agents, take the stupid prince to the guerini republic to seek an antidote to the poison. heris has little choice but to agree, and steals the yacht and busts out of the rockhouse system at high speed. brun and ron take advantage of the lowered scrutiny and security (since heris has quite visibly left, and lorenza's agents were expecting any threat to their imprisonment of cecelia to come from her direction) to arrange for a bunch of rowdies in hot air balloons to "visit" the long-term care facility during a festival; cecelia is then evacuated in brun's balloon (ronnie having previously prepared cecelia and had the surveillance devices put on a loop). immediately they take her off-planet and eventually to her stable on the planet rotterdam, where the locals like or love her. from there they begin hiring medical experts to come treat her. heris' pickup of the prince goes badly when she proves unable to distinguish between the real prince and his clone double. the confusion is exacberated when captain arash livadhi shows with a third prince whom he believes to be the real prince, but who is likewise indistinguishable. otherwise, the trip goes smoothly, except for sirkin, who keeps making careless mistakes and whose performance is otherwise deteriorating. as lady cecelia recovers and prepares to file for competency and thereby regain her estate, brun works her way back to rockhouse major via low-level jobs aboard various commercial vessels; even with this ruse, she barely avoids lorenza's hired assassins. she warns ron and the others that lorenza was the culprit and to be avoided. while cecelia is regaining control, heris leaves the three princes to the tender mercies of the guerini medical establishment and travels back to rotterdam to see cecelia. after a joyful reunion, cecelia returns to her yacht, and thence to the guerini republic. during this second trip to the republic, sirkin makes one mistake too many, and is relieved of her duties by heris, who now suspects her of being a benignity agent. however, merely taking her off-duty soon appears to be insufficient when a course modification puts them almost on top of a benignity space-fleet base. when bridge computers begin malfunctioning, heris orders the relatively new crew-member skoterin to break out the small arms in the security lockers against whatever sirkin might be planning. cecelia is convinced that skoterin and not sirkin is the traitor, and breaks sirkin out of her quarters. when they (cecelia's aide, a prince, and sirkin) try to intercept skoterin before she opens the lockers, they fail and are ambushed. skoterin explains that her plan as a benignity agent was to get revenge on heris for killing two family members and to skillfully have it all blamed on sirkin. when he tries to stop her from shooting sirkin, the prince is killed. cecelia and sirkin are only saved when petris attacks skoterin from behind. the internal revolt quenched, all attention is turned to the attacking benignity ships, now being harried by livadhi's cruiser. defeating two, they quickly beat a retreat to the guerini. there sirkin and cecelia are treated with stunning success; cecelia is rejuvenated to herself as she was at 40 years of age, restored in all senses and capacities. now cured, cecelia's next task is to punish lorenza. she travels to the familias grand council, at which event lorenza is sure to be. the prince's death (for cecelia is sure that the one of the three who sacrificed himself so heroically was the real prince) finally convinces the king that his policies have led to nothing but to disaster; his only course is to resign. lorenza notices cecelia's presence, hale and hearty and rejuvenated, and panics, fleeing wildly. she turns to the same therapist/benignity agent who had arranged for yrilan's death, seeking safe transportation away from the familias; for her mistakes, the therapist gasses lorenza to death. ||| 2 ||| 5

one day, the popper family tunes in to a radio broadcast by an admiral traveling to many countries. mr. popper had previously sent the admiral fan mail, and the admiral promises mr. popper a surprise. the surprise turns out to be a penguin, which comes in a large box. mr. popper names the penguin "captain cook" after the famous james cook. mr. popper cleans out the icebox so that the penguin can sleep inside. as time goes by, the poppers find that captain cook is growing large, but his health is failing. mr. popper writes to the curator of a large aquarium, asking for help. the curator replies that the aquarium has a female penguin, greta, who unfortunately is also experiencing the same symptoms, and he suggests that perhaps the penguins are simply lonely. soon after, the poppers receive their second penguin in the mail. the pair of penguins are revitalized by each other's presence. as both birds cannot fit into the icebox together, mr. popper opens the window to let in the cold winter air, creating a snow-covered habitat. as this solution will not work in springtime, mr. popper has the main things moved upstairs and a freezing plant installed in the basement for the birds. as time passes, greta lays an egg. she continues laying a new egg every three days until the total reaches ten. as penguins do not normally lay so many eggs, mr. popper attributes this to the change in climate the birds have experienced. when the eggs hatch, the popper family now has twelve penguins to feed, and the contractor is looking for payment on the household changes. mr. popper decides to raise money by training the twelve penguins and turning them into a circus act. the act debuts at the local theater, and soon the "popper's performing penguins" are featured throughout the country. but in the theater in new york, the penguins cause trouble; what's worse, they've accidentally shown up at the wrong theater. the manager of the wrong theater is extremely angry and has mr. popper arrested, along with the penguins. admiral drake, having arrived to see popper's performing penguins for himself, posts bail for mr. popper. after speaking with the admiral, mr. popper decides that show business is no life for a penguin. drake lets all of the twelve penguins go with him on his expedition to the north pole, where they will be released experimentally into the arctic. the poppers are sad to see the penguins go, especially mr. popper himself — that is, until admiral drake invites mr. popper to accompany him on the trip. the poppers wave goodbye as mr. popper and his penguins sail away towards the north pole and mr. popper promises to be back in a year or two. ||| 0 ||| 0
turpentine jake is an epic play about the turpentiners, african-american men who worked fourteen hours a day harvesting pine gum from the longleaf pines in the florida panhandle. this forgotten chapter of american history (1890-1960) illustrates the story of blacks held under debt peonage, earning less than the cost of food and clothing provided by the company store. co-authors linda bannister and james e. hurd, jr. based the drama on the true story of hurd’s grandfather and oral histories gathered from surviving turpentine workers. the play follows jake, a legendary storyteller and mentor to those in the camps, as he spins tales and songs that help his fellow workers assert some control over their oppressive environment. a drama with music and original folktales, the play has a total of twenty-one roles. double casting can bring the number down to nine or ten actors, if preferred. the set and costumes can be abstract or minimalist, with mere suggestions of the pine forest and turpentine camps. productions can be mounted relatively easily, but offer high impact and strong audience involvement, as well as address slavery issues more timely than ever, given rising worldwide human trafficking. the play’s premiere was staged in workshop at loyola marymount’s del rey theatre and received two naacp theatre award nominations. constance congdon, playwright in residence at amherst college writes, “turpentine jake is a play full of mystery and song, with an epic story and indelible characters. i left the theater feeling thanks and hopeful about what theater can accomplish with wonderful material.” “while the historical setting of turpentine jake takes place more than fifty years ago, debt peonage is as much an issue in the present as it was in the past. turpentine jake is a play for our time,” says elias wondimu, publisher and editorial director, marymount institute press and tsehai publishers. ||| 4 ||| 0
